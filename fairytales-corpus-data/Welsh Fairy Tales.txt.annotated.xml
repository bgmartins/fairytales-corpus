	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='7'>Although I never saw you, since you died in 1804, I am glad you were one of those Welshmen who opposed the policy of King George III and that you, after coming to America in 1783, were among the first sea captains to carry the American flag around the world. That you knew many of the Free Quakers and other patriots of the Revolution and that they buried you among them, near Benjamin Franklin, is a matter of pride to your descendants. That you were born in Wales and spoke Welsh, as did also those three great prophets of spiritual liberty, Roger Williams, William Penn, and Thomas Jefferson, is still further ground for pride in one"s ancestry.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='39'>Long, long ago, there was a good saint named <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='saint;people;manners;long;thing;way' adjectives='early;many;good;cymric' verbs='enjoy;be;teach;name;eat' valence='6.34615384615' arousal='3.78615384615' dominance='5.77923076923'>David</entity>, who taught the early Cymric or Welsh people better manners and many good things to eat and ways of enjoying themselves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='40'>Now the Welsh folks in speaking of their good teacher pronounced his name Tafid and affectionately Taffy, and this came to be the usual name for a person born in Wales. In our nurseries we all learned that "Taffy was a Welshman," but it was their enemies who made a bad rhyme about <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rhyme;enemy;nursery;taffy' adjectives='bad' verbs='be;make;learn' valence='5.445' arousal='4.18916666667' dominance='5.105'>Taffy</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='41'>Wherever there were cows or goats, people could get milk. So they always had what was necessary for a good meal, whether it were breakfast, dinner or supper. Milk, cream, curds, whey and cheese enriched the family table. Were not these enough?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='42'>But Saint <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cheese;life;people;food;saint;creature' adjectives='delicious' verbs='take;be;teach;make;do' valence='6.23923076923' arousal='4.21384615385' dominance='5.73846153846'>David</entity> taught the people how to make a still more delicious food out of cheese, and that this could be done without taking the life of any creature.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='43'>Saint David showed the girls how to take cheese, slice and toast it over the coals, or melt it in a skillet and pour it hot over toast or biscuit. This gave the cheese a new and sweeter flavor. When spread on bread, either plain, or browned over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='king;combination;fit;delicacy;anything;result;bread' adjectives='known;equal' verbs='brown;spread;be' valence='5.75142857143' arousal='4.17428571429' dominance='5.61357142857'>the fire</entity>, the result, in combination, was a delicacy fit for a king, and equal to anything known.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='44'>The fame of this new addition to the British bill of fare spread near and far. The English people, who had always been fond of rabbit pie, and still eat thousands of Molly Cotton Tails every day, named it "Welsh Rabbit," and thought it one of the best things to eat. In fact, there are many people, who do not easily see a joke, who misunderstand the fun, or who suppose the name to be either slang, or vulgar, or a mistake, and who call it "rarebit." It is like "Cape Cod turkey" (codfish), or "<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='turkey;name;potato;fish;cookery;cod;duck;cape;codfish;plum' adjectives='such;fancy;funny' verbs='dry;be' valence='6.16769230769' arousal='3.76615384615' dominance='5.77846153846'>Bombay</entity> ducks" (dried fish), or "Irish plums" (potatoes) and such funny cookery with fancy names.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>Now up to this time, the rabbits and hares had been so hunted with the aid of dogs, that there was hardly a chance of any of them surviving the cruel slaughter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='46'>In the year 604, the Prince of Powys was out hunting. The dogs started a hare, and pursued it into a dense thicket. When the hunter with the horn came up, a strange sight met his eyes. There he saw a lovely maiden. She was kneeling on the ground and devoutly praying. Though surprised at this, the prince was anxious to secure his game. He hissed on the hounds and ordered the horn to be blown, for the dogs to charge on their prey, expecting them to bring him the game at once. Instead of this, though they were trained dogs and would fight even a wolf, they slunk away howling, and frightened, as if in pain, while the horn stuck fast to the lips of the blower and he was silent. Meanwhile, the hare nestled under the maiden"s dress and seemed not in the least disturbed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='47'>Amazed at this, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lady' adjectives='fair' verbs='ask;amaze;turn' valence='6.40666666667' arousal='4.23333333333' dominance='5.77666666667'>the prince</entity> turned to the fair lady and asked:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='48'>"Who are you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>She answered, "My mother named me Monacella. I have fled from Ireland, where my father wished to marry me to one of his chief men, whom I did not love. Under God"s guidance, I came to this secret desert place, where I have lived for fifteen years, without seeing the face of man."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='50'>To this, the prince in admiration replied: "O most worthy Melangell [which is the way the Welsh pronounce Monacella], because, on account of thy merits, it has pleased God to shelter and save this little, wild hare, I, on my part, herewith present thee with this land, to be for the service of God and an asylum for all men and women, who seek thy protection. So long as they do not pollute this sanctuary, let none, not even prince or chieftain, drag them forth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>The beautiful saint passed the rest of her life in this place. At night, she slept on the bare rock. Many were the wonders wrought for those who with pure hearts sought her refuge. The little wild hares were under her special protection, and they are still called "Melangell"s Lambs."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='53'>II</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='54'>THE MIGHTY MONSTER AFANG</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>After the Cymric folk, that is, the people we call Welsh, had come up from Cornwall into their new land, they began to cut down the trees, to build towns, and to have fields and gardens. Soon they made the landscape smile with pleasant homes, rich farms and playing children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>They trained vines and made flowers grow. The young folks made pets of the wild animals" cubs, which their fathers and big brothers brought home from hunting. Old men took rushes and reeds and wove them into cages for song birds to live in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>While they were draining the swamps and bogs, they drove out the monsters, that had made their lair in these wet places. These terrible creatures liked to poison people with their bad breath, and even ate up very little boys and girls, when they strayed away from home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='58'>So all the face of the open country between the forests became very pretty to look at. The whole of Cymric land, which then extended from the northern <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='edge;land;whole;place;fort' adjectives='big;delightful;northern' verbs='become;live;call;extend' valence='6.11866666667' arousal='3.96133333333' dominance='5.736'>Grampian Hills</entity> to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='edge;land;whole;place;fort' adjectives='big;delightful;northern' verbs='become;live;call;extend' valence='6.11866666667' arousal='3.96133333333' dominance='5.736'>Cornwall</entity>, and from the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='edge;land;whole;place;fort' adjectives='big;delightful;northern' verbs='become;live;call;extend' valence='6.11866666667' arousal='3.96133333333' dominance='5.736'>Irish Sea</entity>, past their big fort, afterward called <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='edge;land;whole;place;fort' adjectives='big;delightful;northern' verbs='become;live;call;extend' valence='6.11866666667' arousal='3.96133333333' dominance='5.736'>London</entity>, even to the edge of the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='edge;land;whole;place;fort' adjectives='big;delightful;northern' verbs='become;live;call;extend' valence='6.11866666667' arousal='3.96133333333' dominance='5.736'>German Ocean</entity>, became a delightful place to live in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>The lowlands and the rivers, in which the tide rose and fell daily, were especially attractive. This was chiefly because of the many bright flowers growing there; while the yellow gorse and the pink heather made the hills look as lovely as a young girl"s face. Besides this, the Cymric maidens were the prettiest ever, and the lads were all brave and healthy; while both of these knew how to sing often and well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>Now there was a great monster named the Afang, that lived in a big bog, hidden among the high hills and inside of a dark, rough forest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>This ugly creature had an iron-clad back and a long tail that could wrap itself around a mountain. It had four front legs, with big knees that were bent up like a grasshopper"s, but were covered with scales like armor. These were as hard as steel, and bulged out at the thighs. Along its back, was a ridge of horns, like spines, and higher than an alligator"s. Against such a tough hide, when the hunters shot their darts and hurled their javelins, these weapons fell down to the ground, like harmless pins.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>On this monster"s head, were big ears, half way between those of a jackass and an elephant. Its eyes were as green as leeks, and were round, but scalloped on the edges, like squashes, while they were as big as pumpkins.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>The Afang"s face was much like a monkey"s, or a gorilla"s, with long straggling gray hairs around its cheeks like those of a walrus. It always looked as if a napkin, as big as a bath towel, would be necessary to keep its mouth clean. Yet even then, it slobbered a good deal, so that no nice fairy liked to be near the monster.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>When the Afang growled, the bushes shook and the oak leaves trembled on the branches, as if a strong wind was blowing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>But after its dinner, when it had swallowed down a man, or two calves, or four sheep, or a fat heifer, or three goats, its body swelled up like a balloon. Then it usually rolled over, lay along the ground, or in the soft mud, and felt very stupid and sleepy, for a long while.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>All around its lair, lay wagon loads of bones of the creatures, girls, women, men, boys, cows, and occasionally a donkey, which it had devoured.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>But when the Afang was ravenously hungry and could not get these animals and when fat girls and careless boys were scarce, it would live on birds, beasts and fishes. Although it was very fond of cows and sheep, yet the wool and hair of these animals stuck in its big teeth, it often felt very miserable and its usually bad temper grew worse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>Then, like a beaver, it would cut down a tree, sharpen it to a point and pick its teeth until its mouth was clean. Yet it seemed all the more hungry and eager for fresh human victims to eat, especially juicy maidens; just as children like cake more than bread.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>The Cymric men were not surprised at this, for they knew that girls were very sweet and they almost worshiped women. So they learned to guard their daughters and wives. They saw that to do such things as eating up people was in the nature of the beast, which could never be taught good manners.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>But what made them mad beyond measure was the trick which the monster often played upon them by breaking the river banks, and the dykes which with great toil they had built to protect their crops. Then the waters overflowed all their farms, ruined their gardens and spoiled their cow houses and stables.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='71'>This sort of mischief the Afang liked to play, especially about the time when the oat and barley crops were ripe and ready to be gathered to make cakes and flummery; that is sour oat-jelly, or pap. So it often happened that the children had to do without their cookies and porridge during the winter. Sometimes the floods rose so high as to wash away the houses and float the cradles. Even those with little babies in them were often seen on the raging waters, and sent dancing on the waves down <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='baby;water;wave;dancing' adjectives='little' verbs='be;see;send;rage' valence='6.106' arousal='4.023' dominance='5.343'>the river</entity>, to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='baby;water;wave;dancing' adjectives='little' verbs='be;see;send;rage' valence='6.106' arousal='4.023' dominance='5.343'>the sea</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='72'>Once in a while, a mother cat and all her kittens were seen mewing for help, or a lady dog howling piteously. Often it happened that both puppies and kittens were drowned.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>So, whether for men or mothers, pussies or puppies, the Cymric men thought the time had come to stop this monster"s mischief. It was bad enough that people should be eaten up, but to have all their crops ruined and animals drowned, so that they had to go hungry all winter, with only a little fried fish, and no turnips, was too much for human patience. There were too many weeping mothers and sorrowful fathers, and squalling brats and animals whining for something to eat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>Besides, if all the oats were washed away, how could their wives make flummery, without which, no Cymric man is ever happy? And where would they get seed for another year"s sowing? And if there were no cows, how could the babies or kitties live, or any grown-up persons get buttermilk?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='75'>Someone may ask, why did not some brave man shoot the Afang, with a poisoned arrow, or drive a spear into him under the arms, where the flesh was tender, or cut off his head with a sharp sword?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>The trouble was just here. There were plenty of brave fellows, ready to fight the monster, but nothing made of iron could pierce that hide of his. This was like armor, or one of the steel battleships of our day, and the Afang always spit out fire or poison breath down the road, up which a man was coming, long before the brave fellow could get near him. Nothing would do, but to go up into his lair, and drag him out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>But what man or company of men was strong enough to do this, when a dozen giants in a gang, with ropes as thick as a ship"s hawser, could hardly tackle the job?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='78'>Nevertheless, in what neither man nor giant could do, a pretty maiden might succeed. True, she must be brave also, for how could she know, but if hungry, the Afang might eat her up?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='79'>However, one valiant damsel, of great beauty, who had lots of perfumery and plenty of pretty clothes, volunteered to bind the monster in his lair. She said, "I"m not afraid." Her sweetheart was named Gadern, and he was a young and strong hunter. He talked over the matter with her and they two resolved to act together.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='80'>Gadern went all over the country, summoning the farmers to bring their ox teams and log chains. Then he set the blacksmiths to work, forging new and especially heavy ones, made of the best native iron, from the mines, for which <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='blacksmith;mine;iron;one' adjectives='heavy;new;famous;best;native' verbs='work;forge;make;set;be' valence='5.70416666667' arousal='3.65666666667' dominance='5.54583333333'>Wales</entity> is still famous.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>Meanwhile, the lovely maiden arrayed herself in her prettiest clothes, dressed her hair in the most enticing way, hanging a white blossom on each side, over her ears, with one flower also at her neck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='82'>When she had perfumed her garments, she sallied forth and up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;garment;monster;bog' adjectives='big;perfumed' verbs='be;hide;sally;have' valence='5.48' arousal='3.863' dominance='5.525'>the lake</entity> where the big bog and the waters were and where the monster hid himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='83'>While the maiden was still quite a distance away, the terrible Afang, scenting his visitor from afar, came rushing out of his lair. When very near, he reared his head high in the air, expecting to pounce on her, with his iron clad claws and at one swallow make a breakfast of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='claw;head;breakfast;iron;air' adjectives='high;clad' verbs='pounce;swallow;expect;rear;make' valence='5.75785714286' arousal='4.21285714286' dominance='5.49785714286'>the girl</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>But the odors of her perfumes were so sweet, that he forgot what he had thought to do. Moreover, when he looked at her, he was so taken with unusual beauty, that he flopped at once on his forefeet. Then he behaved just like a lovelorn beau, when his best girl comes near. He ties his necktie and pulls down his coat and brushes off the collar.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>So the Afang began to spruce up. It was real fun to see how a monster behaves when smitten with love for a pretty girl. He had no idea how funny he was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>The girl was not at all afraid, but smoothed the monster"s back, stroked and played with its big moustaches and tickled its neck until the Afang"s throat actually gurgled with a laugh. Pretty soon he guffawed, for he was so delighted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='87'>When he did this, the people down in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thunder;sky;people' adjectives='blue;clear' verbs='do;think;be' valence='6.218' arousal='3.605' dominance='5.549'>the valley</entity> thought it was thunder, though the sky was clear and blue.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>The maiden tickled his chin, and even put up his whiskers in curl papers. Then she stroked his neck, so that his eyes closed. Soon she had gently lulled him to slumber, by singing a cradle song, which her mother had taught her. This she did so softly, and sweetly, that in a few minutes, with its head in her lap, the monster was sound asleep and even began to snore.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>Then, quietly, from their hiding places in the bushes, Gadern and his men crawled out. When near the dreaded Afang, they stood up and sneaked forward, very softly on tip toe. They had wrapped the links of the chain in grass and leaves, so that no clanking was heard. They also held the oxen"s yokes, so that nobody or anything could rattle, or make any noise. Slowly but surely they passed the chain over its body, in the middle, besides binding the brute securely between its fore and hind legs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='90'>All this time, the monster slept on, for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='melody;monster;time' adjectives='' verbs='croon;sleep;keep' valence='5.915' arousal='4.34666666667' dominance='5.315'>the girl</entity> kept on crooning her melody.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>When the forty yoke of oxen were all harnessed together, the drovers cracked all their whips at once, so that it sounded like a clap of thunder and the whole team began to pull together.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>Then the Afang woke up with a start.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='93'>The sudden jerk roused the monster to wrath, and its bellowing was terrible. It rolled round and round, and dug its four sets of toes, each with three claws, every one as big as a plowshare, into the ground. It tried hard to crawl into its lair, or slip into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lair' adjectives='hard' verbs='try;crawl;slip' valence='5.06666666667' arousal='4.135' dominance='5.02333333333'>the lake</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>Finding that neither was possible, the Afang looked about, for some big tree to wrap its tail around. But all his writhings or plungings were of no use. The drovers plied their whips and the oxen kept on with one long pull together and forward. They strained so hard, that one of them dropped its eye out. This formed a pool, and to this day they call it The Pool of the Ox"s Eye. It never dries up or overflows, though the water in it rises and falls, as regularly as the tides.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>For miles over the mountains the sturdy oxen hauled the monster. The pass over which they toiled and strained so hard is still named the Pass of the Oxen"s Slope. When going down hill, the work of dragging the Afang was easier.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>In a great hole in the ground, big enough to be a pond, they dumped the carcass of the Afang, and soon a little lake was formed. This uncanny bit of water is called "The Lake of the Green Well." It is considered dangerous for man or beast to go too near it. Birds do not like to fly over the surface, and when sheep tumble in, they sink to the bottom at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>If the bones of the Afang still lie at the bottom, they must have sunk down very deep, for the monster had no more power to get out, or to break the river banks. The farmers no longer cared anything about the creature, and they hardly every think of the old story, except when a sheep is lost.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>As for Gadern and his brave and lovely sweetheart, they were married and lived long and happily. Their descendants, in the thirty-seventh generation, are proud of the grand exploit of their ancestors, while all the farmers honor his memory and bless the name of the lovely girl that put the monster asleep.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>THE TWO CAT WITCHES</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='102'>In old days, it was believed that the seventh son, in a family of sons, was a conjurer by nature. That is, he could work wonders like the fairies and excel the doctors in curing diseases.</paragraph>

As the tribes scattered far apart to settle in this or that valley, some had fish, but no salt, and others had plenty of salt, but no fish.

There, they seized each man a girl, not waiting for any maid to comb her hair, or put on a new frock, or pack up her clothes, or carry any thing out of her home, and made off with her, as fast as one pair of legs could move with another pair on top.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='167'>At first, this looked like rough treatment--for a lovely girl, thus to be strapped to a brawny big fellow; but after a while, the girls thought it was great fun to be married and each one to have a man to caress, and fondle, and scold, and look for, and boss around; for each wife, inside of her own hut was quite able to rule her husband.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='359'>In these early times there were a great many fairies of all sorts, but of very different kinds of behavior, good and bad.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='360'>It was in this age of the world that fairies got an idea riveted into their heads which nothing, not even hammers, chisels or crowbars can pry up. Neither horse power, nor hydraulic force nor sixteen-inch bombs, nor cannon balls, nor torpedoes can drive it out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='361'>It is a settled matter of opinion in fairy land that, compared with fairies, human beings are very stupid. The fairies think that mortals are dull witted and awfully slow, when compared to the smarter and more nimble fairies, that are always up to date in doing things.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='362'>Perhaps the following story will help explain why this is.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='363'>These ancient folks who lived in caves, could not possibly know some things that are like A B C to the fairies of to-day. For the Welsh fairies, King Puck and Queen Mab, know all about what is in the telegraphs, submarine cables and wireless telegraphy of to-day. Puck would laugh if you should say that a telephone was any new thing to him. Long ago, in Shakespeare"s time, he boasted that he could "put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes." Men have been trying ever since to catch up with him, but they have not gone ahead of him yet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='364'>If, only three hundred years ago, this were the case, what must have been Puck"s fun, when he saw men in the early days, working so hard to make even a clay cup or saucer. These people who slept and ate in cave boarding-houses, knew nothing of metals, or how to make iron or brass tools, wire, or machines, or how to touch a button and light up a whole room, which even a baby can now do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>There is one thing that we, who have traveled in many fairy lands, have often noticed and told our friends, the little folks, and that is this:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>All the fairies we ever knew are very slow to change either their opinions, or their ways, or their fashions. Like many mortals, they think a great deal of their own notions. They imagine that the only way to do a thing is in that which they say is the right one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='367'>So it came to pass that even when the Cymric folk gave up wearing the skins of animals, and put on pretty clothes woven on a loom, and ate out of dishes, instead of clam shells, there were still some fairies that kept to the notions and fashions of the cave days. To one of these, came trouble because of this failing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='368'>Now there was once a pretty nymph, who lived in the Red Lake, to which a young and handsome farmer used to come to catch fish. One misty day, when the lad could see only a few feet before him, a wind cleared the air and blew away the fog. Then he saw near him a little old man, standing on a ladder. He was hard at work in putting a thatched roof on a hut which he had built.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='369'>A few minutes later, as the mist rose and the breezes blew, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rippling;house;surface;water;s;breeze;mist' adjectives='' verbs='blow;see;rise' valence='6.21785714286' arousal='3.75785714286' dominance='5.34928571429'>the farmer</entity> could see no house, but only the ripplings of water on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='rippling;house;surface;water;s;breeze;mist' adjectives='' verbs='blow;see;rise' valence='6.21785714286' arousal='3.75785714286' dominance='5.34928571429'>the lake</entity>"s surface.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='371'>On one hot day in the early autumn, while he stopped to let his horse drink, he looked and saw a very lovely face on the water. Wondering to whom it might belong, there rose up before him the head and shoulders of a most beautiful woman. She was so pretty that he had two tumbles. He fell off his horse and he fell in love with her at one and the same time.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='372'>Rushing toward the lovely vision, he put out his arms at that spot where he had seen her, but only to embrace empty air. Then he remembered that love is blind. So he rubbed his eyes, to see if he could discern anything. Yet though he peered down into the water, and up over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water' adjectives='' verbs='peer;see' valence='6.08' arousal='3.7025' dominance='6.28'>the hills</entity>, he could not see her anywhere.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='373'>But he soon found out to his joy that his eyes were all right, for in another place, the face, flower-crowned hair, and her reflection in the water came again. Then his desire to possess the damsel was doubled. But again, she disappeared, to rise again somewhere else.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='374'>Five times he was thus tantalized and disappointed. She rose up, and quickly disappeared.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='377'>No sooner had the aroma of the apples fallen on the air, than the pretty lady of the lake bobbed up from beneath the surface, and this time quite near him. She seemed to have lost all fear, for she asked him to throw her one of the apples.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='378'>"Please come, pretty maid, and get it yourself," cried the farmer. Then he held up the red apple, turning it round and round before her, to tempt her by showing its glossy surface and rich color.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='379'>Apparently not afraid, she came up close to him and took the apple from his left hand. At once, he slipped his strong right arm around her waist, and hugged her tight. At this, she screamed loudly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>Then there appeared in the middle of the lake the old man, he had seen thatching the roof by the lake shore. This time, besides his long snowy beard, he had on his head a crown of water lilies.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='382'>At once, the farmer broke out in passionate appeal to the old man that she might become his wife. He promised to love her always, treat her well, and never be rough or cruel to her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='383'>The old father listened attentively. He was finally convinced that the farmer would make a good husband for his lovely daughter. Yet he was very sorry to lose her, and he solemnly laid one condition upon his future son-in-law.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='384'>He was never under any pretense, or in any way, to strike her with clay, or with anything made or baked from clay. Any blow with that from which men made pots and pans, and jars and dishes, or in fact, with earth of any sort, would mean the instant loss of his wife. Even if children were born in their home, the mother would leave them, and return to fairy land under <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='land;return;child;marriage;mother;home;fairy;law' adjectives='subject' verbs='leave;be;bear' valence='6.3875' arousal='4.025625' dominance='5.7075'>the lake</entity>, and be forever subject to the law of the fairies, as before her marriage.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='386'>They were married and lived very happily together. Years passed and the man was still a good husband and lover. He kept up the habit which he had learned from a sailor friend. Every night, when far from home and out on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='toast;sweetheart;wife;mate;lover;home;husband' adjectives='' verbs='become;use;drink;continue;remain' valence='6.53272727273' arousal='4.43090909091' dominance='5.90909090909'>the sea</entity>, he and his mates used to drink this toast; "Sweethearts and wives: may every sweetheart become a wife and every wife remain a sweetheart, and every husband continue a lover."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>So he proved that though a husband he was still a lover, by always doing what she asked him and more. When the children were born and grew up, their father told them about their mother"s likes and dislikes, her tastes and her wishes, and warned them always to be careful. So it was altogether a very happy family.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='388'>One day, the wife and mother said to her husband, that she had a great longing for apples. She would like to taste some like those which he long ago gave her. At once, the good man dropped what he was doing and hurried off to his neighbor, who had first presented him with a trayful of these apples.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='389'>The farmer not only got the fruit, but he also determined that he would plant a tree and thus have apples for his wife, whenever she wanted them. So he bought a fine young sapling, to set in his orchard, for the children to play under and to keep his pantry full of the fine red-cheeked fruit. At this his wife was delighted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='390'>So happy enough--in fact, too merry to think of anything else, they, both husband and wife, proceeded to set the sapling in the ground.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='391'>But farmers are sometimes very superstitious. They even believe in luck, though not in Puck. Some of them have faith in what the almanac, and the patent medicine may say, and in planting potatoes according to the moon, but they scout the idea of there being any fairies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='392'>With the farmer, this had become a fixed state of mind and now it brought him to grief, as we shall see. For though he remembered what his wife liked and disliked, and recalled what her father had told him, he had forgotten that she was a fairy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='393'>With this farmer and other Welsh mortals, it had become a habit, when planting a young tree, to throw the last shovelful of earth over the left shoulder.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='395'>At that moment, she cried out bitterly, not in pain, but in sorrow. Then she started to run towards the lake.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='523'>Now in early Cornwall there were many giants. Some were good but others were bad. One of these, a right fine fellow, was named Tom, and the other, a bad one, Blubb. This giant had had twenty wives, and was awfully cruel. Nobody ever knew what became of the twenty maidens he had married.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='524'>Now this Giant Blubb had built a mighty castle between a big hill and a river. Under it were vaults of vast size, filled with treasures of all sorts, gold, silver, jewels and gems. There were cells, in which he kept his wives, after he had married them. It was the opinion of his neighbors, that in every case, soon after the honeymoon was over, he ate them up.</paragraph>

Then he could walk by them and get the treasure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='527'>Besides these dogs, the only living thing left in the castle when the giant went out, was the latest Mrs. Blubb.

	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='528'>What made all the country round hate this cruel giant was not wholly on account of his awful appetite. It was because he had ruined the King"s High Road.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='529'>When Giant Blubb wished to enlarge his castle, he had the walls and towers built down to the river"s edge. This closed up the big road, so that people had to go far around and up over the hill, or by boat along the river. Such a roundabout way took much time and toil, and was too much trouble for all.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='566'>Centuries ago, the good monks of St. David had a school where lads were taught Latin and good manners. One of their pupils was a boy named Elidyr. He was such a poor scholar and he so hated books and loved play, that in his case spankings and whippings were almost of daily occurrence. Still he made no improvement. He was in the habit also of playing truant, or what one of the monks called "traveling to Bagdad." One of the consequences was that certain soft parts of his body--apparently provided by nature for this express purpose--often received a warming from his daddy.</paragraph>

So like them, he quenched his thirst at the brook. But when, towards noon, he could find nothing to eat, and his inside cavity seemed to enlarge with very emptiness, his hunger grew every minute.

Meanwhile, he discovered that he had a stomach, which seemed to grow more and more into an aching void. He was glad when the sunset and darkness came. His bed was no softer in the cave, as he lay down with a stone for his pillow.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='674'>In the ancient Cymric gatherings, the Druids, poets, prophets, seers, and singers all had part. The one most honored as the president of the meeting was crowned and garlanded. Then he was led in honor and sat in the chair of state. They called this great occasion an Eistedfodd, or sitting, after the Cymric word, meaning a chair.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='675'>All over the world, the Welsh folks, who do so passionately love music, poetry and their own grand language, hold the Eistedfodd at regular intervals. Thus they renew their love for the Fatherland and what they received long ago from their ancestors.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='676'>Now it happens that the fairies in every land usually follow the customs of the mortals among whom they live. The Swiss, the Dutch, the Belgian, the Japanese and Korean fairies, as we all know, although they are much alike in many things are as different from each other as the countries in which they live and play. So, when the Welsh fairies all met together, they resolved to have songs and harp music and make the piper play his tunes just as in the Eistedfodd.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='677'>The Cymric fairies of our days have had many troubles to complain of. They were disgusted with so much coal smoke, the poisoning of the air by chemical fumes, and the blackening of the landscape from so many factory chimneys. They had other grievances also.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='678'>So the Queen Mab, who had a Welsh name, and another fairy, called Pwca, or in English King Puck, sent out invitations into every part of Wales, for a gathering on the hills, near the great rock called Dina"s seat. This is a rocky chair formed by nature. They also included in their call those parts of western and south England, such as are still Welsh and spiritually almost a part of Wales. In fact, <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='land;fact;cymry' adjectives='old' verbs='be;land;come;have' valence='6.02333333333' arousal='3.56555555556' dominance='5.65111111111'>Cornwall</entity> was the old land, in which the Cymry had first landed when coming from over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='land;fact;cymry' adjectives='old' verbs='be;land;come;have' valence='6.02333333333' arousal='3.56555555556' dominance='5.65111111111'>the sea</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='679'>The meeting was to be held on a moonlight night, and far away from any houses, lest the merry making, dancing and singing of the fairies should keep the farmers awake. This was something of which the yokels, or men of the plow, often complained. They could not sleep while the fairies were having their parties.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='680'>Now among the Welsh fairies of every sort, size, dress, and behavior, some were good, others were bad, but most of them were only full of fun and mischief.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='681'>Now it had been an old custom, which had come down, from the days of the cave men, that when anyone died, the people, friends and relatives sat up all night with the corpse. The custom arose, at first, with the idea of protection against wild beasts and later from insult by enemies. This was called a wake. The watchers wept and wailed at first, and then fell to eating and drinking. Sometimes, they got to be very lively. The young folks even looked on a wake, after the first hour or two, as fine fun. Strong liquor was too plentiful and it often happened that quarrels broke out. When heads were thus fuddled, men saw or thought they saw, many uncanny things, like leather birds, cave eagles, and the like.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='682'>But all these fantastic things and creatures, such as foolish people talk about, and with which they frighten children, such as corpse candles, demons and imps, were ruled out and not invited to the fairy meeting. Some other objects, which ignorant folks believed in, were not to be allowed in the company. The door-keeper was notified not to admit the eagles of darkness, that live in a cave which is never lighted up; or the weird, featherless bird of leather, from the Land of Illusion and Phantasy, that brushes its wing against windows, when a funeral is soon to take place; or the greedy dog with silver eyes. None of these would be permitted to show themselves, even if they came and tried to get in. Some other creatures, not recognized in the good society of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='society;creature' adjectives='good;other' verbs='recognize;bar;be' valence='5.98857142857' arousal='4.08857142857' dominance='5.94857142857'>Fairyland</entity>, were also barred out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='683'>To this gathering, only the bright and lively fairies were welcome. Some of the best natured among the big creatures, and especially giants and dragons, might pay a visit, if they wanted to do so; but all the bad ones, such as lake hags, wraiths, sellers of liquids for wakes, who made men drunk, and all who, under the guise of fairies, were only agents for undertakers, were ruled out.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='685'>When they had all gathered together, at the evening hour, there was seen, in the moonlight, the funniest lot of creatures, that one could imagine, but all were neatly dressed and well behaved.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='686'>Quite a large number of the famous Fair Family, that moved only in the best society of fairyland, fathers, mothers, cousins, uncles and aunts, were on hand.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='688'>When they saw her, several learned fairies, who had come from a distance, fell at once into conversation on this subject. One remarked: "How would the Queen like to add another syllable to her name? Then we should call her Mab-gath (which means Kitten, or Little Puss)."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='689'>"Well not so bad, however; because many mortal daddies, who have a daughter, call her Puss. It is a term of affection with them and the little girls never seem to be offended."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='690'>"Oh! Suppose that in talking to each other we call our Queen Mab-gar, what then?" asked another, with a roguish twinkle in the eye.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='691'>"It depends on how you use it," said a wise one dryly. This fairy was a stickler for the correct use of every word. "If you meant "babyish," or "childish," she, or her friends might demur; but, if you use the term "love of children," what better name for a fairy queen?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='692'>"None. There could not be any," they shouted, all at once, "but let us ask our old friend the harper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='693'>Now such a thing as inquiring into each other"s ages was not common in Fairy Land. Very few ever asked such a question, for it was not thought to be polite. For, though we hear of ugly fairy brats being put into the cradles, in place of pretty children, no one ever heard, either of fairies being born or of dying, or having clocks, or watches, or looking to see what time it was. Nor did doctors, or the census clerks, or directory people ever trouble <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='census;people;clerk;doctor;directory;trouble;lady;age' adjectives='' verbs='ask;do' valence='5.46727272727' arousal='4.00727272727' dominance='5.48'>the fairy</entity> ladies, to ask their age.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='694'>Occasionally, however, there was one fairy, so wise, so learned, and so able to tell what was going to happen to-morrow, or next year, that the other fairies looked up to such an one with respect and awe.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='695'>Yet these honorables would hardly know what you were talking about, if you asked any of them how old they might be, or spoke of "old" or "young." If, by any chance, a fairy did use the world "old" in talking of their number, it would be for honor or dignity, and they would mean it for a compliment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='696'>The fact was, that many of the most lively fairies showed their frivolous disposition at once. These were of the kind, that, like kittens, cubs, or babies, wanted to play all the time, yes, every moment. Already, hundreds of them were tripping from flower to flower, riding on the backs of fireflies, or harnessing night moths, or any winged creatures they could saddle, for flight through the air. Or, they were waltzing with glow worms, or playing "ring around a rosy," or dancing in circles. They could not keep still, one moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='697'>In fact, when a great crowd of the frolicsome creatures got singing together, they made such a noise, that a squad of fairy policemen, dressed in club moss and armed with pistils, was sent to warn them not to raise their voices too high; lest the farmers, especially those that were kind to the fairies, should be awakened, and feel in bad humor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='698'>So the knot of learned fairies had a quiet time to talk, and, when able to hear their own words, the harper, who was very learned, answered their questions about <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;harper;question;knot;time;fairy' adjectives='own;able;quiet' verbs='be;hear;have;learn;answer;follow;talk' valence='6.09529411765' arousal='3.92058823529' dominance='5.94235294118'>Queen Mab</entity> as follows:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='700'>"It is well named," said another fairy savant, "since Queen Mab is the only fairy that waits on men. She inspires their dreams, when these are born in their brains."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='701'>The talk now turned on Puck, who was to be the president of the meeting. They were expected to show much dignity in his presence, but some feared he would, as usual, play his pranks. Before he arrived in his chariot, which was drawn by dragon flies, some of his neighbors that lived in the valley near by chatted about him, until the gossip became quite personal.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='747'>Outshining all, was a golden throne at the farther end of the table and on it sat a king. He was of imposing stature, and august presence. Upon his head was a crown, on which were inlaid or set precious stones. These shone by their own light, sending out rays so brilliant that they dazzled Taffy, who had never seen anything like them. The king held in his right hand a mighty sword. It had a history and the name of it was Excalibur. In Arthur"s hand, it was almost part of his own soul. Its hilt and handle were of finely chased gold, richly studded with gems. Yet his head, too, was bent in deep sleep, as if only thunder could wake him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='991'>In the meantime, Rhiannon planned with Powell to get out of the trouble. For this purpose, she gave him a magical bag, which he was to use when the right time should come.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1007'>WHY THE BACK DOOR WAS FRONT</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1008'>In the days when were no books, or writing, and folk tales were the only ones told, there was an old woman, who had a bad reputation. She pretended to be very poor, so as not to attract or tempt robbers. Yet those who knew her best, knew also, as a subject of common talk, that she was always counting out her coins.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1009'>Besides this, she lived in a nice house, and it was believed that she made a living by stealing babies out of their cradles to sell to the bad fairies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1010'>It was matter of rumor that she would, for an extra large sum, take a wicked fairy"s ugly brat, and put it in place of a mother"s darling.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1011'>In addition to these horrid charges against her, it was rumored that she laid a spell, or charm, on the cattle of people whom she did not like, in order to take revenge on them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1012'>The old woman denied all this, and declared it was only silly gossip of envious people who wanted her money. She lived so comfortably, she averred, because her son, who was a stone mason, who made much money by building chimneys, which had then first come into fashion. When he brought to her the profits of his jobs, she counted the coins, and because of this, some people were jealous, and told bad stories about her. She declared she was thrifty, but neither a miser, nor a kidnaper, nor a witch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1013'>One day, this old woman wanted more feathers to stuff into her bed, to make it softer and feel pleasanter for her old bones to rest upon, for what she slept on was nearly worn through. So she went to a farm, where they were plucking geese, and asked for a few handfuls of feathers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1014'>But the rich farmer"s people refused and ordered her out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='people;yard;farmer' adjectives='rich' verbs='s;refuse;order' valence='5.60375' arousal='4.18625' dominance='5.78875'>the farm</entity> yard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1015'>Shortly after this event, the cows of this farmer, who was opposed to chimneys, and did not like her or her son, suffered dreadfully from the disease called the black quarter. As they had no horse doctors or professors of animal economy, or veterinaries in those days, many of the cows died. The rich farmer lost much money, for he had now no milk or beef to sell. At once, he suspected that his cattle were bewitched, and that the old woman had cast a spell on them. In those days, it was very easy to think so.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1016'>So the angry man went one day to the old crone, when she was alone, and her stout son was away on a distant job. He told her to remove the charm, which she had laid on his beasts, or he would tie her arms and legs together, and pitch her into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beast;charm;arm;leg' adjectives='' verbs='remove;lay;have;pitch;tie;tell' valence='5.70166666667' arousal='3.7725' dominance='5.44333333333'>the river</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1017'>The old woman denied vehemently that she possessed any such powers, or had ever practiced such black arts.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1018'>To make sure of it, the farmer made her say out loud, "The Blessing of God be upon your cattle!" To clinch the matter, he compelled her to repeat the Lord"s Prayer, which she was able to do, without missing one syllable. She used the form of words which are not found in the prayer book, but are in the Bible, and was very earnest, when she prayed "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1019'>But after all that trouble, and the rough way which the rich farmer took to save his cattle, his efforts were in vain. In spite of that kind of religion which he professed--which was shown by bullying a poor old woman--his cattle were still sick, with no sign of improvement. He was at his wits" end to know what to do next.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1020'>Now, as we have said, this was about the time that chimneys came into fashion. In very old days, the Cymric house was a round hut, with a thatched roof, without glass windows, and the smoke got out through the door and holes in the walls, in the best way it could. The only tapestry in the hut was in the shape of long festoons of soot, that hung from the roof or rafters. These, when the wind blew, or the fire was lively, would swing or dance or whirl, and often fall on the heads, or into the food, while the folks were eating. When the children cried, or made wry faces at the black stuff, their daddy only laughed, and said it was healthy, or was for good luck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1021'>But by and by, the carpenters and masons made much improvement, especially when, instead of flint hatchets, they had iron axes and tools. Then they hewed down trees, that had thick cross branches and set up columns in the center, and made timber walls and rafters. Then the house was square or oblong.

It made his coat bulge out, and at this, some of the fairies wondered, but all they thought of was that this spoiled a handsome fellow"s figure. Or was it some new idea? To tell the truth, they were vexed at not keeping up with the new fashions, for they knew nothing of this latest fad among such fine young gallants.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1111'>Much of the chat and gossip, before and after the meeting, was between the fairies who live in the air, or on mountains, and those down in the earth, or deep in the sea. They swapped news, gossip and scandal at a great rate.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1112'>There were a dozen or two fine-looking creatures who had high brows, who said they were Co-eds. This did not mean that these fairies had ever been through college. "Certainly the college never went through them," said one very homely fairy, who was spiteful and jealous. The simple fact was that the one they called Betty, the Co-ed, and others from that Welsh village, called Bryn Mawr, and another from Flint, and another from Yale, and still others from Brimbo and from Co-ed Poeth, had come from places so named and down on the map of Wales, though they were no real Co-ed girls there, that could talk French, or English, or read Latin. In fact, Co-ed simply meant that they were from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='co-ed;tree;forest;fact' adjectives='co-ed' verbs='be;live;mean' valence='5.484' arousal='4.066' dominance='5.393'>the woods</entity> and lived among the trees; for Co-ed in Welsh means a forest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1113'>The fairy police were further instructed not to admit, and, if such were found, to put out the following bad characters, for this was a perfectly respectable meeting. These naughty folks were:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1114'>The Old Hag of the Mist.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1115'>The Invisible Hag that moans dolefully in the night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1116'>The Tolaeth, a creature never seen, but that groans, sings, saws, or stamps noisily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1117'>The Dogs of the Sky.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1118'>All witches, of every sort and kind.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1119'>All peddlers of horseshoes, crosses, charms, or amulets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1120'>All mortals with brains fuddled by liquor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1121'>All who had on shoes which water would not run under.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1122'>All fairies that were accustomed to turn mortals into cheese.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1123'>Every one of these, who might want to get in, were to be refused admittance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1124'>Another circle of rather exclusive fairies, who always kept away from the blacksmiths, hardware stores, smelting furnaces and mines, had formed an anti-iron society. These were a kind of a Welsh "Four Hundred," or lite, who would have nothing to do with anyone who had an iron tool, or weapon, or ornament in his hand, or on his dress, or who used iron in any form, or for any use. They frowned upon the idea of Cymric Land becoming rich by mining, and smelting, and selling iron. They did not even approve of the idea that any imps and dwarfs of the iron mines should be admitted to the meeting.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1125'>One clique of fairies, that looked like elves were in bad humor, almost to moping. When one of these got up to speak, it seemed as if he would never sit down. He tired all the lively fairies by long-winded reminiscences, of druids, and mistletoes, and by telling every one how much better the old times were than the present.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1126'>President Puck, who always liked things short, and was himself as lively as quicksilver, many times called these long-winded fellows to order; but they kept meandering on, until daybreak, when it was time to adjourn, lest the sunshine should spoil them all, and change them into slate or stone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1127'>It was hard to tell just how much business was disposed of, at this session, or whether one ever came to the point, although there was a great deal of oratory and music. Much of what was said was in poetry, or in verses, or rhymes, of three lines each. What they talked about was mainly in protest against the smoke of factories and collieries, and because there was so much soot, and so little soap, in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='colliery;factory;protest;smoke;soot;soap' adjectives='little;much' verbs='be;talk' valence='5.662' arousal='3.694' dominance='5.307'>the land</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1128'>But what did they do at <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='congress' adjectives='' verbs='do' valence='5.27' arousal='3.9975' dominance='5.64'>the fairy</entity> congress?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1129'>The truth is, that nobody to-day knows what was done in this session of the fairies, for the proceedings were kept secret. The only one who knows was an old Welshman whom the story-teller used to meet once in a while. He is the one mortal who knows anything about this meeting, and he won"t tell; or at least he won"t talk in anything but Welsh. So we have to find out the gist of the matter, by noticing, in the stories which we have just read what the fairies did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1130'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1131'>XXIV</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1132'>THE SWORD OF AVALON</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1133'>Many of the Welsh tales are about fighting and wars and no country as small as Wales has so many castles. Yet these are nearly all in ruins and children play in them. This is because men got tired of battles and sieges.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1134'>Everybody knows that after King Arthur"s knights had punched and speared, whacked and chopped at each other with axe and sword long enough, had slain dragons and tamed monsters, and rescued princesses from cruel uncles, and good men from dark dungeons, even the plain people, such as farmers and mechanics, had enough and wanted no more. Besides this, they wished to be treated more like human beings, and not have to work so hard and also to keep their money when they earned it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1135'>Even King Arthur himself, towards the end of this era, saw that fashions were changing and that he must change with them. Hardware was too high in price, and was no longer needed for clothing. He was wise enough to see that battle axes, maces, swords, lances and armor had better be put to some better use, when iron was getting scarce and wool and linen were cheaper. Even the stupid Normans learned that decency and kindness cost less, and accomplished more in making the Welshery loyal subjects of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kindness;cost;decency;subject' adjectives='loyal;stupid;less' verbs='make;accomplish;learn' valence='5.918' arousal='4.249' dominance='6.005'>the king</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1136'>So when, after many battles, King Arthur went out to have a little war of his own, and to enjoy the fight, in which he was mortally wounded, he showed his greatness, even in the hour of death. In truth, it is given to some men, like Samson, to be even mightier when they die, than when following the strenuous life. So it was with this great and good man of Cymry. His love for his people never ceased for one moment, and in his dying hour he left a bequest that all his people have understood and acted upon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1137'>Thus it has come to pass that the Welsh have been really unconquerable, by Saxon or Norman, or even in these twentieth century days by Teutons. Though living in a small country, they are among the greatest in the world, not in force, or in material things, but in soul. When <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fed;invader;ten;thousand;fugitive;battle;home' adjectives='sheltered' verbs='be;welcome;invade;stand' valence='5.0' arousal='4.27181818182' dominance='5.15818181818'>Belgium</entity> was invaded, they not only stood up in battle against the invader, but they welcomed to their homes tens of thousands of fugitives and fed and sheltered them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1138'>Brave as lions, their path of progress has been in faithfulness to duty, industry, and patience, and along the paths of poetry, music and brotherhood. Their motto for ages has been, "Truth against the World."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1139'>Now the manner of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;arthur;legacy;fashion;manner' adjectives='immortal' verbs='be;take' valence='5.8425' arousal='4.5275' dominance='5.315'>King</entity> Arthur"s taking off and his immortal legacy was on this fashion:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1140'>After doing a great many wonderful things, in many countries, King Arthur came back to punish the wicked man, Modred. In the battle that ensued, he received wounds that made him feel that he was very soon to die. So he ordered his loyal vassal to take his sword to the island of Avalon. There he must cast the weapon into the deep water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1141'>But the sword was part of the soul of Arthur. It would not sink out of sight, until it had given a message, from their king to the Welsh, for all time.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1142'>After it had been thrown in the water, it disappeared, but rose again. First the shining blade, and then the hilt, and then a hand was seen to rise out of the flood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1143'>Thrice that hand waved the sword round and round.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1144'>This was the prophecy of "the deathless from the dead." King Arthur"s body might be hid in a cave, or molder in the ground, but his soul was to live and cheer his people. His beloved Cymric nation, with their undying language, were to rise in power again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1145'>And the resurrection has been glorious. Not by the might of the soldier, or by arms or war--though the Welsh never flinch from duty, or before the foe--but by the power of poet, singer and the narrator of stories, that touch the imagination, and fire the soul to noble deeds, have these results come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1146'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='water;s;blade;spirit;sword' adjectives='veritable;good' verbs='become;wave' valence='5.885' arousal='4.426' dominance='5.624'>Arthur</entity>"s good blade, thus waved above the waters, became a veritable sword of the Spirit.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1147'>Men of genius arose to flush with color the old legends. Prophets, preachers, monks, missionaries carried these all over Europe, and made them the vehicles of Christian doctrine. In their new forms, they fired the imagination and illuminated, as with ten thousand lamps, many lands and nations, until they held every people in spell. In miracle and morality play, they reappeared in beauty. They attuned the harp and instrument of the musician and the troubadour, and these sang the gospel in all lands, north and south, while telling the stories of Adam, and of Abraham, of Bethlehem, and of the cross, of the Holy Grail, and of Arthur and his Knights. All the precious lore of the Celtic race became transfigured, to illustrate and enforce Christian truth. The symbolical bowl, the Celtic caldron of abundance, became the cup of the Eucharist and the Grail the symbol of blessings eternal.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1148'>By the artists, in the stained glass, and in windows of the great churches, which were built no longer of wood but of stone, that blossomed under the chisel, the old legends were, by the new currents of truth, given a mystic glow. As wonderful as the rise of Gothic architecture and the upbuilding of cathedrals, as glorious as the light and art, that beautify the great temples of worship, was this re-birth of the Arthurian legends.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1149'>For now, again, the old virtues of the knightly days--loyalty, obedience, redress of wrongs, reverence of womanhood, and the application of Christian ethics to the old rude rules of decency, lifted the life of the common people to a nobler plane and ushered in the modern days.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1150'>Then, after seven hundred years, a host of singers, Tennyson leading them all, attuned the old Celtic harp. They reset for us the Cymric melody and colorful incidents in "the light that never was on sea or land." The old days live again in a greater glory.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1151'>Lady Guest put the Mabinogion into English, and Renan, and Arnold, and Rolleston, and Rhys, in prose, competed in praise of the heritages from the old time. Popular education was diffused. The Welsh language rose again from the dead. Cardiff holds in pure white marble the most thrilling interpretation of Welsh history, in the twelve white marble statues of the great men of Wales. The Welsh people, by bloodless victory, have won the respect of all mankind.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1152'>They set a beacon for the oppressed nations. In the World War of 1914-1918, they helped to save freedom and civilization. They were in the van.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1153'>Long may the sword of Arthur wave!</paragraph>

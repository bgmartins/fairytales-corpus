	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='5'>All people in the world tell nursery tales to their children. The Japanese tell them, the Chinese, the Red Indians by their camp fires, the Eskimo in their dark dirty winter huts. The Kaffirs of South Africa tell them, and the modern Greeks, just as the old Egyptians did, when Moses had not been many years rescued out of the bulrushes. The Germans, French, Spanish, Italians, Danes, Highlanders tell them also, and the stories are apt to be like each other everywhere. A child who has read the Blue and Red and Yellow Fairy Books will find some old friends with new faces in the Pink Fairy Book, if he examines and compares. But the Japanese tales will probably be new to the young student; the Tanuki is a creature whose acquaintance he may not have made before. He may remark that Andersen wants to "point a moral," as well as to "adorn a tale; " that he is trying to make fun of the follies of mankind, as they exist in civilised countries. The Danish story of "The Princess in the Chest" need not be read to a very nervous child, as it rather borders on a ghost story. It has been altered, and is really much more horrid in the language of the Danes, who, as history tells us, were not a nervous or timid people. I am quite sure that this story is not true. The other Danish and Swedish stories are not alarming. They are translated by Mr. W. A. Craigie. Those from the Sicilian (through the German) are translated, like the African tales (through the French) and the Catalan tales, and the Japanese stories (the latter through the German), and an old French story, by Mrs. Lang. Miss Alma Alleyne did the stories from Andersen, out of the German. Mr. Ford, as usual, has drawn the monsters and mermaids, the princes and giants, and the beautiful princesses, who, the Editor thinks, are, if possible, prettier than ever. Here, then, are fancies brought from all quarters: we see that black, white, and yellow peoples are fond of just the same kinds of adventures. Courage, youth, beauty, kindness, have many trials, but they always win the battle; while witches, giants, unfriendly cruel people, are on the losing hand. So it ought to be, and so, on the whole, it is and will be; and that is all the moral of fairy tales. We cannot all be young, alas! and pretty, and strong; but nothing prevents us from being kind, and no kind man, woman, or beast or bird, ever comes to anything but good in these oldest fables of the world. So far all the tales are true, and no further.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='53'>Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty, with a skin as soft and shining as silk, and wise green eyes, that could see even in the dark. His name was Gon, and he belonged to a music teacher, who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='54'>Now not far from the music master"s house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma. She was such a little dear altogether, and blinked her eyes so daintily, and ate her supper so tidily, and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue, that her mistress was never tired of saying, "<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mistress;tongue;eye;nose;supper' adjectives='pink;such;little' verbs='be;finish;tire;do;blink;say;lick;have;eat' valence='5.8205' arousal='4.125' dominance='5.7225'>Koma</entity>, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mistress;tongue;eye;nose;supper' adjectives='pink;such;little' verbs='be;finish;tire;do;blink;say;lick;have;eat' valence='5.8205' arousal='4.125' dominance='5.7225'>Koma</entity>, what should I do without you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='55'>Well, it happened one day that these two, when out for an evening stroll, met under a cherry tree, and in one moment fell madly in love with each other. Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife, for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy; but he was not easy to please, and did not care about any of them. Now, before he had time to think, Cupid had entangled him in his net, and he was filled with love towards Koma. She fully returned his passion, but, like a woman, she saw the difficulties in the way, and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them. Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma, but her mistress would not part from her. Then the music master was asked to sell <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='master;music;suggestion;everything' adjectives='such' verbs='sell;be;decline;remain;ask;listen' valence='5.933' arousal='3.986' dominance='5.647'>Gon</entity> to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='master;music;suggestion;everything' adjectives='such' verbs='sell;be;decline;remain;ask;listen' valence='5.933' arousal='3.986' dominance='5.647'>the lady</entity>, but he declined to listen to any such suggestion, so everything remained as before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='56'>At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves, and to seek their fortunes together. So one moonlight night they stole away, and ventured out into an unknown world. All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine, till they had left their homes far behind them, and towards evening they found themselves in a large park. The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired, and the grass looked very soft and inviting, and the trees cast cool deep shadows, when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise, in the shape of a big, big dog! He came springing towards them showing all his teeth, and Koma shrieked, and rushed up a cherry tree. Gon, however, stood his ground boldly, and prepared to give battle, for he felt that Koma"s eyes were upon him, and that he must not run away. But, alas! his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him, for he was large and powerful, and very fierce. From her perch in the tree Koma saw it all, and screamed with all her might, hoping that some one would hear, and come to help. Luckily a servant of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='servant;mistress;dog;arm' adjectives='' verbs='be;belong;drive;walk;pick;carry;tremble' valence='5.76071428571' arousal='4.135' dominance='5.37142857143'>the princess</entity> to whom <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='servant;mistress;dog;arm' adjectives='' verbs='be;belong;drive;walk;pick;carry;tremble' valence='5.76071428571' arousal='4.135' dominance='5.37142857143'>the park</entity> belonged was walking by, and he drove off the dog, and picking up the trembling <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='servant;mistress;dog;arm' adjectives='' verbs='be;belong;drive;walk;pick;carry;tremble' valence='5.76071428571' arousal='4.135' dominance='5.37142857143'>Gon</entity> in his arms, carried him to his mistress.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='57'>So poor little Koma was left alone, while Gon was borne away full of trouble, not in the least knowing what to do. Even the attention paid him by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='use;attention;fate;way;beauty' adjectives='delighted' verbs='do;console;be;pay;fight;turn;see;wait' valence='6.11444444444' arousal='4.28611111111' dominance='5.74277777778'>the princess</entity>, who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways, did not console him, but there was no use in fighting against fate, and he could only wait and see what would turn up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='58'>The princess, Gon"s new mistress, was so good and kind that everybody loved her, and she would have led a happy life, had it not been for a serpent who had fallen in love with her, and was constantly annoying her by his presence. Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as he appeared; but as they were careless, and the serpent very sly, it sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them, and to frighten the princess by appearing before her. One day she was seated in her room, playing on her favourite musical instrument, when she felt something gliding up her sash, and saw her enemy making his way to kiss her cheek. She shrieked and threw herself backwards, and Gon, who had been curled up on a stool at her feet, understood her terror, and with one bound seized the snake by his neck. He gave him one bite and one shake, and flung him on the ground, where he lay, never to worry the princess any more. Then she took <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;world;bit;arm;mat' adjectives='nicest;softest' verbs='lie;praise;wish;see;caress;take;have;eat' valence='5.74411764706' arousal='3.98941176471' dominance='5.74823529412'>Gon</entity> in her arms, and praised and caressed him, and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat, and the softest mats to lie on; and he would have had nothing in the world to wish for if only he could have seen <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;world;bit;arm;mat' adjectives='nicest;softest' verbs='lie;praise;wish;see;caress;take;have;eat' valence='5.74411764706' arousal='3.98941176471' dominance='5.74823529412'>Koma</entity> again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>Time passed on, and one morning Gon lay before the house door, basking in the sun. He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him, and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and ill-treating quite a little one. He jumped up, full of rage, and chased away the big cat, and then he turned to comfort the little one, when his heart nearly burst with joy to find that it was Koma. At first Koma did not know him again, he had grown so large and stately; but when it dawned upon her who it was, her happiness knew no bounds. And they rubbed their heads and their noses again and again, while their purring might have been heard a mile off.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>Paw in paw they appeared before the princess, and told her the story of their life and its sorrows. The princess wept for sympathy, and promised that they should never more be parted, but should live with her to the end of their days. By-and-bye the princess herself got married, and brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park. And she told him all about her two cats, and how brave Gon had been, and how he had delivered her from her enemy the serpent.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='61'>And when the prince heard, he swore they should never leave them, but should go with the princess wherever she went. So it all fell out as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;end;friend;child' adjectives='many' verbs='be;wish;play;have;fall' valence='6.36' arousal='4.305' dominance='5.63333333333'>the princess</entity> wished; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;end;friend;child' adjectives='many' verbs='be;wish;play;have;fall' valence='6.36' arousal='4.305' dominance='5.63333333333'>Gon</entity> and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;end;friend;child' adjectives='many' verbs='be;wish;play;have;fall' valence='6.36' arousal='4.305' dominance='5.63333333333'>Koma</entity> had many children, and so had <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;end;friend;child' adjectives='many' verbs='be;wish;play;have;fall' valence='6.36' arousal='4.305' dominance='5.63333333333'>the princess</entity>, and they all played together, and were friends to the end of their lives.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>From Griechtsche und Albanesische Marchen, von J. G. von Hahn. (Leipzig: Engelmann. 1864.)</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not get on at all well together, for the younger was much handsomer than his elder brother who was very jealous of him. When they grew older, things became worse and worse, and at last one day as they were walking through a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other, tied him to a tree, and went on his way hoping that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='death;tree;youth;thing;wood;way;hold' adjectives='elder;other;worse;older' verbs='be;seize;starve;walk;tie;go;become;grow;hope' valence='5.65869565217' arousal='3.80086956522' dominance='5.29130434783'>the boy</entity> might starve to death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='66'>However, it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='prisoner;shepherd;flock;tree;son' adjectives='humpbacked;old' verbs='be;stop;say;see;pass;tie;happen;tell' valence='5.52176470588' arousal='3.90882352941' dominance='5.16647058824'>the tree</entity> with his flock, and seeing the prisoner, he stopped and said to him, "Tell me, my son why are you tied to that tree?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>"Because I was so crooked," answered the young man; "but it has quite cured me, and now my back is as straight as can be."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>"I wish you would bind me to a tree," exclaimed the shepherd, "so that my back would get straight."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>"With all the pleasure in life," replied the youth. "If you will loosen these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>This was soon done, and then the young man drove off the sheep, leaving their real shepherd to repent of his folly; and before he had gone very far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen, and he persuaded them to turn with him and to seek for adventures.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king"s ears, and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody. So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='72'>And when the young man stood before the king, the king spoke to him and said, "By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people, you have, in the eye of the law, forfeited your life. But on one condition I will spare you, and that is, if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon. Fail in this, and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>"If that is all," said the youth, "you shall soon have it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered. He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle, when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could. Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable, and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse, "What is the matter, my treasure? is anything hurting you?" After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse, but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise. But when the same thing happened the third time, the dragon lost his temper, and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating. This offended the horse and made him angry, and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head, he made no further fuss, but suffered himself to be led quietly away. Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off, calling over his shoulder, "Hi! dragon! dragon! if anyone asks you what has become of your horse, you can say that I have got him!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='75'>But the king said, "The flying horse is all very well, but I want something more. You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='dragon;piece;bell' adjectives='little' verbs='bring;hew;cover;have;lie' valence='5.492' arousal='4.18666666667' dominance='5.53066666667'>the bed</entity> of the dragon, or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>"Is that all?" answered the youth. "That is easily done."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>And when night came he went away to the dragon"s house and climbed up on to the roof. Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung, and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up. But the little bells all began to ring, and the dragon woke and said to his wife, "Wife, you have pulled off all the bed-clothes!" and drew the covering towards him, pulling, as he did so, the young man into the room. Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot, "To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him, and when I get back we will eat him together."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='78'>So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him. But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him, the prisoner caught her by the legs, threw her to the ground, seized her and speedily cut her throat, just as she had been about to do for him, and put her body in the oven. Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='carry;cover;snatch' valence='5.475' arousal='4.1125' dominance='5.355'>the king</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='79'>The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow. "That is not enough," said his majesty; "you must bring me the dragon himself, or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>"It shall be done," answered the youth; "but you must give me two years to manage it, for my beard must grow so that he may not know me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='81'>"So be it," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;say' valence='6.03' arousal='4.10333333333' dominance='5.97'>the king</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='82'>And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beggar;house;clothes;dragon;thing;s;garment;man;beard' adjectives='young' verbs='do;be;persuade;take;go;meet;grow;change' valence='5.65269230769' arousal='4.06384615385' dominance='5.42961538462'>the road</entity> to the dragon"s house and on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beggar;house;clothes;dragon;thing;s;garment;man;beard' adjectives='young' verbs='do;be;persuade;take;go;meet;grow;change' valence='5.65269230769' arousal='4.06384615385' dominance='5.42961538462'>the way</entity> he met a beggar, whom he persuaded to change clothes with him, and in the beggar"s garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>He found his enemy before his house, very busy making a box, and addressed him politely, "Good morning, your worship. Have you a morsel of bread?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>"You must wait," replied the dragon, "till I have finished my box, and then I will see if I can find one."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"What will you do with the box when it is made?" inquired the beggar.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>"It is for the young man who killed my wife, and stole my flying horse and my bed covering," said the dragon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>"He deserves nothing better," answered the beggar, "for it was an ill deed. Still that box is too small for him, for he is a big man."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>"You are wrong," said the dragon. "The box is large enough even for me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>"Well, the rogue is nearly as tall as you," replied the beggar, "and, of course, if you can get in, he can. But I am sure you would find it a tight fit."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>"No, there is plenty of room," said the dragon, tucking himself carefully inside.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>But no sooner was he well in, than the young man clapped on the lid and called out, "Now press hard, just to see if he will be able to get out."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>The dragon pressed as hard as he could, but the lid never moved.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>There was once a hard-working student who lived in an attic, and he had nothing in the world of his own. There was also a hard-working grocer who lived on the first floor, and he had the whole house for his own.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>The Goblin belonged to him, for every Christmas Eve there was waiting for him at the grocer"s a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the middle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>The grocer could afford this, so the Goblin stayed in the grocer"s shop; and this teaches us a good deal. One evening the student came in by the back door to buy a candle and some cheese; he had no one to send, so he came himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>He got what he wanted, paid for it, and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife (she was a woman who could do more than nod; she could talk).</paragraph>

You are a clever and practical man, but about poetry you understand as much as that old tub over there!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned, but the grocer laughed, and so did the student. It was only said in fun.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>When it was night and the shop was shut, and everyone was in bed except the student, the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocer"s wife"s tongue. She did not use it when she was asleep, and on whatever object in the room he put it that thing began to speak, and spoke out its thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged. But only one thing at a time could use it, and that was a good thing, or they would have all spoken together.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='115'>But how bright it was! Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='118'>The little fellow thought it over, for he was a sensible Goblin. Then he sighed, "The student has no jam!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='119'>And on that he went down to the grocer again. And it was a good thing that he did go back, for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue. It had read everything that was inside it, on the one side, and was just going to turn itself round and read from the other side when the Goblin came in and returned the tongue to its owner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='120'>But the whole shop, from the till down to the shavings, from that night changed their opinion of the tub, and they looked up to it, and had such faith in it that they were under the impression that when the grocer read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings, it all came from the tub.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly listening to the wisdom and intellect downstairs. No, as soon as the light shone in the evening from the attic it seemed to him as though its beams were strong ropes dragging him up, and he had to go and peep through the key-hole. There he felt the sort of feeling we have looking at the great rolling sea in a storm, and he burst into tears. He could not himself say why he wept, but in spite of his tears he felt quite happy. How beautiful it must be to sit under that tree with the student, but that he could not do; he had to content himself with the key-hole and be happy there!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='122'>There he stood out on the cold landing, the autumn wind blowing through the cracks of the floor.

She was lying in a splendid room furnished with royal splendour; the walls were covered with golden flowers on a green ground; the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet, and on a stool near by lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls. The maiden thought she must be dreaming, but in came three servants richly dressed, who asked what were her commands. "Go," said the maiden, "I will get up at once and cook the old man"s supper for him, and then I will feed the pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='208'>But the door opened and in came a handsome young man, who said, "I am a king"s son, and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man in this wood with no company but that of my three servants, who were transformed into a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow. The spell could only be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind not only to men but to beasts.

This son"s name was Uraschimataro, which means in Japanese, "Son of the island," and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman, minding neither wind nor weather. Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro, and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents, "If your son goes on being so rash, one day he will try his luck once too often, and the waves will end by swallowing him up."

But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks, there arose a fierce whirlwind, which shattered his boat to pieces, and she was sucked under by the waves. Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate. But he was a powerful swimmer, and struggled hard to reach the shore. Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him, and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said: "I am the turtle whose life you once saved. I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude. The land is still far distant, and without my help you would never get there. Climb on my back, and I will take you where you will." Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice, and thankfully accepted his friend"s help.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='219'>Uraschimataro agreed willingly, and in another moment they were deep, deep down, with fathoms of blue water above their heads. Oh, how quickly they darted through the still, warm sea! The young man held tight, and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel, but for three days they rushed on, till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace, shining with gold and silver, crystal and precious stones, and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='222'>Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him, that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next. But the turtle, who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him, went at once to make known his arrival. And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him, and she begged him to stay with her, and in return promised that he should never grow old, neither should his beauty fade. "Is not that reward enough?" she asked, smiling, looking all the while as fair as the sun itself. And Uraschimataro said "Yes," and so he stayed there. For how long? That he only knew later.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='223'>His life passed by, and each hour seemed happier than the last, when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents. He fought against it hard, knowing how it would grieve the princess, but it grew on him stronger and stronger, till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong. Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home, and that he must see his parents once more. The princess was almost frozen with horror, and implored him to stay with her, or something dreadful would be sure to happen. "You will never come back, and we shall meet again no more," she moaned bitterly. But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated, "Only this once will I leave you, and then will I return to your side for ever."

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='224'>"I will do anything that will bring me back to you," exclaimed Uraschimataro, looking at her tenderly, but the princess was silent: she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more. Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box, and gave it to Uraschimataro, praying him to keep it carefully, and above all things never to open it. "If you can do this," she said as she bade him farewell, "your friend the turtle will meet you at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='turtle;farewell;friend' adjectives='' verbs='carry;do;say;bid;meet' valence='5.49461538462' arousal='3.60153846154' dominance='5.87769230769'>the shore</entity>, and will carry you back to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='225'>Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart, and swore solemnly to do her bidding. He hid the box safely in his garments, seated himself on the back of the turtle, and vanished in the ocean path, waving his hand to the princess. Three days and three nights they swam through the sea, and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home. The turtle bade him farewell, and was gone in a moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='226'>Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps. He saw the smoke curling through the roof, and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted. He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='227'>Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='228'>Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street, hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='229'>In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess. Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true. He might be the victim of some enchanter"s spell, and in his hand lay the counter-charm. Almost unconsciously he opened it, and a purple vapour came pouring out. He held the empty box in his hand, and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled, like the hand of an old, old man. He ran to the brook, which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain. and saw himself reflected as in a mirror. It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him. Wounded to death, he crept back through the village, and no man knew the old, old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before. So he toiled wearily back, till he reached the shore, and here he sat sadly on a rock, and called loudly on the turtle. But she never came back any more, but instead, death came soon, and set him free.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='233'>Near a big river, and between two high mountains, a man and his wife lived in a cottage a long, long time ago. A dense forest lay all round the cottage, and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood. In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare, and many an hour the two passed together, when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='dinner;hare;friend;wanderings' adjectives='many' verbs='be;make;rest;have;pass;eat' valence='6.008125' arousal='3.77125' dominance='5.688125'>the man</entity> was resting by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='dinner;hare;friend;wanderings' adjectives='many' verbs='be;make;rest;have;pass;eat' valence='6.008125' arousal='3.77125' dominance='5.688125'>the roadside</entity>, eating his dinner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='234'>Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki, a wicked, quarrelsome beast, who hated the peasant, and was never tired of doing him an ill turn.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='235'>So for many days the man lay hidden, waiting for the Tanuki to come by, and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal, the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly, so that he could not move. Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house, feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns. "He shall pay for them with his skin," he said to his wife. "We will first kill him, and then cook him." So saying, he hanged the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fire;beam;head;wood;downward' adjectives='' verbs='go;say;gather;hang' valence='5.16272727273' arousal='4.49909090909' dominance='5.45272727273'>Tanuki</entity>, head downwards, to a beam, and went out to gather wood for a fire.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='236'>Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight. Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner, and, stopping her work, she looked round to see what it was. That was all that the rascal wanted, and he put on directly his most humble air, and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds, which her hurting him sorely. She was filled with pity for him, but did not dare to set him free, as she knew that her husband would be very angry. The Tanuki, however, did not despair, and seeing that her heart was softened, began his prayers anew. "He only asked to have his bonds taken from him," he said. "He would give his word not to attempt to escape, and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her." "Then you can have a little rest," he went on, "for rice pounding is very tiring work, and not at all fit for weak women." These last words melted the good woman completely, and she unfastened the bonds that held him. Poor foolish creature! In one moment the Tanuki had seized her, stripped off all her clothes, and popped her in the mortar. In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice; and not content with that, the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='flesh;pot;wife;content;dinner;peasant;rice' adjectives='ready;own;fine' verbs='cook;be;make;pound;place' valence='5.81578947368' arousal='3.98315789474' dominance='5.56105263158'>Tanuki</entity> placed a pot on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='flesh;pot;wife;content;dinner;peasant;rice' adjectives='ready;own;fine' verbs='cook;be;make;pound;place' valence='5.81578947368' arousal='3.98315789474' dominance='5.56105263158'>the hearth</entity> and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='237'>When everything was complete he looked out of the door, and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood. Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman"s clothes, but, as he was a magician, assumed her form as well. Then he took the wood, kindled the fire, and very soon set a large dinner before the old man, who was very hungry, and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy. But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner, he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape. Then he said to the peasant, "You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them! You are caught in your own net. It is your own wife that you have eaten, and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor." With these words he turned and made for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='word' adjectives='' verbs='turn;make' valence='5.9975' arousal='3.8975' dominance='6.0075'>the forest</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='238'>The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened, and seemed frozen to the place where he stood. When he had recovered himself a little, he collected the bones of his dead wife, buried them in the garden, and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki. After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly, and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='239'>While he was thus weeping and wailing his friend the hare passed by, and, hearing the noise, pricked up his ears and soon recognised the old man"s voice. He wondered what had happened, and put his head in at the door and asked if anything was the matter. With tears and groans the peasant told him the whole dreadful story, and the hare, filled with anger and compassion, comforted him as best he could, and promised to help him in his revenge. "The false knave shall not go unpunished," said he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='240'>So the first thing he did was to search the house for materials to make an ointment, which he sprinkled plentifully with pepper and then put in his pocket. Next he took a hatchet, bade farewell to the old man, and departed to the forest. He bent his steps to the dwelling of the Tanuki and knocked at the door. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plot;hare;hold;cause;hatchet' adjectives='pleased' verbs='be;begin;get;notice;see;suspect;lay;have' valence='5.73571428571' arousal='3.85785714286' dominance='5.40928571429'>Tanuki</entity>, who had no cause to suspect the hare, was greatly pleased to see him, for he noticed the hatchet at once, and began to lay plots how to get hold of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='241'>To do this he thought he had better offer to accompany the hare, which was exactly what the hare wished and expected, for he knew all the Tanuki"s cunning, and understood his little ways. So he accepted the rascal"s company with joy, and made himself very pleasant as they strolled along. When they were wandering in this manner through the forest the hare carelessly raised his hatchet in passing, and cut down some thick boughs that were hanging over the path, but at length, after cutting down a good big tree, which cost him many hard blows, he declared that it was too heavy for him to carry home, and he must just leave it where it was. This delighted the greedy Tanuki, who said that they would be no weight for him, so they collected the large branches, which the hare bound tightly on his back. Then he trotted gaily to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hare;bundle' adjectives='lighter' verbs='follow;trot' valence='5.87' arousal='3.806' dominance='5.406'>the house</entity>, the hare following after with his lighter bundle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='242'>By this time the hare had decided what he would do, and as soon as they arrived, he quietly set on fire the wood on the back of the Tanuki. The Tanuki, who was busy with something else, observed nothing, and only called out to ask what was the meaning of the crackling that he heard. "It is just the rattle of the stones which are rolling down the side of the mountain," the hare said; and the Tanuki was content, and made no further remarks, never noticing that the noise really sprang from the burning boughs on his back, until his fur was in flames, and it was almost too late to put it out. Shrieking with pain, he let fall the burning wood from his back, and stamped and howled with agony. But the hare comforted him, and told him that he always carried with him an excellent plaster in case of need, which would bring him instant relief, and taking out his ointment he spread it on a leaf of bamboo, and laid it on the wound. No sooner did it touch him than the Tanuki leapt yelling into the air, and the hare laughed, and ran to tell his friend the peasant what a trick he had played on their enemy. But the old man shook his head sadly, for he knew that the villain was only crushed for the moment, and that he would shortly be revenging himself upon them. No, the only way every to get any peace and quiet was to render the Tanuki harmless for ever. Long did the old man and the hare puzzle together how this was to be done, and at last they decided that they would make two boats, a small one of wood and a large one of clay. Then they fell to work at once, and when the boats were ready and properly painted, the hare went to the Tanuki, who was still very ill, and invited him to a great fish-catching. The Tanuki was still feeling angry with the hare about the trick he had played him, but he was weak and very hungry, so he gladly accepted the proposal, and accompanied the hare to the bank of the river, where the two boats were moored, rocked by the waves. They both looked exactly alike, and the Tanuki only saw that one was bigger than the other, and would hold more fish, so he sprang into the large one, while the hare climbed into the one which was made of wood. They loosened their moorings, and made for the middle of the stream, and when they were at some distance from the bank, the hare took his oar, and struck such a heavy blow at the other boat, that it broke in two. The Tanuki fell straight into the water, and was held there by the hare till he was quite dead. Then he put the body in his boat and rowed to land, and told the old man that his enemy was dead at last. And the old man rejoiced that his wife was avenged, and he took the hare into his house, and they lived together all their days in peace and quietness upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wife;quietness;house;hare;peace;man' adjectives='old' verbs='be;live;rejoice;take;avenge' valence='6.15461538462' arousal='4.36153846154' dominance='5.84461538462'>the mountain</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='318'>"Bow-wow!" barked the yard-dog, and walked three times round himself, and then crept into his kennel to sleep. The weather really did change. Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood; later on came an icy wind, which sent the frost packing. But when the sun rose, it was a glorious sight. The trees and shrubs were covered with rime, and looked like a wood of coral, and every branch was thick with long white blossoms. The most delicate twigs, which are lost among the foliage in summer-time, came now into prominence, and it was like a spider"s web of glistening white. The lady-birches waved in the wind; and when the sun shone, everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust, and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='319'>"Isn"t it wonderful?" exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden. They stopped near the Snow-man, and looked at the glistening trees. "Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight," she said, with her eyes shining.</paragraph>

My mistress used to nurse me, and kiss and fondle me, and call me her dear, sweet little Alice! But by-and-by I grew too big, and I was given to the housekeeper, and I went into the kitchen. You can see into it from where you are standing; you can look at the room in which I was master, for so I was when I was with the housekeeper. Of course it was a smaller place than upstairs, but it was more comfortable, for I wasn"t chased about and teased by the children as I had been before. My food was just as good, or even better. I had my own pillow, and there was a stove there, which at this time of year is the most beautiful thing in the world. I used to creep right under that stove. Ah me! I often dream of that stove still! Bow-wow!"</paragraph>

But they were very angry, and from that time I have been chained here, and I have lost my voice. Don"t you hear how hoarse I am? Bow-wow! I can"t speak like other dogs. Bow-wow!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>Time passed, and the shirt-collar came in a rag-bag to the paper-mill. There was a large assortment of rags, the fine ones in one heap, and the coarse ones in another, as they should be.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>"I have had a terrible number of love affairs!" he said. "They give me no peace. I was such a fine gentleman, so stiff with starch!

She threw herself into a wash-tub for my sake! Then there was a widow, who glowed with love for me. But I left her alone, till she became black. Then there was the dancer, who inflicted the wound which has caused me to be here now; she was very violent! My own hair-brush was in love with me, and lost all her hair in consequence. Yes, I have experienced much in that line; but I grieve most of all for the garter,-I mean, the girdle, who threw herself into a wash-tub. I have much on my conscience; it is high time for me to become white paper!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='388'>And so he did! he became white paper, the very paper on which this story is printed. And that was because he had boasted so terribly about things which were not true. We should take this to heart, so that it may not happen to us, for we cannot indeed tell if we may not some day come to the rag-bag, and be made into white paper, on which will be printed our whole history, even the most secret parts, so that we too go about the world relating it, like the shirt-collar.</paragraph>

The king then promised a large reward to the soldier who would volunteer for the post. This did for some time, as there were found a few reckless fellows, who wished to earn this good payment. But they never got it, for in the morning, they too had disappeared like the rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='410'>So it had gone on for something like a whole year; every night a sentinel had been placed beside the chest, either by compulsion or of his own free will, but not a single one of the sentinels was to be seen, either on the following day or any time thereafter. And so it had also gone with one, on the night before a certain day, when a merry young smith came wandering to the town where the king"s castle stood. It was the capital of the country, and people of every king came to it to get work. This smith, whose name was Christian, had come for that same purpose. There was no work for him in the place he belonged to, and he wanted now to seek a place in the capital.</paragraph>

It was too well known how all the sentinels disappeared, who were set on that post, and all that they had got hold of had refused with thanks. These sat down beside Christian, and ordered drinks, and drank along with him. Now Christian was a merry fellow who liked good company; he could both drink and sing, and talk and boast as well, when he got a little drop in his head. He told these under-officers that he was one of that kind of folk who never are afraid of anything.

But neither did anyone know what had become of all the sentinels. The thought of this ran in his head so much, after the wine was out of it, that he searched about everywhere for a way of escape, and finally, at eleven o"clock, he found a little postern in the steeple which was not locked, and out at this he crept, intending to run away.</paragraph>

When the clock struck one, the appearance had to go back into the chest again, and Christian heard the lid slam after it. After this there was dead silence in the church.

The king immediately got out of bed, and laid the hundred dollars for him on the table, and then wanted to question him. "Have you seen anything?" said he. "Have you seen my daughter?" "I have stood at my post," said the young smith, "and that is quite enough; I undertook nothing more." He was not sure whether he dared tell what he had seen and heard, and besides he was also a little conceited because he had done what no other man had been able to do, or had had courage for. The king professed to be quite satisfied, and asked him whether he would engage himself to stand on guard again the following night. "No, thank you," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='more' verbs='say;thank;have' valence='5.972' arousal='3.836' dominance='6.22'>Christian</entity>, "I will have no more of that!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='423'>"As you please," said the king, "you have behaved like a brave fellow, and now you shall have your breakfast. You must be needing something to strengthen you after that turn."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='424'>The king had breakfast laid for him, and sat down at the table with him in person; he kept constantly filling his glass for him and praising him, and drinking his health. Christian needed no pressing, but did full justice both to the food and drink, and not least to the latter. Finally he grew bold, and said that if <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sentry;man' adjectives='bold' verbs='be;say;stand;grow;give' valence='6.17214285714' arousal='3.955' dominance='5.60714285714'>the king</entity> would give him two hundred dollars for it, he was his man to stand sentry next night as well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='425'>When this was arranged, Christian bade him "Good-day," and went down among the guards, and then out into the town along with other soldiers and under-officers. He had his pocket full of money, and treated them, and drank with them and boasted and made game of the good-for-nothings who were afraid to stand on guard, because they were frightened that the dead princess would eat them. See whether she had eaten him! So the day passed in mirth and glee, but when eight o"clock came, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mirth;glee;o;clock' adjectives='' verbs='be;shut;come;pass' valence='5.49454545455' arousal='3.93363636364' dominance='5.38636363636'>Christian</entity> was again shut up in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mirth;glee;o;clock' adjectives='' verbs='be;shut;come;pass' valence='5.49454545455' arousal='3.93363636364' dominance='5.38636363636'>the church</entity>, all alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='426'>Before he had been there two hours, he got tired of it, and thought only of getting away. He found a little door behind the altar which was not locked, and at ten o"clock he slipped out at it, and took to his heels and made for the beach. He had got half-way thither, when all at once the same little man stood in front of him and said, "Good evening, Christian, where are you going?" "I"ve leave to go where I please," said the smith, but at the same time he noticed that he could not move a foot. "No, you have undertaken to keep guard to-night as well," said the little man, "and you must attend to that." He then took hold of him, and however unwilling he was, Christian had to go with him right back to the same little door that he had crept out at. When they got there, the little man said to him, "Go in front of the altar now, and take in your hand the book that is lying there. There you shall stay till you hear the lid of the chest slam down over the dead. In that way you will come to no harm."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='427'>With that the little man shoved him in at the door, and locked it. Christian then immediately went in front of the altar, and took the book in his hand, and stood thus until the clock struck twelve, and the appearance sprang out of the chest. "Sentry, where are you? Sentry, where are you?" it shrieked, and then rushed to the pulpit, and right up into it. But there was no one there that night. Then it howled and shrieked again,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='431'>At the same moment, it noticed the smith standing in front of the altar, and came rushing towards him. "Are you there?" it screamed; "now I"ll catch you." But it could not come up over the step in front of the altar, and there it continued to howl, and scream, and threaten, until the clock struck one, when it had to go into the chest again, and Christian heard the lid slam above it. That night, however, it had not the same appearance as on the previous one; it was less ugly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='432'>When all was quiet in the church, the smith lay down before the altar and slept calmly till the following morning, when the colonel came to fetch him. He was taken up to the king again, and things went on as the day before. He got his money, but would give no explanation whether he had seen the king"s daughter, and he would not take the post again, he said. But after he had got a good breakfast, and tasted well of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='guard;s;half;post;breakfast;wine' adjectives='dangerous;good;less' verbs='do;have;get;taste;say;promise;undertake;go;be;agree' valence='5.84653846154' arousal='4.16961538462' dominance='5.71269230769'>the king</entity>"s wines, he undertook to go on guard again the third night, but he would not do it for less than the half of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='guard;s;half;post;breakfast;wine' adjectives='dangerous;good;less' verbs='do;have;get;taste;say;promise;undertake;go;be;agree' valence='5.84653846154' arousal='4.16961538462' dominance='5.71269230769'>the kingdom</entity>, he said, for it was a dangerous post, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='guard;s;half;post;breakfast;wine' adjectives='dangerous;good;less' verbs='do;have;get;taste;say;promise;undertake;go;be;agree' valence='5.84653846154' arousal='4.16961538462' dominance='5.71269230769'>the king</entity> had to agree, and promise him this.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='433'>The remainder of the day went like the previous one. He played the boastful soldier, and the merry smith, and he had comrades and boon-companions in plenty. At eight o"clock he had to put on his uniform again, and was shut up in the church. He had not been there for an hour before he had come to his senses, and thought, "It"s best to stop now, while the game is going well." The third night, he was sure, would be the worst; he had been drunk when he promised it, and the half of the kingdom, the king could never have been in earnest about that! So he decided to leave, without waiting so long as on the previous nights. In that way he would escape the little man who had watched him before. All the doors and posterns were locked, but he finally though of creeping up to a window, and opening that, and as the clock struck nine, he crept out there. It was fairly high in the wall, but he got to the ground with no bones broken, and started to run. He got down to the shore without meeting anyone, and there he got into a boat, and pushed off from land. He laughed immensely to himself at the thought of how cleverly he had managed and how he had cheated the little man. Just then he heard a voice from the shore, "Good evening, Christian, where are you going?" He gave no answer. "To-night your legs will be too short," he thought, and pulled at the oars. But he then felt something lay hold of the boat, and drag it straight in to shore, for all that he sat and struggled with the oars.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='436'>"You must go in there, and you shall go in there," said the little man, and with that he lifted him up on to the window-sill. Then he said to him: "Notice well now what you have to do. This evening you must stretch yourself out on the left-hand side of her chest. The lid opens to the right, and she comes out to the left. When she has got out of the chest and passed over you, you must get into it and lie there, and that in a hurry, without her seeing you. There you must remain lying until day dawns, and whether she threatens you or entreats you, you must not come out of it, or give her any answer. Then she has no power over you, and both you and she are freed."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>The smith then had to go in at the window, just as he came out, and went and laid himself all his length on the left side of the princess"s chest, close up to it, and there he lay stiff as a rock until the clock struck twelve. Then the lid sprang up to the right, and the princess came out, straight over him, and rushed round the church, howling and shrieking "Sentry, where are you? Sentry, where are you?" She went towards the altar, and right up to it, but there was no one there; then she screamed again,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='446'>Then the smith heard in the church a soft music, which grew louder and louder, and soon filled the whole building. He heard also a multitude of footsteps, as if the church was being filled with people. He heard the priest go through the service in front of the altar, and there was singing more beautiful than he had ever heard before. Then he also heard the priest offer up a prayer of thanksgiving because the land had been freed from war and pestilence, and from all misfortune, and the king"s daughter delivered from the evil one. Many voices joined in, and a hymn of praise was sung; then he heard the priest again, and heard his own name and that of the princess, and thought that he was being wedded to her. The church was packed full, but he could see nothing. Then he heard again the many footsteps as ol" folk leaving the church, while the music sounded fainter and fainter, until it altogether died away. When it was silent, the light of day began to break in through the windows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='447'>The smith sprang up out of the chest and fell on his knees and thanked God. The church was empty, but up in front of the altar lay the princess, white and red, like a human being, but sobbing and crying, and shaking with cold in her white shroud. The smith took his sentry coat and wrapped it round her; then she dried her tears, and took his hand and thanked him, and said that he had now freed her from all the sorcery that had been in her from her birth, and which had come over her again when her father broke the command against seeing her until she had completed her fourteenth year.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='448'>She said further, that if he who had delivered her would take her in marriage, she would be his.

Now the father loved his three sons equally, so that he could not make up his mind which of them should have the house after his death, because he did not wish to favour any one more than the others. And he did not want to sell the house, because it had belonged to his family for generations; otherwise he could have divided the money equally amongst them. At last an idea struck him, and he said to his sons: "You must all go out into the world, and look about you, and each learn a trade, and then, when you return, whoever can produce the best masterpiece shall have <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='world;trade;idea;masterpiece;son' adjectives='last;best' verbs='return;look;go;say;produce;have;learn;strike' valence='6.04473684211' arousal='4.25842105263' dominance='5.71894736842'>the house</entity>."</paragraph>

The blacksmith had to shoe the king"s horses, and thought to himself, "Without doubt the house will be yours!" The barber shaved the best men in the kingdom, and he, too, made sure that the house would be his. The fencing-master received many a blow, but he set his teeth, and would not allow himself to be troubled by them, for he thought to himself, "If you are afraid of a blow you will never get <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='blow;tooth' adjectives='many;afraid;fencing-master' verbs='be;set;get;receive;allow;trouble;think' valence='5.58529411765' arousal='4.00176470588' dominance='5.45058823529'>the house</entity>."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='670'>There was once a pretty little fir-tree in a wood. It was in a capital position, for it could get sun, and there was enough air, and all around grew many tall companions, both pines and firs. It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air, or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries. Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw; they would sit down by the little fir-tree and say, "What a pretty little one this is!" <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='do' valence='6.81333333333' arousal='3.58' dominance='6.08333333333'>The tree</entity> did not like that at all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='671'>By the next year it had grown a whole ring taller, and the year after that another ring more, for you can always tell a fir-tree"s age from its rings.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='672'>"Oh! if I were only a great tree like the others!" sighed the little fir-tree, "then I could stretch out my branches far and wide and look out into the great world! The birds would build their nests in my branches, and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others!" It took no pleasure in the sunshine, nor in the birds, nor in the rose-coloured clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset. Then the winter came, and the snow lay white and sparkling all around, and a hare would come and spring right over the little fir-tree, which annoyed it very much. But when two more winters had passed the fir-tree was so tall that the hare had to run round it. "Ah! to grow and grow, and become great and old! that is the only pleasure in life," thought the tree. In the autumn the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees; this happened every year, and the young fir-tree would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground, their branches hewn off, and the great trunks left bare, so that they were almost unrecognisable. But then they were laid on waggons and dragged out of the wood by horses. "Where are they going? What will happen to them?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='673'>In spring, when the swallows and storks came, the fir-tree asked them, "Do you know where they were taken? Have you met them?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='679'>Towards Christmas-time quite little trees were cut down, some not as big as the young fir-tree, or just the same age, and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='680'>"Whither are those going?" asked the fir-tree; "they are no bigger than I, and one there was much smaller even! Why do they keep their branches? Where are they taken to?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='681'>"We know! we know!" twittered the sparrows. "Down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows, we know where they go!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='684'>"Am I too destined to the same brilliant career?" wondered the fir-tree excitedly. "That is even better than sailing over the sea! I am sick with longing. If it were only Christmas! Now I am tall and grown-up like those which were taken away last year. Ah, if I were only in the cart! If I were only in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence! And then? Then comes something better, something still more beautiful, else why should they dress us up? There must be something greater, something grander to come--but what? Oh! I am pining away! I really don"t know what"s the matter with me!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='685'>"Rejoice in us," said the air and sunshine, "rejoice in your fresh youth in the free air!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='686'>But it took no notice, and just grew and grew; there it stood fresh and green in winter and summer, and all who saw it said, "What a beautiful tree!" And at Christmas-time it was the first to be cut down. The axe went deep into the pith; the tree fell to the ground with a groan; it felt bruised and faint. It could not think of happiness, it was sad at leaving its home, the spot where it had sprung up; it knew, too, that it would never see again its dear old companions, or the little shrubs and flowers, perhaps not even the birds. Altogether the parting was not pleasant.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='688'>Then came two footmen in livery and carried the fir-tree to a large and beautiful room. There were pictures hanging on the walls, and near the Dutch stove stood great Chinese vases with lions on their lids; there were armchairs, silk-covered sofas, big tables laden with picture-books and toys, worth hundreds of pounds-at least, so the children said. The fir-tree was placed in a great tub filled with sand, but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet. How the tree trembled! What was coming now? On its branches they hung little nets cut out of coloured paper, each full of sugarplums; gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing, over a hundred red, blue, and white tapers were fastened among the branches. Dolls as life-like as human beings--the fir-tree had never seen any before were suspended among the green, and right up at the top was fixed a gold tinsel star; it was gorgeous, quite unusually gorgeous!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='689'>"To-night," they all said, "to-night it will be lighted!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='690'>"Ah!" thought the tree, "if it were only evening! Then the tapers would soon be lighted. What will happen then? I wonder whether the trees will come from the wood to see me, or if the sparrows will fly against the window panes? Am I to stand here decked out thus through winter and summer?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='691'>It was not a bad guess, but the fir-tree had real bark-ache from sheer longing, and bark-ache in trees is just as bad as head-ache in human beings.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='692'>Now the tapers were lighted. What a glitter! What splendour! The tree quivered in all its branches so much, that one of the candles caught the green, and singed it. "Take care!" cried the young ladies, and they extinguished it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='693'>Now the tree did not even dare to quiver. It was really terrible! It was so afraid of losing any of its ornaments, and it was quite bewildered by all the radiance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='694'>And then the folding doors were opened, and a crowd of children rushed in, as though they wanted to knock down the whole tree, whilst the older people followed soberly.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='695'>"What are they doing?" thought the tree. "What is going to happen?" And the tapers burnt low on the branches, and were put out one by one, and then the children were given permission to plunder the tree. They rushed at it so that all its boughs creaked; if it had not been fastened by the gold star at the top to the ceiling, it would have been overthrown.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='696'>The children danced about with their splendid toys, and no one looked at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='toy;apple;bough;fig;child;nurse' adjectives='old;splendid' verbs='be;look;dance;see;have;peep;come;forget' valence='5.82736842105' arousal='4.09631578947' dominance='5.55263157895'>the tree</entity>, except the old nurse, who came and peeped amongst the boughs, just to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='697'>"A story! a story!" cried the children, and dragged a little stout man to the tree; he sat down beneath it, saying, "Here we are in the greenwood, and the tree will be delighted to listen!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='698'>"Henny Penny!" cried some; "Humpty Dumpty!" cried others; there was a perfect babel of voices! Only the fir-tree kept silent, and thought, "Am I not to be in it? Am I to have nothing to do with it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='699'>But it had already been in it, and played out its part. And the man told them about Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs and married a princess. The children clapped their hands and cried, "Another! another!" They wanted the story of Henny Penny also, but they only got Humpty Dumpty. The fir-tree stood quite astonished and thoughtful; the birds in the wood had never related anything like that. "Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs and yet married a princess! yes, that is the way of the world!" thought the tree, and was sure it must be true, because such a nice man had told the story. "Well, who knows? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs and marry a princess." And it rejoiced to think that next day it would be decked out again with candles, toys, glittering ornaments, and fruits. "To-morrow I shall quiver again with excitement. I shall enjoy to the full all my splendour. To-morrow I shall hear Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Henny Penny too." And <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='silent' verbs='think;stand;lose' valence='5.66166666667' arousal='3.63666666667' dominance='5.55333333333'>the tree</entity> stood silent and lost in thought all through the night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='700'>Next morning the servants came in. "Now the dressing up will begin again," thought the tree. But they dragged it out of the room, and up the stairs to the lumber-room, and put it in a dark corner, where no ray of light could penetrate. "What does this mean?" thought the tree. "What am I to do here? What is there for me to hear?" And it leant against the wall, and thought and thought. And there was time enough for that, for days and nights went by, and no one came; at last when some one did come, it was only to put some great boxes into the corner. Now <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;seem;cover;forget;have' valence='5.79714285714' arousal='3.49714285714' dominance='5.16428571429'>the tree</entity> was quite covered; it seemed as if it had been quite forgotten.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='701'>"Now it is winter out-doors," thought the fir-tree. "The ground is hard and covered with snow, they can"t plant me yet, and that is why I am staying here under cover till the spring comes. How thoughtful they are!

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='702'>"Squeak, squeak!" said a little mouse, stealing out, followed by a second. They sniffed at the fir-tree, and then crept between its boughs.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='704'>"Where do you come from?" asked the mice, "and what do you know?" They were extremely inquisitive. "Do tell us about the most beautiful place in the world.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='705'>"I know nothing about that," said the tree. "But I know the wood, where the sun shines, and the birds sing." And then it told them all about its young days, and the little mice had never heard anything like that before, and they listened with all their ears, and said: "Oh, how much you have seen! How lucky you have been!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='706'>"I?" said the fir-tree, and then it thought over what it had told them. "Yes, on the whole those were very happy times." But then it went on to tell them about Christmas Eve, when it had been adorned with sweet-meats and tapers.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='709'>"How beautifully you tell stories!" said the little mice. And next evening they came with four others, who wanted to hear the tree"s story, and it told still more, for it remembered everything so clearly and thought: "Those were happy times!

And then it thought of a pretty little birch-tree that grew out in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='birch-tree;fir-tree;princess' adjectives='real;beautiful;little' verbs='seem;think;grow' valence='6.25769230769' arousal='4.31153846154' dominance='5.59923076923'>the wood</entity>, and seemed to the fir-tree a real princess, and a very beautiful one too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='710'>"Who is Humpty Dumpty?" asked the little mice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='711'>And then the tree told the whole story; it could remember every single word, and the little mice were ready to leap on to the topmost branch out of sheer joy! Next night many more mice came, and on Sunday even two rats; but they did not care about the story, and that troubled the little mice, for now they thought less of it too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='712'>"Is that the only story you know?" asked the rats.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='713'>"The only one," answered the tree. "I heard that on my happiest evening, but I did not realise then how happy I was."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='731'>In a village there once lived a smith called Basmus, who was in a very poor way. He was still a young man, and a strong handsome fellow to boot, but he had many little children and there was little to be earned by his trade. He was, however, a diligent and hard-working man, and when he had no work in the smithy he was out at sea fishing, or gathering wreckage on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='smithy;work;fishing;sea;wreckage;man' adjectives='hard-working;diligent' verbs='be;gather;have' valence='5.68545454545' arousal='4.01909090909' dominance='5.63090909091'>the shore</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='732'>It happened one time that he had gone out to fish in good weather, all alone in a little boat, but he did not come home that day, nor the following one, so that all believed he had perished out at sea. On the third day, however, Basmus came to shore again and had his boat full of fish, so big and fat that no one had ever seen their like. There was nothing the matter with him, and he complained neither of hunger or thirst. He had got into a fog, he said, and could not find land again. What he did not tell, however, was where he had been all the time; that only came out six years later, when people got to know that he had been caught by a mermaid out on the deep sea, and had been her guest during the three days that he was missing. From that time forth he went out no more to fish; nor, indeed, did he require to do so, for whenever he went down to the shore it never failed that some wreckage was washed up, and in it all kinds of valuable things. In those days everyone took what they found and got leave to keep it, so that the smith grew more prosperous day by day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='733'>When seven years had passed since the smith went out to sea, it happened one morning, as he stood in the smithy, mending a plough, that a handsome young lad came in to him and said, "Good-day, father; my mother <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='smithy;lad;father;smith;greeting;plough;sea;mother' adjectives='long;young;good-day;handsome' verbs='send;keep;mend;say;stand;have;pass;go;happen;come' valence='5.9565625' arousal='3.9565625' dominance='5.656875'>the mermaid</entity> sends her greetings, and says that she has had me for six years now, and you can keep me for as long."</paragraph>

The smith then had to collect all the iron he had, and Hans held it while his father forged for him a staff, which was heavier than the anvil.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='751'>All this was agreed to, and the squire took Hans into the kitchen, and told the servant girls that the new man was to have as much food as the other twelve.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='752'>It was in the evening that Hans arrived there, so he did nothing more that day than eat his supper--a big pot of buck-wheat porridge, which he cleaned to the bottom and was then so far satisfied that he said he could sleep on that, so he went off to bed. He slept both well and long, and all the rest were up and at their work while he was still sleeping soundly. The squire was also on foot, for he was curious to see how the new man would behave who was both to eat and work for twelve.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='753'>But as yet there was no <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sun;heaven;squire' adjectives='high' verbs='go;be;see;call' valence='6.217' arousal='3.879' dominance='5.444'>Hans</entity> to be seen, and the sun was already high in the heavens, so the squire himself went and called on him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='754'>"Get up, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;cry;sleep;get' valence='5.6775' arousal='4.0375' dominance='4.7525'>Hans</entity>," he cried; "you are sleeping too long."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='755'>Hans woke up and rubbed his eyes. "Yes, that"s true," he said, "I must get up and have my breakfast."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='756'>So he rose and dressed himself, and went into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='porridge;pot;work' adjectives='' verbs='be;get;rise;ask;have;go;swallow;dress' valence='5.96083333333' arousal='3.7875' dominance='5.8'>the kitchen</entity>, where he got his pot of porridge; he swallowed all of this, and then asked what work he was to have.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='757'>He was to thresh that day, said the squire; the other twelve men were already busy at it. There were twelve threshing-floors, and the twelve men were at work on six of them--two on each. Hans must thresh by himself all that was lying upon the other six floors. He went out to the barn and got hold of a flail. Then he looked to see how the others did it and did the same, but at hte first stroke he smashed the flail in pieces. There were several flails hanging there, and Hans took the one after the other, but they all went the same way, every one flying in splinters at the first stroke. He then looked round for something else to work with, and found a pair of strong beams lying near. Next he caught sight of a horse-hide nailed up on the barn-door. With the beams he made a flail, using the skin to tie them together. The one beam he used as a handle, and the other to strike with, and now that was all right. But the barn was too low, there was no room to swing the flail, and the floors were too small. Hans, however, found a remedy for this--he simply lifted the whole roof off the barn, and set it down in the field beside. He then emptied down all the corn that he could lay his hands on and threshed away. He went through one lot after another, and it was ll the same to him what he got hold of, so before midday he had threshed all the squire"s grain, his rye and wheat and barley and oats, all mixed through each other. When he was finished with this, he lifted <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lid;box;job;squire;barn' adjectives='' verbs='be;finish;set;do;lift;go;tell' valence='5.59882352941' arousal='3.85235294118' dominance='5.65705882353'>the roof</entity> up on the barn again, like setting a lid on a box, and went in and told the squire that the job was done.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='758'>The squire opened his eyes at this announcement; and came out to see if it was really true. It was true, sure enough, but he was scarcely delighted with the mixed grain that he got from all his crops. However, when he saw the flail that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='flail;thing;room;anything;fellow' adjectives='good;afraid;strong' verbs='be;use;clean;get;make;learn;say;see;thresh;have;swing;dare' valence='5.83913043478' arousal='3.96' dominance='5.60956521739'>Hans</entity> had used, and learned how he had made room for himself to swing it, he was so afraid of the strong fellow, that he dared not say anything, except that it was a good thing he had got it threshed; but it had still to be cleaned.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='759'>"What does that mean?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.95' arousal='3.48' dominance='6.29'>Hans</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='760'>It was explained to him that the corn and the chaff had to be separated; as yet both were lying in one heap, right up to the roof. Hans began to take up a little and sift it in his hands, but he soon saw that this would never do. He soon thought of a plan, however; he opened both barn-doors, and then lay down at one end and blew, so that all the chaff flew out and lay like a sand-bank at the other end of the barn, and the grain was as clean as it could be. Then he reported to the squire that that job also was done. The squire said that that was well; there was nothing more for him to do that day. Off went <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nap;supper-time' adjectives='much' verbs='go;take;last;eat;get' valence='5.96888888889' arousal='4.28666666667' dominance='5.56666666667'>Hans</entity> to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nap;supper-time' adjectives='much' verbs='go;take;last;eat;get' valence='5.96888888889' arousal='4.28666666667' dominance='5.56666666667'>the kitchen</entity>, and got as much as he could eat; then he went and took a midday nap which lasted till supper-time.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='761'>Meanwhile the squire was quite miserable, and made his moan to his wife, saying that she must help him to find some means to getting rid of this strong fellow, for he durst not give him his leave. She sent for the steward, and it was arranged that next day all the men should go to the forest for fire-wood, and that they should make a bargain among them, that the one who came home last with his load should be hanged. They thought they could easily manage that it would be Hans who would lose his life, for the others would be early on the road, while Hans would certainly oversleep himself. In the evening, therefore, the men sat and talked together, saying that next morning they must set out early to the forest, and as they had a hard day"s work and a long journey before them, they would, for their amusement, make a compact, that whichever of them came home last with his load should lose his life on the gallows. So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='objection' adjectives='' verbs='make;have' valence='5.26' arousal='3.89' dominance='5.38666666667'>Hans</entity> had no objections to make.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='762'>Long before the sun was up next morning, all the twelve men were on foot. They took all the best horses and carts, and drove off to the forest. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='squire' adjectives='' verbs='let;say;sleep;lay;lie' valence='5.38666666667' arousal='3.78833333333' dominance='5.72'>Hans</entity>, however, lay and slept on, and the squire said, "Just let him lie."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='763'>At last, Hans thought it was time to have his breakfast, so he got up and put on his clothes. He took plenty of time to his breakfast, and then went out to get his horse and cart ready. The others had taken everything that was any good, so that he had a difficulty in scraping together four wheels of different sizes and fixing them to an old cart, and he could find no other horses than a pair of old hacks. He did not know where it lay, but he followed the track of the other carts, and in that way came to it all right. On coming to the gate leading into the forest, he was unfortunate enough to break it in pieces, so he took a huge stone that was lying on the field, seven ells long, and seven ells broad, and set this in the gap, then he went on and joined the others. These laughed at him heartily, for they had laboured as hard as they could since daybreak, and had helped each other to fell trees and put them on the carts, so that all of these were now loaded except one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='764'>Hans got hold of a woodman"s axe and proceeded to fell a tree, but he destroyed the edge and broke the shaft at the first blow. He therefore laid down the axe, put his arms round the tree, and pulled it up by the roots. This he threw upon his cart, and then another and another, and thus he went on while all the others forgot their work, and stood with open mouths, gazing at this strange woodcraft. All at once they began to hurry; the last cart was loaded, and they whipped up their horses, so as to be the first to arrive home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='765'>When Hans had finished his work, he again put his old hacks into the cart, but they could not move it from the spot. He was annoyed at this, and took them out again, twisted a rope round the cart, and all the trees, lifted the whole affair on his back, and set off home, leading the horses behind him by the rein. When he reached <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;gap;cart;row' adjectives='further;unable;whole' verbs='lay;get;reach;find;stand' valence='5.37333333333' arousal='3.52916666667' dominance='5.74583333333'>the gate</entity>, he found the whole row of carts standing there, unable to get any further for the stone which lay in the gap.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='766'>"What!" said Hans, "can twelve men not move that stone?" With that he lifted it and threw it out of hte way, and went on with his burden on his back, and the horses behind him, and arrived at the farm long before any of the others. The squire was walking about there, looking and looking, for he was very curious to know what had happened. Finally, he caught sight of Hans coming along in this fashion, and was so frightened that he did not know what to do, but he shut the gate and put on the bar. When Hans reached the gate of the courtyard, he laid down the trees and hammered at it, but no one came to open it. He then took the trees and tossed them over the barn into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wheel;direction;tree;cart;barn' adjectives='different' verbs='fly;toss;take' valence='5.72363636364' arousal='3.90727272727' dominance='5.69363636364'>the yard</entity>, and the cart after them, so that every wheel flew off in a different direction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='767'>When the squire saw this, he thought to himself, "The horses will come the same way if I don"t open <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;squire;t;way' adjectives='same' verbs='do;don;open;see;come;think' valence='5.4575' arousal='3.88666666667' dominance='5.63083333333'>the door</entity>," so he did this.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='768'>"Good day, master," said Hans, and put the horses into the stable, and went into the kitchen, to get something to eat. At length the other men came home with their loads. When they came in, Hans said to them, "Do you remember the bargain we made last night? Which of you is it that"s going to be hanged?" "Oh," said they, "that was only a joke; it didn"t mean anything." "Oh well, it doesn"t matter, "said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='matter;t' adjectives='' verbs='be;say;doesn' valence='5.7275' arousal='4.2275' dominance='5.875'>Hans</entity>, and there was no more about it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='769'>The squire, however, and his wife and the steward, had much to say to each other about the terrible man they had got, and all were agreed that they must get rid of him in some way or other. The steward said that he would manage this all right. Next morning they were to clean the well, and they would use of that opportunity. They would get him down into the well, and then have a big mill-stone ready to throw down on top of him--that would settle him. After that they could just fill in the well, and then escape being at any expense for his funeral. Both the squire and his wife thought this a splendid idea, and went about rejoicing at the thought that now they would get rid of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thought;squire;idea;wife' adjectives='rid;splendid' verbs='go;rejoice;think;get' valence='6.14083333333' arousal='4.3175' dominance='5.85833333333'>Hans</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='770'>But Hans was hard to kill, as we shall see. He slept long next morning, as he always did, and finally, as he would not waken by himself, the squire had to go and call him. "Get up, Hans, you are sleeping too long," he cried. Hans woke up and rubbed his eyes. "That"s so," said he, "I shall rise and have my breakfast." He got up then and dressed himself, while the breakfast stood waiting for him. When he had finished the whole of this, he asked what he was to do that day. He was told to help the other men to clean out the well. That was all right, and he went out and found the other men waiting for him. To these he said that they could choose whichever task they liked--either to go down into the well and fill the buckets while he pulled them up, or pull them up, and he alone would go down to the bottom of the well.

It was with the greatest difficulty that they got it thrown down there, and now they had no doubt that he had got all that he wanted. But the stone happened to fall so luckily that his head went right through the hole in the middle of the mill-stone, so that it sat round his neck like a priest"s collar. At this, Hans would stay down no longer. He came out of the well, with the mill-stone round his neck, ad went straight to the squire and complained that the other men were trying to make a fool of him. He would not be their priest, he said; he had too little learning for that. Saying this, he bent down his head and shook the stone off, so that it crushed one of the squire"s big toes.</paragraph>

Perhaps he had only gone astray, and he would advertise him at church next Sunday, and find out where anyone had seen him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='848'>When the king noticed that neither of his sons returned, although a long time had passed since the second one set out, he was greatly distressed, for not only had he lost all hope of getting back his sight, but he had also lost his two eldest sons. The youngest now came to him, and offered to go in search of his brothers and to bring the bird Grip; he was quite certain that he would succeed in this. The king was unwilling to risk his third son on such an errand, but he begged so long that his father had at last to consent. This prince also was fitted out in the finest manner, like his brothers, and so rode away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='849'>He also turned into the same inn as his brothers, and when these saw him they assailed him with many entreaties to remain with them and share their merry life. But he answered that now, when he had found them, his next task was to get the bird Grip, for which his blind father was longing, and so he had not a single hour to spare with them in the inn. He then said farewell to his brothers, and rode on to find another inn in which to pass the night. When he had ridden a long way, and it began to grow dark, he came to a house which lay deep in the forest. Here he was received in a very friendly manner by the host, who put his horse into the stable, and led the prince himself into the guest-chamber, where he ordered a maid-servant to lay the cloth and set down the supper. It was now dark, and while the girl was laying the cloth and setting down the dishes, and the prince had begun to appease his hunger, he heard the most piteous shrieks and cries from the next room. He sprang up from the table and asked the girl what those cries were, and whether he had fallen into a den of robbers. The girl answered that these shrieks were heard every night, but it was no living being who uttered them; it was a dead man, who life the host had taken because he could not pay for the meals he had had in the inn. The host further refused to bury the dead man, as he had left nothing to pay the expenses of the funeral, and every night he went and scourged the dead body of his victim.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='850'>When she had said this she lifted the cover off one of the dishes, and the prince saw that there lay on it a knife and an axe. He understood then that the host meant to ask him by this what kind of death he preferred to die, unless he was willing to ransom his life with his money. He then summoned the host, gave him a large sum for his own life, and paid the dead man"s debt as well, besides paying him for burying the body, which the murderer now promised to attend to.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='851'>The prince, however, felt that his life was not safe in this murderer"s den, and asked the maid to help him to escape that night. She replied that the attempt to do so might cost her her own life, as the key of the stable in which the prince"s horse stood lay under the host"s pillow; but, as she herself was a prisoner there, she would help him to escape if he would take her along with him.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='852'>As he now rode all alone through a forest there met him a fox, who greeted him in a friendly fashion, and asked him where he was going, and on what errand he was bent. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everyone;errand' adjectives='important' verbs='answer;be;meet;confide' valence='5.9625' arousal='3.96875' dominance='5.77375'>The prince</entity> answered that his errand was too important to be confided to everyone that he met.</paragraph>

When they had traversed the forest together they saw the castle at some distance. Then the fox gave the prince three grains of gold, one of which he was to throw into the guard-room, another into the room where the bird Grip sat, and the third into its cage. He could then take the bird, but he must beware of stroking it; otherwise it would go ill with him.</paragraph>

When the prince got the beautiful bird into his hand he could not resist the temptation to stroke it, whereupon it awoke and began to scream.

The fox said that he had come to assist him, but he could do no more than advise the prince, when he was brought up for trial, to answer "yes" to all the judge"s questions, and everything would go well. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='judge;grip;instruction;bird;master-thief' adjectives='' verbs='be;answer;say;have;ask;follow;steal;mean' valence='5.04375' arousal='4.090625' dominance='5.1675'>The prince</entity> faithfully followed his instructions, so that when the judge asked him whether he had meant to steal the bird Grip he said "Yes," and when the judge asked him if he was a master-thief he again answered "Yes."</paragraph>

The prince went into the castle, and did with the grains of gold as the fox had told him, so that sleep fell upon everyone there; but when he had taken the princess into his arms he forgot the fox"s warning, at the sight of her beauty, and kissed her.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1400'>Then the two brothers put on their armour, buckled their swords, and pocketed their purees; and, after taking a tender farewell of each other, they mounted their horses and went their various ways.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1401'>The elder brother rode straight on till he reached the borders of a strange kingdom. He crossed the frontier, and soon found himself on the banks of a river; and before him, in the middle of the stream, a beautiful girl sat chained to a rock and weeping bitterly. For in this river dwelt a serpent with seven heads, who threatened to lay waste the whole land by breathing fire and flame from his nostrils unless the king sent him every morning a man for his breakfast. This had gone on so long that now there were no men left, and he had been obliged to send his own daughter instead, and the poor girl was waiting till the monster got hungry and felt inclined to eat her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1414'>What could the poor girl do? This time there was no knight to come to her aid.

"I will go to the fig-tree," he said to himself, "to see whether he is alive or dead." So he rode through the forest till he came where the fig-tree stood, and cut a slit in the bark, and waited. In a moment a little gurgling noise was heard, and out came a stream of blood, running fast. "Ah, woe is me!" he cried bitterly. "My brother is dead or dying! Shall I ever reach him in time to save his life?" Then, leaping on his horse, he shouted, "Now, my steed, fly like the wind!" and they rode right through the world, till one day they came to the town where the young man and his wife lived. Here the princess had been sitting every day since the morning that her husband had left her, weeping bitter tears, and listening for his footsteps. And when she saw his brother ride under the balcony she mistook him for her own husband, for they were so alike that no man might tell the difference, and her heart bounded, and, leaning down, she called to him, "At last! at last! how long have I waited for thee!" When the younger brother heard these words he said to himself, "So it was here that my brother lived, and this beautiful woman is my sister-in-law," but he kept silence, and let her believe he was indeed her husband. Full of joy, the princess led him to the old king, who welcomed him as his own son, and ordered a feast to be made for him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1616'>The bargain was made, and the lad went home with the man to whom he had engaged himself.

The latter was a great troll, and had marvellous power over both men and beasts.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1617'>Next day the lad had to begin his service. The first thing that the troll set him to was to feed all the wild animals from the forest.

He was the only animal that was left in the wood now, for the troll had tied up all the others, and every hunter in the whole country was eager to knock him over. But in this they met with no success; there was no dog that could overtake him, and no marksman that could hit him. They shot and shot at him, and he ran and ran. It was an unquiet life, but in the long run he got used to it, when he saw that there was no danger in it, and it even amused him to befool all the hunters and dogs that were so eager after him.</paragraph>

This was delightful, the lad thought; he could go even faster now than when he was a hare, and the dogs could not come after him here. This was a great delight to him, but he soon found out that he was not to be left quite at peace, for all the marksmen and hunters who saw him aimed at him and fired away, for they had no other birds to shoot at than himself, as the troll had tied up all the others.</paragraph>

At last he came to a glass palace, which stood at the bottom of the sea. He could see into all the rooms and halls, where everything was very grand; all the furniture was of white ivory, inlaid with gold and pearl. There were soft rugs and cushions of all the colours of the rainbow, and beautiful carpets that looked like the finest moss, and flowers and trees with curiously crooked branches, both green and yellow, white and red, and there were also little fountains which sprang up from the most beautiful snail-shells, and fell into bright mussel-shells, and at the same time made a most delightful music, which filled the whole palace.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1630'>One day the girl said to him that now it was close on the time when he must become a fish again--the troll would soon call him home, and he would have to go, but before that he must put on the shape of the fish, otherwise he could not pass through the sea alive. Before this, while he was staying down there, she had told him that she was a daughter of the same troll whom the youth served, and he had shut her up there to keep her away from everyone. She had now devised a plan by which they could perhaps succeed in getting to see each other again, and spending the rest of their lives together. But there was much to attend to, and he must give careful heed to all that she told him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1631'>She told him then that all the kings in the country round about were in debt to her father the troll, and the king of a certain kingdom, the name of which she told him, was the first who had to pay, and if he could not do so at the time appointed he would lose his head. "And he cannot pay," said she; "I know that for certain. Now you must, first of all, give up your service with my father; the three years are past, and you are at liberty to go. You will go off with your six bushels of money, to the kingdom that I have told you of, and there enter the service of the king. When the time comes near for his debt becoming due you will be able to notice by his manner that he is ill at ease. You shall then say to him that you know well enough what it is that is weighing upon him--that it is the debt which he owes to the troll and cannot pay, but that you can lend him the money. The amount is six bushels--just what you have. You shall, however, only lend them to him on condition that you may accompany him when he goes to make the payment, and that you then have permission to run before him as a fool. When you arrive at the troll"s abode, you must perform all kinds of foolish tricks, and see that you break a whole lot of his windows, and do all other damage that you can. My father will then get very angry, and as the king must answer for what his fool does he will sentence him, even although he has paid his debt, either to answer three questions or to lose his life. The first question my father will ask will be, "Where is my daughter?" Then you shall step forward and answer "She is at the bottom of the sea." He will then ask you whether you can recognise her, and to this you will answer "Yes." Then he will bring forward a whole troop of women, and cause them to pass before you, in order that you may pick out the one that you take for his daughter. You will not be able to recognise me at all, and therefore I will catch hold of you as I go past, so that you can notice it, and you must then make haste to catch me and hold me fast. You have then answered his first question. His next question will be, "Where is my heart?" You shall then step forward again and answer, "It is in a fish." "Do you know that fish?" he will say, and you will again answer "Yes." He will then cause all kinds of fish to come before you, and you shall choose between them. I shall take good care to keep by your side, and when the right fish comes I will give you a little push, and with that you will seize the fish and cut it up. Then all will be over with the troll; he will ask no more questions, and we shall be free to wed."</paragraph>

He went about all day in despair, and thought and thought, but he could not remember what they sounded like. During the night he could not sleep, until towards morning he fell into a slumber, and all at once it flashed upon him what the troll used to say. He made haste to repeat the words, and at the same moment he became a fish again and slipped out into the sea.

However, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='prime;ditto;anybody;idea;minister;council' adjectives='new;excellent' verbs='do;name;form;be;contradict;call;know;have;carry;think' valence='5.95473684211' arousal='4.04315789474' dominance='5.78736842105'>the fairy</entity> did not think of that, but, carried away by her new ideas, she hastily formed a Council, and named as Prime Minister the excellent "Ditto," so called because he had never been known to contradict anybody.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1819'>No sooner was the revolt put down than the Council turned their attention to the question of the young king"s marriage. Various princesses were proposed to him, and the fairy, who was anxious to get the affair over before she left the Court for ever, gave it as her opinion that the Princess Diaphana would make the most suitable wife. Accordingly envoys were sent to bring back an exact report of the princess"s looks and ways, and they returned saying that she was tall and well made, but so very light that the equerries who accompanied her in her walks had to be always watching her, lest she should suddenly be blown away. This had happened so often that her subjects lived in terror of losing her altogether, and tried everything they could think of to keep her to the ground. They even suggested that she should carry weights in her pockets, or have them tied to her ankles; but this idea was given up, as the princess found it so uncomfortable. At length it was decided that she was never to go out in a wind, and in order to make matters surer still the equerries each held the end of a string which was fastened to her waist.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1820'>The Council talked over this report for some days, and then the king made up his mind that he would judge for himself, and pretend to be his own ambassador.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1822'>When the king arrived at Diaphana"s Court he found a magnificent reception awaiting him, for, though they pretended not to know who he was, secrets like this are never hidden. Now the young king had a great dislike to long ceremonies, so he proposed that his second interview with the princess should take place in the garden. The princess made some difficulties, but, as the weather was lovely and very still, she at last consented to the king"s wishes. But no sooner had they finished their first bows and curtseys than a slight breeze sprung up, and began to sway the princess, whose equerries had retired out of respect. The king went forward to steady her, but the wind that he caused only drove her further away from him. He rushed after her exclaiming, "O princess! are you really running away from me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1823'>"Good gracious, no!" she replied. "Run a little quicker and you will be able to stop me, and I shall be for ever grateful. That is what comes of talking in a garden," she added in disgust; "as if one wasn"t much better in a room that was tightly closed all round."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1824'>The king ran as fast as he could, but the wind ran faster still, and in a moment the princess was whirled to the bottom of the garden, which was bounded by a ditch.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1825'>By this time the whole court were running over the plain, some on foot and some on horseback, all hurrying to the help of their princess, who really was in some danger, for the wind was rising to the force of a gale. The king looked on for a little, and then returned with his attendants to the palace, reflecting all the while on the extreme lightness of his proposed bride and the absurdity of having a wife that rose in the air better than any kite. He thought on the whole that it would be wiser not to wait longer, but to depart at once, and he started on horseback at the very moment when the princess had been found by her followers, wet to the skin, and blown against a rick. Souci met the carriage which was bringing her home, and stopped to congratulate her on her escape, and to advise her to put on dry clothes. Then he continued his journey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1826'>It took a good while for the king to get home again, and he was rather cross at having had so much trouble for nothing. Besides which, his courtiers made fun at his adventure, and he did not like being laughed at, though of course they did not dare to do it before his face. And the end of it was that very soon he started on his travels again, only allowing one equerry to accompany him, and even this attendant he managed to lose the moment he had left his own kingdom behind him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='1827'>Now it was the custom in those days for princes and princesses to be brought up by fairies, who loved them as their own children, and did not mind what inconvenience they put other people to for their sakes, for all the world as if they had been real mothers. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;spite;point;country;mind;manners;man;care' adjectives='awkward;nicer;young;most;likely;much;lovely' verbs='be;marry;live;have;touch;meet;make;improve' valence='6.27892857143' arousal='4.15821428571' dominance='5.84535714286'>The fairy Aveline</entity>, who lived in a country that touched at one point <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='king;spite;point;country;mind;manners;man;care' adjectives='awkward;nicer;young;most;likely;much;lovely' verbs='be;marry;live;have;touch;meet;make;improve' valence='6.27892857143' arousal='4.15821428571' dominance='5.84535714286'>the kingdom</entity> of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;spite;point;country;mind;manners;man;care' adjectives='awkward;nicer;young;most;likely;much;lovely' verbs='be;marry;live;have;touch;meet;make;improve' valence='6.27892857143' arousal='4.15821428571' dominance='5.84535714286'>King Souci</entity>, had under her care the lovely <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;spite;point;country;mind;manners;man;care' adjectives='awkward;nicer;young;most;likely;much;lovely' verbs='be;marry;live;have;touch;meet;make;improve' valence='6.27892857143' arousal='4.15821428571' dominance='5.84535714286'>Princess Minon-Minette</entity>, and had made up her mind to marry her to the young king, who, in spite of his awkward manners, which could be improved, was really very much nicer than most of the young men she was likely to meet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1828'>So Aveline made her preparations accordingly, and began by arranging that the equerry should lose himself in the forest, after which she took away the king"s sword and his horse while he lay asleep under a tree. Her reason for this was that she felt persuaded that, finding himself suddenly alone and robbed of everything, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='power;everything;reason;birth;pleasing;man' adjectives='real;better;other' verbs='be;hide;feel;rob;persuade;have;fall;find' valence='5.72217391304' arousal='4.05869565217' dominance='5.51391304348'>the king</entity> would hide his real birth, and would have to fall back on his powers of pleasing, like other men, which would be much better for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1829'>When the king awoke and found that the tree to which he had tied his horse had its lowest branch broken, and that nothing living was in sight, he was much dismayed, and sought high and low for his lost treasure, but all in vain. After a time he began to get hungry, so he decided that he had better try to find his way out of the forest, and perhaps he might have a chance of getting something to eat. He had only gone a few steps when he met Aveline, who had taken the shape of an old woman with a heavy bundle of faggots on her back. She staggered along the path and almost fell at his feet, and Souci, afraid that she might have hurt herself, picked her up and set her on her feet again before passing on his way. But he was not to be let off so easy.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1839'>"But I can"t do anything," he said, "except carry a bundle, and I shan"t earn much by that."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1840'>"Oh, you are learning," replied the old woman, "and it isn"t bad for a first lesson." But the king was paying very little attention to her, for he was rather cross and very tired. Indeed, he felt that he really could not carry the bundle any further, and was about to lay it down when up came a young maiden more beautiful than the day, and covered with precious stones. She ran to them, exclaiming to the old woman,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1841'>"Oh, you poor thing! I was just coming after you to see if I could help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1842'>"Here is a young man," replied the old woman, "who will be quite ready to give you up the bundle. You see he does not look as if he enjoyed carrying it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1843'>"Will you let me take it, sir?" she asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1844'>But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='temper;presence' adjectives='better;ashamed' verbs='feel;put;hold' valence='5.35666666667' arousal='4.64333333333' dominance='5.35666666667'>the king</entity> felt ashamed of himself, and held on to it tightly, while the presence of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='temper;presence' adjectives='better;ashamed' verbs='feel;put;hold' valence='5.35666666667' arousal='4.64333333333' dominance='5.35666666667'>the princess</entity> put him in a better temper.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1845'>So they all travelled together till they arrived at a very ordinary-looking house, which Aveline pointed out as the castle of the White Demon, and told the king that he might put down his bundle in the courtyard. The young man was terribly afraid of being recognised by someone in this strange position, and would have turned on his heel and gone away had it not been for the thought of Minon-Minette. Still, he felt very awkward and lonely, for both the princess and the old woman had entered the castle without taking the slightest notice of the young man, who remained where he was for some time, not quite knowing what he had better do. At length a servant arrived and led him up into a beautiful room filled with people, who were either playing on musical instruments or talking in a lively manner, which astonished <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='room;people;attention;instrument;length;manner;playing' adjectives='servant;beautiful;pleased;musical;lively' verbs='be;lead;pay;stand;listen;astonish;want;arrive;talk;fill' valence='6.0836' arousal='4.3148' dominance='5.7764'>the king</entity>, who stood silently listening, and not at all pleased at the want of attention paid him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1846'>Matters went on this way for some time. Every day the king fell more and more in love with Minon-Minette, and every day the princess seemed more and more taken up with other people.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1847'>He found her spinning in an underground chamber, but quite ready to tell him all he wanted to know. In answer to his questions he learned that in order to win the hand of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='accomplishment;talent;people;nobody;question;order;answer;hand;prince' adjectives='enough;faithful;happy' verbs='be;help;prove;win;marry;bear;have;learn;make' valence='6.5' arousal='4.33416666667' dominance='5.97875'>the princess</entity> it was not enough to be born a prince, for she would marry nobody who had not proved himself faithful, and had, besides, all those talents and accomplishments which help to make people happy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1848'>For a moment Souci was very much cast down on hearing this, but then he plucked up. "Tell me what I must do in order to win the heart of the princess, and no matter how hard it is I will do it. And show me how I can repay you for your kindness, and you shall have anything I can give you. Shall I bring in your bundle of faggots every day?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1849'>"It is enough that you should have made the offer," replied the old woman; and she added, holding out a skein of thread, "Take this; one day you will be thankful for it, and when it becomes useless your difficulties will be past."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1850'>"Is it the skein of my life?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1851'>"It is the skein of your love"s ill-luck," she said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1852'>And he took it and went away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1853'>Now the fairy Girouette, who had brought up Souci, had an old friend called Grimace, the protectress of Prince Fluet. Grimace often talked over the young prince"s affairs with Girouette, and, when she decided that he was old enough to govern his own kingdom, consulted Girouette as to a suitable wife. Girouette, who never stopped to think or to make inquiries, drew such a delightful picture of Minon-Minette that Grimace determined to spare no pains to bring about the marriage, and accordingly Fluet was presented at court. But though the young man was pleasant and handsome, the princess thought him rather womanish in some ways, and displayed her opinion so openly as to draw upon herself and Aveline the anger of the fairy, who declared that Minon-Minette should never know happiness till she had found a bridge without an arch and a bird without feathers. So saying, she also went away.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1855'>After crossing several deserts the king arrived at length in a country that seemed inhabited, but the instant he stepped over the border he was seized and flung into chains, and dragged at once to the capital.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1856'>The young man was led into the presence of the Iron <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='throne;death;presence;relation;iron;hall;man' adjectives='token;black;young' verbs='be;lead;hang;seat;mourn;have;put' valence='5.12652173913' arousal='4.02695652174' dominance='5.24739130435'>King</entity>, who was seated on a black throne in a hall also hung with black, as a token of mourning for all the relations whom he had put to death.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1859'>"Do you dare to insult me in my own court?" cried the king. "Away with him to Little Ease!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1860'>Now Little Ease was an iron cage hung by four thick chains in the middle of a great vaulted hall, and the prisoner inside could neither sit, nor stand, nor lie; and, besides that, he was made to suffer by turns unbearable heat and cold, while a hundred heavy bolts kept everything safe. Girouette, whose business it was to see after Souci, had forgotten his existence in the excitement of some new idea, and he would not have been alive long to trouble anybody if Aveline had not come to the rescue and whispered in his ear, "And the skein of thread?" He took it up obediently, though he did not see how it would help him but he tied it round one of the iron bars of his cage, which seemed the only thing he could do, and gave a pull. To his surprise the bar gave way at once, and he found he could break it into a thousand pieces. After this it did not take him long to get out of his cage, or to treat the closely barred windows of the hall in the same manner. But even after he had done all this freedom appeared as far from him as ever, for between him and the open country was a high wall, and so smooth that not even a monkey could climb it. Then Souci"s heart died within him. He saw nothing for it but to submit to some horrible death, but he determined that the Iron King should not profit more than he could help, and flung his precious thread into the air, saying, as he did so, "O fairy, my misfortunes are greater than your power. I am grateful for your goodwill, but take back your gift!" The fairy had pity on his youth and want of faith, and took care that one end of the thread remained in his hand. He suddenly felt a jerk, and saw that the thread must have caught on something, and this thought filled him with the daring that is born of despair. "Better," he said to himself, "trust to a thread than to the mercies of a king;" and, gliding down, he found himself safe on the other side of the wall. Then he rolled up the thread and put it carefully into his pocket, breathing silent thanks to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pocket;breathing;thanks;thread' adjectives='silent' verbs='put;roll' valence='5.93714285714' arousal='4.06142857143' dominance='6.08714285714'>the fairy</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1861'>Now Minon-Minette had been kept informed by Aveline of the prince"s adventures, and when she heard of the way in which he had been treated by the Iron King she became furious, and began to prepare for war. She made her plans with all the secrecy she could, but when great armies are collected people are apt to suspect a storm is brewing, and of course it is very difficult to keep anything hidden from fairy godmothers.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1862'>Up to this time Aveline had been able to put a stop to many of Grimace"s spiteful tricks, and to keep guard over Minon-Minette, but she had no power over anything that happened at a distance; and when the princess declared her intention of putting herself at the head of her army, and began to train herself to bear fatigue by hunting daily, the fairy entreated her to be careful never to cross the borders of her dominions without Aveline to protect her. The princess at once gave her promise, and all went well for some days. Unluckily one morning, as Minon-Minette was cantering slowly on her beautiful white horse, thinking a great deal about Souci and not at all of the boundaries of her kingdom (of which, indeed, she was very ignorant), she suddenly found herself in front of a house made entirely of dead leaves, which somehow brought all sorts of unpleasant things into her head. She remembered Aveline"s warning, and tried to turn her horse, but it stood as still as if it had been marble. Then the princess felt that she was slowly, and against her will, being dragged to the ground. She shrieked, and clung tightly to the saddle, but it was all in vain; she longed to fly, but something outside herself proved too strong for her, and she was forced to take <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='house;something;dead;saddle' adjectives='vain;strong;outside' verbs='fly;be;force;lead;prove;long;leave;take;cling;shriek' valence='5.23866666667' arousal='4.168' dominance='5.06066666667'>the path</entity> that led to the House of Dead Leaves.</paragraph>

Things won"t turn out exactly as you fancied. What you have got to do now is to go on your knees to the king and crave his pardon, and before he consents to a peace you will have to implore him to grant you the favour of becoming his wife. Meanwhile you will have to be my servant."</paragraph>

Besides which, she had no food but a little black bread, and no bed but a little straw. Out of pure spite she was sent in the heat of the day to look after the geese, and would most likely have got a sunstroke if she had not happened to pick up in the fields a large fan, with which she sheltered her face. To be sure, a fan seems rather an odd possession for a goose girl, but the princess did not think of that, and she forgot all her troubles when, on opening the fan to use it as a parasol, out tumbled a letter from her lover.

"If she is not on the earth," said Souci to himself, "perhaps she is hiding somewhere in the air. It is there that I shall find her." So, by the help of his thread, he tried to mount upwards, but he could go such a little way, and hurt himself dreadfully when he tumbled back to earth again.

His new wife had an only daughter, who was both ugly and untidy, whereas her stepdaughter was a beautiful girl, and was known as Maiden Bright-eye. Her stepmother was very cruel to her on this account; she had always to do the hardest work, and got very little to eat, and no attention paid to her; but to her own daughter she was all that was good. She was spared from all the hardest of the housework, and had always the prettiest clothes to wear.</paragraph>

When the brother learned what had happened he was greatly distressed, and did not know what to do. He could not bring himself to tell the truth about what had happened, nor did he expect that the king would believe it. In the long run he decided to hold on his way, and let things go as they liked. What he had expected happened--the king received his sister and wedded her at once, but repented it after the first night, as he could scarcely put down his foot in the morning for all the toads that were about the room, and when he saw her real face he was so enraged against the brother that he had him thrown into a pit full of serpents.

There it waddled up the drain, and so into the kitchen, where her little dog lay on the hearth-stone; it could not bear to stay in the fine chambers along with the ugly sister, and had taken refuge down here.

The husband walked on and on and on without ever seeing one, and every now and then he felt so hungry that he was obliged to eat one of the crusts of bread out of his bag. At last, when he was ready to drop from fatigue, he found himself on the edge of a great marsh, which bordered on one side the country of the nyamatsanes. But there were no more nyamatsanes here than anywhere else. They had all gone on a hunting expedition, as their larder was empty, and the only person left at home was their grandmother, who was so feeble she never went out of the house. Our friend looked on this as a great piece of luck, and made haste to kill her before the others returned, and to take out her liver, after which he dressed himself in her skin as well as he could. He had scarcely done this when he heard the noise of the nyamatsanes coming back to their grandmother, for they were very fond of her, and never stayed away from her longer than they could help. They rushed clattering into the hut, exclaiming, "We smell human flesh! Some man is here," and began to look about for him; but they only saw their old grandmother, who answered, in a trembling voice, "No, my children, no! What should any man be doing here?" The nyamatsanes paid no attention to her, and began to open all the cupboards, and peep under all the beds, crying out all the while, "A man is here! a man is here!" but they could find nobody, and at length, tired out with their long day"s hunting, they curled themselves up and fell asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2092'>Next morning they woke up quite refreshed, and made ready to start on another expedition; but as they did not feel happy about their grandmother they said to her, "Grandmother, won"t you come to-day and feed with us?"

Our friend pretended to do the same, but in reality he slipped the stones into his pouch, and swallowed the crusts of bread instead. However, as the nyamatsanes did not see this they had no idea that he was not really their grandmother. When they had eaten a great many pebbles they thought they had done enough for that day, and all went home together and curled themselves up to sleep. Next morning when they woke they said, "Let us go and amuse ourselves by jumping over the ditch," and every time they cleared it with a bound. Then they begged their grandmother to jump over it too, end with a tremendous effort she managed to spring right over to the other side. After this they had no doubt at all of its being their true grandmother, and went off to their hunting, leaving our friend at home in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='grandmother;home;doubt;friend;hunting' adjectives='true' verbs='go;be;have;leave' valence='5.96090909091' arousal='4.00363636364' dominance='5.72181818182'>the hut</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2093'>As soon as they had gone out of sight our hero made haste to take the liver from the place where he had hid it, threw off the skin of the old nyamatsane, and ran away as hard as he could, only stopping to pick up a very brilliant and polished little stone, which he put in his bag by the side of the liver.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2094'>Towards evening the nyamatsanes came back to the hut full of anxiety to know how their grandmother had got on during their absence. The first thing they saw on entering the door was her skin lying on the floor, and then they knew that they had been deceived, and they said to each other, "So we were right, after all, and it was human flesh we smelt." Then they stooped down to find traces of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;footstep;trace;pursuit' adjectives='hot' verbs='stoop;set;find;have;get' valence='5.398' arousal='3.961' dominance='5.456'>the man</entity>"s footsteps, and when they had got them instantly set out in hot pursuit.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2095'>Meanwhile our friend had journeyed many miles, and was beginning to feel quite safe and comfortable, when, happening to look round, he saw in the distance a thick cloud of dust moving rapidly. His heart stood still within him, and he said to himself, "I am lost. It is the nyamatsanes, and they will tear me in pieces," and indeed the cloud of dust was drawing near with amazing quickness, and the nyamatsanes almost felt as if they were already devouring him. Then as a last hope the man took the little stone that he had picked up out of his bag and flung it on the ground. The moment it touched the soil it became a huge rock, whose steep sides were smooth as glass, and on the top of it our hero hastily seated himself. It was in vain that the nyamatsanes tried to climb up and reach him; they slid down again much faster than they had gone up; and by sunset they were quite worn out, and fell asleep at the foot of the rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2096'>No sooner had the nyamatsanes tumbled off to sleep than the man stole softly down and fled away as fast as his legs would carry him, and by the time his enemies were awake he was a very long way off. They sprang quickly to their feet and began to sniff the soil round the rock, in order to discover traces of his footsteps, and they galloped after him with terrific speed. The chase continued for several days and nights; several times the nyamatsanes almost reached him, and each time he was saved by his little pebble.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2097'>Between his fright and his hurry he was almost dead of exhaustion when he reached his own village, where the nyamatsanes could not follow him, because of their enemies the dogs, which swarmed over all the roads. So they returned home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2098'>Then our friend staggered into his own hut and called to his wife: "Ichou! how tired I am! Quick, give me something to drink. Then go and get fuel and light a fire."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2099'>So she did what she was bid, and then her husband took the nyamatsane"s liver from his pouch and said to her, "There, I have brought you what you wanted, and now you know that I love you truly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2100'>And the wife answered, "It is well. Now go and take out the children, so that I may remain alone in the hut," and as she spoke she lifted down an old stone pot and put on the liver to cook. Her husband watched her for a moment, and then said, "Be sure you eat it all yourself. Do not give a scrap to any of the children, but eat every morsel up." So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='liver' adjectives='' verbs='take;eat' valence='5.8' arousal='3.9925' dominance='5.6725'>the woman</entity> took the liver and ate it all herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2101'>Directly the last mouthful had disappeared she was seized with such violent thirst that she caught up a great pot full of water and drank it at a single draught. Then, having no more in the house, she ran in next door and said, "Neighbour, give me, I pray you, something to drink." The neighbour gave her a large vessel quite full, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='neighbour;vessel;draught' adjectives='large;single;full;more' verbs='hold;drink;give' valence='5.8' arousal='4.36727272727' dominance='5.25181818182'>the woman</entity> drank it off at a single draught, and held it out for more.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2103'>So the woman went into another house, and drank all the water she could find; but the more she drank the more thirsty she became. She wandered in this manner through the whole village till she had drunk every water-pot dry. Then she rushed off to the nearest spring, and swallowed that, and when she had finished all the springs and wells about she drank up first the river and then a lake. But by this time she had drunk so much that she could not rise from the ground.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2104'>In the evening, when it was time for the animals to have their drink before going to bed, they found the lake quite dry, and they had to make up their minds to be thirsty till the water flowed again and the streams were full.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2106'>The next day, as soon as it was light, Big Lion marched straight for the lake, and all the other beasts followed him. He saw at once that the water had been troubled again, and was very angry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2107'>"Who has been drinking my water?" said he; and the little hare gave a jump, and, pointing to the rabbit, he answered, "Look there! it must be he! Why, there is mud all over his face and paws!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2108'>The rabbit, frightened out of his wits, tried to deny the fact, exclaiming, "Oh, no, indeed I never did;" but Big Lion would not listen, and commanded them to cane him with a birch rod.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2109'>Now the little hare was very much pleased with his cleverness in causing the rabbit to be beaten instead of himself, and went about boasting of it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2114'>The little hare saw that there was no use trying to hide it, so he answered pertly, "It was I who drank the water, but I made them think it was the rabbit." Then he turned and ran as fast as he could, with all the other beasts pursuing him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2115'>They were almost up to him when he dashed into a very narrow cleft in the rock, much too small for them to follow; but in his hurry he had left one of his long ears sticking out, which they just managed to seize.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2116'>When the last tail was out of sight the little hare crept cautiously out, and the first person he met was the rabbit.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2117'>But the rabbit was still sore and sulky, and he did not care to talk, so he answered, coldly, "You have treated me very badly. It was really you who drank that water, and you accused me of having done it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2123'>The rabbit did as he was told, and threw the little hare into the fire; but no sooner did the little hare begin to feel the heat of the flames than he took some green bay leaves he had plucked for the purpose and held them in the middle of the fire, where they crackled and made a great noise. Then he called loudly "Itchi, Itchi!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2126'>But the little hare only laughed, and said, "No, you may stay there! It is your own fault. Why were you such a fool as to let yourself be thrown in? Didn"t you know that fire burns?" And in a very few minutes nothing was left of the rabbit but a few bones.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2129'>When he got tired of going through the world singing this the little hare went back to his friends and entered the service of Big Lion. One day he said to his master, "Grandfather, shall I show you a splendid way to kill game?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2130'>"What is it?" asked Big Lion.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2133'>Pii, pii, all you animals come and see, Big Lion is dead, and now peace will be.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2134'>Directly they heard this they all came running. The little hare received them and said, "Pass on, this way to the lion." So they all entered into the Animal Kingdom. Last of all came the monkey with her baby on her back. She approached the ditch, and took a blade of grass and tickled Big Lion"s nose, and his nostrils moved in spite of his efforts to keep them still. Then the monkey cried, "Come, my baby, climb on my back and let us go. What sort of a dead body is it that can still feel when it is tickled?" And she and her baby went away in a fright. Then the little hare said to the other beasts, "Now, shut the gate of the Animal Kingdom." And it was shut, and great stones were rolled against it. When everything was tight closed the little hare turned to Big Lion and said "Now!" and Big Lion bounded out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lion;piece;animal' adjectives='big;other' verbs='tear;bound' valence='4.94625' arousal='4.39125' dominance='5.40625'>the ditch</entity> and tore the other animals in pieces.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2135'>But Big Lion kept all the choice bits for himself, and only gave away the little scraps that he did not care about eating; and the little hare grew very angry, and determined to have his revenge. He had long ago found out that Big Lion was very easily taken in; so he laid his plans accordingly. He said to him, as if the idea had just come into his head, "Grandfather, let us build a hut," and Big Lion consented. And when they had driven the stakes into the ground, and had made the walls of the hut, the little hare told Big Lion to climb upon the top while he stayed inside. When he was ready he called out, "Now, grandfather, begin," and Big Lion passed his rod through the reeds with which the roofs are always covered in that country. The little hare took it and cried, "Now it is my turn to pierce them," and as he spoke he passed the rod back through the reeds and gave Big Lion"s tail a sharp poke.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2136'>"What is pricking me so?" asked Big Lion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2137'>"Oh, just a little branch sticking out. I am going to break it," answered the little hare; but of course he had done it on purpose, as he wanted to fix Big Lion"s tail so firmly to the hut that he would not be able to move. In a little while he gave another prick, and Big Lion called again, "What is pricking me so?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2138'>This time the little hare said to himself, "He will find out what I am at. I must try some other plan. "So he called out, "Grandfather, you had better put your tongue here, so that the branches shall not touch you." Big Lion did as he was bid, and the little hare tied it tightly to the stakes of the wall. Then he went outside and shouted, "Grandfather, you can come down now," and Big Lion tried, but he could not move an inch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2139'>Then the little hare began quietly to eat Big Lion"s dinner right before his eyes, and paying no attention at all to his growls of rage. When he had quite done he climbed up on the hut, and, blowing his flute, he chanted "Pii, pii, fall rain and hail," and directly the sky was full of clouds, the thunder roared, and huge hailstones whitened the roof of the hut. The little hare, who had taken refuge within, called out again, "Big Lion, be quick and come down and dine with me." But there was no answer, not even a growl, for the hailstones had killed Big Lion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2140'>The little hare enjoyed himself vastly for some time, living comfortably in the hut, with plenty of food to eat and no trouble at all in getting it. But one day a great wind arose, and flung down the Big Lion"s half-dried skin from the roof of the hut. The little hare bounded with terror at the noise, for he thought Big Lion must have come to life again; but on discovering what had happened he set about cleaning the skin, and propped the mouth open with sticks so that he could get through. So, dressed in Big Lion"s skin, the little hare started on his travels.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2141'>The first visit he paid was to the hyaenas, who trembled at the sight of him, and whispered to each other, "How shall we escape from this terrible beast?" Meanwhile the little hare did not trouble himself about them, but just asked where the king of the hyaenas lived, and made himself quite at home there. Every morning each hyaena thought to himself, "To-day he is certain to eat me;" but several days went by, and they were all still alive. At length, one evening, the little hare, looking round for something to amuse him, noticed a great pot full of boiling water, so he strolled up to one of the hyaenas and said, "Go and get in." The hyaena dared not disobey, and in a few minutes was scalded to death. Then the little hare went the round of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;hare;round;hyaena;left' adjectives='boiling;little;male' verbs='go;meet;say;be;get' valence='6.065' arousal='3.975625' dominance='5.498125'>the village</entity>, saying to every hyaena he met, "Go and get into the boiling water," so that in a little while there was hardly a male left in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;hare;round;hyaena;left' adjectives='boiling;little;male' verbs='go;meet;say;be;get' valence='6.065' arousal='3.975625' dominance='5.498125'>the village</entity>.</paragraph>

The little hare jumped out through the mouth with a single spring, and fled away like lightning, all the hyaenas in full pursuit uttering great cries.

But as they drew near the old man, he jumped up, and beat back the raven, which mounted, with hoarse screams of disappointment, into the sky, and the little bird, freed from its enemy, nestled into the old man"s hand, and he carried it into the house.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2164'>One hot summer morning, the old man was walking slowly under the cool shadows of the big trees, and without thinking where he was going, he entered a bamboo thicket. As the bamboos became thinner, he found himself opposite to a beautiful garden, in the centre of which stood a tiny spick-and-span little house, and out of the house came a lovely maiden, who unlatched the gate and invited him in the most hospitable way to enter and rest. "Oh, my dear old friend," she exclaimed, "how glad I am you have found me at last! I am your little sparrow, whose life you saved, and whom you took such care of."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2165'>The old man seized her hands eagerly, but no time was given him to ask any questions, for the maiden drew him into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='food;hand;question;time;man' adjectives='old;maiden' verbs='be;draw;set;give;seize;ask;wait' valence='5.76266666667' arousal='3.89666666667' dominance='5.60866666667'>the house</entity>, and set food before him, and waited on him herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2166'>While he was eating, the damsel and her maids took their lutes, and sang and danced to him, and altogether the hours passed so swiftly that the old man never saw that darkness had come, or remembered the scolding he would get from his wife for returning home so late.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2167'>Thus, in dancing and singing, and talking over the days when the maiden was a sparrow hopping in and out of her cage, the night passed away, and when the first rays of sun broke through the hedge of bamboo, the old man started up, thanked his hostess for her friendly welcome, and prepared to say farewell. "I am not going to let you depart like that," said she; "I have a present for you, which you must take as a sign of my gratitude." And as she spoke, her servants brought in two chests, one of them very small, the other large and heavy. "Now choose which of them you will carry with you." So the old man chose the small chest, and hid it under his cloak, and set out on his homeward way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2168'>But as he drew near the house his heart sank a little, for he knew what a fury his wife would be in, and how she would abuse him for his absence. And it was even worse than he expected. However, long experience had taught him to let her storm and say nothing, so he lit his pipe and waited till she was tired out. The woman was still raging, and did not seem likely to stop, when her husband, who by this time had forgotten all about her, drew out the chest from under his cloak, and opened it. Oh, what a blaze met his eyes! gold and precious stones were heaped up to the very lid, and lay dancing in he sunlight. At the sight of these wonders even the scolding tongue ceased, and the woman approached, and took the stones in her hand, setting greedily aside those that were the largest and most costly. Then her voice softened, and she begged him quite politely to tell her where he had spent his evening, and how he had come by these wonderful riches. So he told her the whole story, and she listened with amazement, till he came to the choice which had been given him between the two chests. At this her tongue broke loose again, as she abused him for his folly in taking the little one, and she never rested till her husband had described the exact way which led to the sparrow-princess"s house. When she had got it into her head, she put on her best clothes and set out at once. But in her blind haste she often missed the path, and she wandered for several hours before she at length reached the little house. She walked boldly up to the door and entered the room as if the whole place belonged to her, and quite frightened the poor girl, who was startled at the sight of her old enemy. However, she concealed her feelings as well as she could, and bade the intruder welcome, placing before her food and wine, hoping that when she had eaten and drunk she might take her leave. But nothing of the sort.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2169'>"You will not let me go without a little present?" said the greedy wife, as she saw no signs of one being offered her. "Of course not," replied the girl, and at her orders two chests were brought in, as they had been before. The old woman instantly seized the bigger, and staggering under the weight of it, disappeared into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='good-bye;woman;weight' adjectives='old;bigger' verbs='stagger;wait;say;disappear;seize' valence='4.73777777778' arousal='4.17888888889' dominance='5.41666666667'>the forest</entity>, hardly waiting even to say good-bye.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2170'>It was a long way to her own house, and the chest seemed to grow heavier at every step. Sometimes she felt as if it would be impossible for her to get on at all, but her greed gave her strength, and at last she arrived at her own door. She sank down on the threshold, overcome with weariness, but in a moment was on her feet again, fumbling with the lock of the chest. But by this time night had come, and there was no light in the house, and the woman was in too much hurry to get to her treasures, to go and look for one. At length, however, the lock gave way, and the lid flew open, when, O horror! instead of gold and jewels, she saw before her serpents with glittering eyes and forky tongues. And they twined themselves about her and darted poison into her veins, and she died, and no man regretted her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2174'>Once upon a time there lived a man who had three sons. The eldest was called Peppe, the second Alfin, and the youngest Ciccu. They were all very poor, and at last things got so bad that they really had not enough to eat. So the father called his sons, and said to them, " My dear boys, I am too old to work any more, and there is nothing left for me but to beg in the streets."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2175'>"No, no!" exclaimed his sons; "that you shall never do. Rather, if it must be, would we do it ourselves. But we have thought of a better plan than that."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2177'>"Well, we will take you in the forest, where you shall cut wood, and then we will bind it up in bundles and sell it in the town." So their father let them do as they said, and they all made their way into the forest; and as the old man was weak from lack of food his sons took it in turns to carry him on their backs. Then they built a little hut where they might take shelter, and set to work. Every morning early the father cut his sticks, and the sons bound them in bundles, and carried them to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='food;father;bundle;son;stick;man' adjectives='much;old' verbs='carry;bind;need;cut;bring' valence='5.45333333333' arousal='4.08866666667' dominance='5.26866666667'>the town</entity>, bringing back the food the old man so much needed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2178'>Some months passed in this way, and then the father suddenly fell ill, and knew that the time had come when he must die.

The house I leave to my sons, who are to live in it together; the fig-tree I divide as follows. To my son Peppe I leave the branches. To my son Alfin I leave the trunk. To my son Ciccu I leave the fruit. Besides the house and tree, I have an old coverlet, which I leave to my eldest son. And an old purse, which I leave to my second son. And a horn, which I leave to my youngest son. And now farewell."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2180'>Thus speaking, he laid himself down, and died quietly. The brothers wept bitterly for their father, whom they loved, and when they had buried him they began to talk over their future lives. "What shall we do now?" said they. "Shall we live in the wood, or go back to the village?" And they made up their minds to stay where they were and continue to earn their living by selling firewood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2181'>One very hot evening, after they had been working hard all day, they fell asleep under a tree in front of the hut. And as they slept there came by three fairies, who stopped to look at them.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2183'>"Yes, what shall it be?" asked another.</paragraph>

So they vanished, without knowing that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;say;hear;know;have;vanish' valence='6.01' arousal='4.11285714286' dominance='5.94285714286'>Ciccu</entity> had been awake and heard all they said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2187'>The next day, when they were all cutting wood, he said to his brothers, "That old coverlet and the purse are no use to you; I wish you would give them to me. I have a fancy for them, for the sake of old times." Now Peppe and Alfin were very fond of Ciccu, and never refused him anything, so they let him have the coverlet and the purse without a word. When he had got them safely Ciccu went on, "Dear brothers, I am tired of the forest. I want to live in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='work;trade' adjectives='' verbs='live;want' valence='5.91666666667' arousal='4.59833333333' dominance='5.79'>the town</entity>, and work at some trade."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2188'>"O Ciccu! stay with us," they cried. "We are very happy here; and who knows how we shall get on elsewhere?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2189'>"We can always try," answered Ciccu; "and if times are bad we can come back here and take up wood-cutting." So saying he picked up his bundle of sticks, and his brothers did the same.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2190'>But when they reached the town they found that the market was overstocked with firewood, and they did not sell enough to buy themselves a dinner, far less to get any food to carry home. They were wondering sadly what they should do when Ciccu said, "Come with me to the inn and let us have something to eat." They were so hungry by this time that they did not care much whether they paid for it or not, so they followed Ciccu, who gave his orders to the host. "Bring us three dishes, the nicest that you have, and a good bottle of wine."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2191'>"Ciccu! Ciccu!" whispered his brothers, horrified at this extravagance, "are you mad? How do you ever mean to pay for it?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2193'>The brothers hurried on, without needing to be told twice, "for," thought they, "he has no money, and of course there will be a row."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2194'>When they were out of sight Ciccu asked the landlord how much he owed, and then said to his purse, "Dear purse, give me, I pray you, six florins," and instantly six florins were in the purse. Then he paid the bill and joined his brothers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2195'>"How did you manage?" they asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2196'>"Never you mind," answered he. "I have paid every penny," and no more would he say. But the other two were very uneasy, for they felt sure something must be wrong, and the sooner they parted company with Ciccu the better. Ciccu understood what they were thinking, and, drawing forty gold pieces from his pocket, he held out twenty to each, saying, "Take these and turn them to good account. I am going away to seek my own fortune." Then he embraced them, and struck down another road.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2197'>He wandered on for many days, till at length he came to the town where the king had his court.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2198'>Next he locked his door, and ordered a shower of gold to cover the staircase, and when this was done, the door was flung wide open, and everyone came and peeped at the shining golden stairs. Lastly the rumour of these wonders reached the ears of the king, who left his palace to behold these splendours with his own eyes. And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='respect' adjectives='' verbs='receive;show' valence='6.7575' arousal='4.285' dominance='6.5725'>Ciccu</entity> received him with all respect, and showed him over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='respect' adjectives='' verbs='receive;show' valence='6.7575' arousal='4.285' dominance='6.5725'>the house</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2199'>When the king went home he told such stories of what he had seen that his wife and daughter declared that they must go and see them too. So the king sent to ask Ciccu"s leave, and Ciccu answered that if the queen and the princess would be pleased to do him such great honour he would show them anything they wished. Now the princess was as beautiful as the sun, and when Ciccu looked upon her his heart went out to her, and he longed to have her to wife. The princess saw what was passing in his mind, and how she could make use of it to satisfy her curiosity as to the golden stairs; so she praised him and flattered him, and put cunning questions, till at length Ciccu"s head was quite turned, and he told her the whole story of the fairies and their gifts. Then she begged him to lend her the purse for a few days, so that she could have one made like it, and so great was the love he had for her that he gave it to her at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2200'>The princess returned to the palace, taking with her the purse, which she had not the smallest intention of ever restoring to Ciccu. Very soon Ciccu had spent all the money he had by him, and could get no more without the help of his purse. Of course, he went at once to the king"s daughter, and asked her if she had done with it, but she put him off with some excuse, and told him to come back next day. The next day it was the same thing, and the next, till a great rage filled Ciccu"s heart instead of the love that had been there. And when night came he took in his hand a thick stick, wrapped himself in the coverlet, and wished himself in the chamber of the princess. The princess was asleep, but Ciccu seized her arm and pulled her out of bed, and beat her till she gave back the purse. Then he took up the coverlet, and wished he was safe in his own house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2201'>No sooner had he gone than the princess hastened to her father and complained of her sufferings. Then the king rose up in a fury, and commanded Ciccu to be brought before him. "You richly deserve death," said he, "but I will allow you to live if you will instantly hand over to me the coverlet, the purse, and the horn."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2202'>What could Ciccu do?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2203'>While he was wondering how he was to live it suddenly came into his mind that this was the season for the figs to ripen, and he said to himself, "I will go and see if the tree has borne well." So he set off home, where his brothers still lived, and found them living very uncomfortably, for they had spent all their money, and did not know how to make any more. However, he was pleased to see that the fig-tree looked in splendid condition, and was full of fruit. He ran and fetched a basket, and was just feeling the figs, to make sure which of them were ripe, when his brother Peppe called to him, "Stop! The figs of course are yours, but the branches they grow on are mine, and I forbid you to touch them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2204'>Ciccu did not answer, but set a ladder against the tree, so that he could reach the topmost branches, and had his foot already on the first rung when he heard the voice of his brother Alfin: "Stop! the trunk belongs to me, and I forbid you to touch it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2205'>Then they began to quarrel violently, and there seemed no chance that they would ever cease, till one of them said, "Let us go before a judge."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2206'>"This is my verdict," said the judge. "The figs in truth belong to you, but you cannot pluck them without touching both the trunk and the branches. Therefore you must give your first basketful to your brother Peppe, as the price of his leave to put your ladder against the tree; and the second basketful to your brother Alfin, for leave to shake his boughs. The rest you can keep for yourself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2207'>And the brothers were contented, and returned home, saying one to the other, "We will each of us send a basket of figs to the king.

Now this horse was not like other horses, for it was a talking horse, and knew a great deal about many things, so it answered, "Fear nothing, and do as I tell you.

When the bag was full Ciccu put it on his shoulder and stole into the house of the Man-eater (who had gone to look for his dinner) and let them all out in his bedroom. He himself hid carefully under the bed and waited. The Man-eater came in late, very tired with his long walk, and flung himself on the bed, placing his sword with its shining blade by his side. Scarcely had he lain down than the mosquitos began to buzz about and bite him, and he rolled from side to side trying to catch them, which he never could do, though they always seemed to be close to his nose.

But the two brothers did not love Ciccu any better because he had succeeded when they hoped he would have failed, and one day they spoke to the king. "It is all very well for Ciccu to have got possession of the sword, but it would have been far more to your majesty"s honour if he had captured the Man-eater himself." The king thought upon these words, and at last he said to Ciccu, "Ciccu, I shall never rest until you bring me back the Man-eater himself. You may have any help you like, but somehow or other you must manage to do it." Ciccu felt very much cast, down at these words, and went to the stable to ask advice of his friend the horse.

"Jump down, and throw the fish into the water; he will be useful to us," and Ciccu did so. Farther along the hillside they saw an eagle whose leg was caught in a snare.

Ciccu seated himself on the stone, and the horse went on to the courtyard of the castle, where he began to trot round in a graceful and elegant manner.

But the horse made one bound forward, and the princess was forced to hold tight by his mane, lest she should fall off.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2274'>There was once a man whose name was Don Giovanni de la Fortuna, and he lived in a beautiful house that his father had built, and spent a great deal of money.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2278'>"Well, here is a purse; take it and say to it, "Dear purse, give me some money," and you will get as much as you can want But the charm will only work if you promise to remain three years, three months, and three days without washing and without combing and without shaving your beard or changing your clothes. If you do all this faithfully, when the time is up you shall keep the purse for yourself, and I will let you off any other conditions."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2279'>Now Don Giovanni was a man who never troubled his head about the future. He did not once think how very uncomfortable he should be all those three years, but only that he should be able, by means of the purse, to have all sorts of things he had been obliged to do without; so he joyfully put the purse in his pocket and went on his way. He soon began to ask for money for the mere pleasure of it, and there was always as much as he needed. For a little while he even forgot to notice how dirty he was getting, but this did not last long, for his hair became matted with dirt and hung over his eyes, and his pilgrim"s dress was a mass of horrible rags and tatters.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2280'>He was in this state when, one morning, he happened to be passing a fine palace; and, as the sun was shining bright and warm, he sat down on the steps and tried to shake off some of the dust which he had picked up on the road.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2283'>"What is that you can do?" laughed the gentleman.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2285'>"Oh, the dirty creature is quite mad!" thought the gentleman. "I shall just accept his offer for a joke." And aloud he said: " All right; follow me, and we will go to a lawyer and get him to make a contract." And Don Giovanni followed him, and an agreement was drawn up by which the house was to be sold at once, and a large sum of money paid down in eight days. Then the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='dear;inn;purse;room;gold' adjectives='full;sovereign' verbs='be;hire;put;say;stand;have;go;fill' valence='5.89227272727' arousal='3.79545454545' dominance='5.71227272727'>Don</entity> went to an inn, where he hired two rooms, and, standing in one of them, said to his purse, " Dear purse, fill this room with gold;" and when the eight days were up it was so full you could not have put in another sovereign.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2286'>When the owner of the house came to take away his money Don Giovanni led him into the room and said: "There, just pocket what you want." The gentleman stared with open mouth at the astonishing sight; but he had given his word to sell the house, so he took his money, as he was told, and went away with his wife to look for some place to live in. And Don Giovanni left the inn and dwelt in the beautiful rooms, where his rags and dirt looked sadly out of place. And every day these got worse and worse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2287'>By-and-bye the fame of his riches reached the ears of the king, and, as he himself was always in need of money, he sent for Don Giovanni, as he wished to borrow a large sum. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gold;sack;waggon' adjectives='huge;laden' verbs='send;agree;want;lend' valence='5.97444444444' arousal='4.33444444444' dominance='5.56111111111'>Don Giovanni</entity> readily agreed to lend him what he wanted, and sent next day a huge waggon laden with sacks of gold.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2289'>The king took as much as he had need of; then ordered the rest to be returned to Don Giovanni, who refused to receive it, saying, "Tell his majesty I am much hurt at his proposal. I shall certainly not take back that handful of gold, and, if he declines to accept it, keep it yourself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2290'>The servant departed and delivered the message, and the king wondered more than ever how anyone could be so rich. At last he spoke to the queen: "Dear wife, this man has done me a great service, and has, besides, behaved like a gentleman in not allowing me to send back the money. I wish to give him the hand of our eldest daughter."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2293'>The messenger took back this answer, but a second time returned with the request that Don Giovanni would present them with his picture, so that they might know what sort of a person to expect.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2301'>The whole of the royal family came down to the ship to receive him, and the whole way the queen and the elder princess teased the sister about the dirty husband she was going to have. But when they saw how handsome he really was their hearts were filled with envy and anger, so that their eyes were blinded, and they fell over into the sea and were drowned. And the youngest daughter rejoiced in the good luck that had come to her, and they had a splendid wedding when the days of mourning for her mother and sister were ended.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>|HERE have Folk-Tales had their begin-  ning? Philologists are inclined to the  belief that to answer such a question one  must look far into the depths of a Past  more remote than^ that of ancient Egypt, more pro-  found than that of Nineveh and Babylon  z dim,  impenetrable Past where at the primitive fireside of  Humanity, the stories of the slayers of the Giants and  of the Hero who rescues the enchanted Princess from  her perils were told to listening audiences of the  adult children of a race yet infant in its simplicity.  Folk-Tales are as universal as human speech, and,  as one language differing from another had, after all,  its beginning in a single parent stock of vowels and  consonants articulated into speech, so the folk-tales of  one people differ from another only in a degree lim-  ited by circumstances and surroundings. For there  is no mistaking the significance of the fact that each  group of these quaint and curious Romances is so  similar in its variants that it is hardly^possible to sup-  pose otherwise than that all grew originally from one  parent root founded in the very fundamental begin-  ning of human imagination. The scientific students</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>of folk-tales have even arranged the thousands of dif-  ferent forms into some score or less of general types,  and these again may be condensed into a third or a  quarter as many species. Indeed, when the final test  is applied, all may be resolved down into the one uni-  versal theme  perhaps the struggle between light  and darkness; perhaps the conflict between summer  and winter; perhaps (and this seems more likely)  that ceaseless striving of good against evil, of weak-  ness against oppression, of simplicity against cun-  ning, of innocence against cruelty, that was since the  world began.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>Let us take, for example, a very universal type of  story in which three brothers are called upon to un-  dertake some miraculous task, the reward in the suc-  cessful performance of which is to be the possession  of the beautiful Princess and of half the kingdom.  (The story rarely deviates from the statement that, of  these three brothers, two are wise and reputable,  strong and valiant; the third  always the youngest   being held by all the world to be a mere stupid wit-  less oaf. He sits at home grubbing amid the dust  and ashes, whilst his brothers go about in fine clothes  and at ease. He is kicked and cuffed from pillar to  post, and the refuse of the house is thrown to him to  eat as it might be thrown to a mangy dog. The two  elder brothers embark upon the performance of the  adventure  jubilant, joyous, confident of success.  rThey return beaten, humiliated, overthrown. Then</paragraph>

He unexpectedly devdops a marvellous cunning and  courage; he sla3rs dragons; he conquers giants; he  clind&gt;s mountains of glass; he rescues the distressed  Princess ; he even goes to the end of the earth to fetch  her back the Fruit of Happiness or the Water of  Life so that he may restore her into a resurrection of  joy and beauty. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>This type of folk-tale belongs to every race of  people and to every nation in the world; it extends  from the farthest bounds of Scandinavia to the utter-  most part of India. The variants upon the theme  are innumeraixle, but the theme itself is as universal  as the words of human speech. It is impossible not  to believe that it holds within it some mysterious sig-  nificance that appertains to the very psychical exist-*  ence of humanity. Were it otherwise it would long  since have been dissipated and vanished into forget-  fulness instead of being repeated and varied into a  hundred languages and a diousand differentiated  forms.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='102'>The spiritual significance of the story is the same  whether it be told of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='significance;story;shepherd' adjectives='spiritual;same' verbs='be;be;tell'>David</entity>, the Hebrew shepherd</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>Another type of story, favorite with all peoples, is  that of the clever thief who, by cunning and inge-  nuity, circumvents the entire cumbrous machinery of  established law and order. He, too, in many vari-  ants, marries a Princess and, in the end, as King, be-  comes the very keystone of that structure of legiti-  mate order which he one time himself did so much to  undermine.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='110'>This type of story exists, not only in the folk-tales  of Germany and Scandinavia, of the Scottish High-  lands and the plains of southern Europe, but it ap-  pears with a singular identity of form in a folk-tale  transcribed by the collector of certain North Ameri-  can Indian myths. It is recounted, not only at the  firesides of to-day, but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fireside;to-day;priest;legend' adjectives='ancient;dead;great' verbs='be;recount;have;tell;forget'>Herodotus</entity> had it, he tells us,  from the priests of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fireside;to-day;priest;legend' adjectives='ancient;dead;great' verbs='be;recount;have;tell;forget'>Egypt</entity> as an ancient legend of  dead and forgotten days of great Pharaohs of the  past.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>It is not so easy, upon the face, to understand why  the stories of theft and of lawlessness should possess  such a charm. The paradox is more comprehensible  when one sees in the narrative a form of that univer-  sal and eternal revolt of helplessness against tyranny.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='115'>Again, there is the story of the poor brodier and  of the rich brother  of how the rich brother supplies  the necessities of the poor brother widi a harsh* and  grudging reluctance, setting some seemingly impos-  sible task, by way of return for the niggardly bounty  received. From his poverty and need, the poor  brother arises to glory, power, and opulence; from  his wealth and abundance, the rich brother sinks into  humiliation and shame. Such is the theme that un-  derlies the Oriental story of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='theme;derly;story;scandi;tale;man;quern;hell;wealth;happus;ness;soldier;dif;variant;folk-romance;nation;race;face;earth' adjectives='such;navian;poor;magic;poor;ferent' verbs='be;bring;grind;inhabit'>Ali Baba</entity>; the Scandi-  navian tale of the poor man who brought the magic  quern from Hell that ground him wealth and happi-  ness; the poor soldier of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='theme;derly;story;scandi;tale;man;quern;hell;wealth;happus;ness;soldier;dif;variant;folk-romance;nation;race;face;earth' adjectives='such;navian;poor;magic;poor;ferent' verbs='be;bring;grind;inhabit'>Germany</entity>; and so, with dif-  ferent variants, through the folk-romances of every  nation and every race that inhabits the face of the  earth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='116'>Here also a universal intention underlies all the  different tales, pointing to one parent root from  which all have sprung.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='117'>These are only three of a multitude of groups  which I have adduced to establish my proposition. I  will only speak of two other types that, to my mind,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='120'>Introduction</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>are singularly pregnant of a profound significance so  universal that they must have belonged to the very  foundation of human existence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='122'>The first of these is the sublime idea of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='idea;rection;death;life' adjectives='sublime' verbs='be'>Resur</entity>-  rection from Death to Life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='123'>Sometimes the simple folk-story tells of an en-  chanted Princess who lies entranced for a hundred  years until the expected hero appears to waken her;  sometimes the hero or the heroine dies and the soul  reappears in the form of an animal until, by means of  some peculiar charm or mystic ceremony, it is rein-  carnated in the original human body; sometimes the  hero of the narrative is slain by the villain, and is re-  vived by some faithful friend or animal companion,  who brings to him the Water of Life or the Fruit of  Life from the uttermost extremity of the earth ; some-  times it is a great King or a great Hero who had gone  from the world only for a little while, leaving behind  him a promise that, by and by, he shall return and  bring peace and happiness, hope and comfort, to the  lowly and oppressed. The profound significance of  this group of stories needs no explication.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='124'>The theme of the second group, of which I now  speak, is that in which it is told of beasts who speak  and have human intelligence and who, in the ex-  tremity of his need, bring help and succor to the  Hero of the tale.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='125'>This, also, is a type of story universal to all hu-  manity and which must have had its root in the very</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='129'>beginnings of human life, speaking, as it does, of the  kinship of man with the dumb beasts of the earth and  air. For as the one of these groups of romances  speaks of the imperishability and the immortality of  the human soul, so the other  equally primitive   speaks of the consanguinity of man with the things of  the earth whereon he finds his temporary dwelling-  place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>It is these underlying significances of folk-tales  that make them immortal; that endow them with  perennial life  otherwise they would never have de-  scended to us of the present from out that profound  and unfathomable past. The thunder epics of in-  numerable dead poets have rumbled away into si-  lence of eternity; only huge fragments of Homer and  of Aeschylus remain to us of the present day; but  those quaint, simple, childish narratives, told at the  fireside, existing only as they have been passed from  lip to lip, have reached us unbroken  almost un-  changed in their very diction  from the very begin-  nings of human speech. So, likewise, they shall  doubtless last as long as this ancient world shall throb  with human life.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='190'>ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen  who loved each other so much that they were  never happy unless they were together. Day after day  they went out hundng or fishing ; night after night they  went to balls or to the opera ; they sang, and danced,  and ate sugar-plums, and were the gayest of the gay, and  all their subjects followed their example so that the king-  dom was called the Joyous Land. Now in the next  kingdom everything was as different as it could possibly  be. The King was sulky and savage, and never enjoyed  himself at all. He looked so ugly and cross that all his  subjects feared him, and he hated the very sight of a  cheerful face ; so if he ever caught any one smiling he  had his head cut off that very minute. This kingdom  was very appropriately called the Land of Tears. Now  when this wicked King heard of the happiness of the  Jolly King, he was so jealous that he collected a great  army and set out to fight him, and the news of his ap-  proach was soon brought to the King and Queen. The  Queen, when she heard of it, was frightened out of her</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='226'>Then the Fairy answered that the Princess would be  as pretty, and clever, and well brought up as it was pos-  sible to be, and the old King growled to the Queen that  it was lucky for her that it was so, as they would cer-  tainly have been hanged if it were otherwise. Then  he stamped off, taking the Fairy with him, and leaving  the poor Queen in tears.</paragraph>

At last, one evening, as the Queen sat at her  spinning-wheel  for the King was- so avaricious that she  was made to work day and night  she saw a tiny, pretty  little mouse creep out of a hole, and said to it :</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='235'>She had hardly spoken when she saw upon the table  a delicious little roast partridge, and two dishes of pre*  served fruit. "Truly," said she, **a kind action never  goes unrewarded;" and she and the little Princess ate  their supper with great satisfaction, and then the Queen  gave what was left to the little mouse, who danced better  than ever afterward. The next mornii^ came the jailer  with the Queen\"s allowance of three peas, which he  brought in upon a laige dish to make them look smaller ;  but as soon as he set it down the little mouse came and  ate up all three, so that when the Queen wanted her din-  ner there was nothing left for her. Then she was quite  provoked, and said :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='236'>^\" What a bad little beast that mouse must be ! If it  goes on like this I shall be starved." But when she  glanced at the dish again it was covered with all sorts of  nice things to eat, and the Queen made a very good  dinner, and was gayer than usual over it. But afterward  as she sat at her spinning*wheel she began to consider  what would happen if the little Princess did not grow</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='241'>" Oh ! if I could only think of some way of escaping/*</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='242'>As she spoke she saw the little mouse playing in a  corner with some long straws. The Queen took them  and began to plait them, saying :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='243'>*^ If only I had straws enough 1 would make a basket  with them, and let my baby down in it from the window  to any kind passer-by who would take care of her."</paragraph>

She really could not  imagine where all the nice things came from. At last one  day when the basket was finished, the Queen was looking  out of the window to see how long a cord she must make  to lower it to the bottom of the tower, when she noticed  a little old woman who was leaning upon her stick and  looking up at her. Presently she said :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='245'>^\" I know your trouble, madam. If you like I Will  help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='246'>" Oh ! my dear friend," said the Queen.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='251'>The Queen when she heard this began to cry, but  made no answer, and the old woman after waiting a few  minutes asked her what was the matter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='252'>" Why," said the Queen, " there is only one mouse  in this garret, and that is such a dear, pretty little thing  that I cannot bear to think of its being killed."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='254'>And she hobbled off grumbling and growling. As to  the Queen, she was so disappointed that, in spite of finding  a better dinner than usual, and seeing the little mouse  dancing in its merriest mood, she could do nothing but  cry. That night when her baby was fast asleep she packed  it into the basket, and wrote on a slip of paper, \"^ This  unhappy little girl is called Delicia ! " This she pinned  to its robe, and then very sadly she was shutting the  basket, when in sprang the little mouse and sat on the  baby\"s pillow.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='260'>The Queen was immensely astonished when the  Mouse began to speak, and still more so when she saw  its little sharp nose turn to a beautiful face, and its paws  to hands and feet ; then it suddenly grew tall, and the  Queen recognized the Fairy who had come with the  wicked King to visit hen</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='261'>The Fairy smiled at her astonished look, and said :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='262'>\"^ I wanted to see if you were faithful and capable of  feeling a real friendship for me, for you see we fiuries are  rich in everything but friends, and those are hard to find."</paragraph>

Then, turning  to the little Princess, she kissed her rosy lips three times,  saying :</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='269'>The Queen, quite delighted, thanked the Fairy grate-  fully, and b^ged her to take chaise of the little Delida  and bring her up as her own daughter. This she agreed  to do, and then they shut the basket and lowered it  carefully, baby and all, to the ground at the foot of  the tower. The Fairy then changed herself back into  the form of a mouse, and this delayed her a few seconds,  after which she ran nimbly down the straw rope, but only  to find when she got to the bottom that the baby had  disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='270'>In the greatest terror she ran up again to the Queen,  crying :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='271'>*\" All is lost ! my enemy Cancaline has stolen the  Princess away.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='272'>When the Queen heard this terrible news she was  heart-broken, and begged the Fairy to do all she could  to get the poor little Princess back again. At this mo-  ment in came the jailer, and when he missed the little  Princess he at once told the King, who came in a great  fury asking what the Queen had done with her. She an-  swered that a fairy, whose name she did not know, had  come and carried her off by force. Upon this the King  stamped upon the ground, and cried in a terrible voice :</paragraph>

And without another word he dragged the unlucky  Queen out into the nearest wood, and climbed up into a  tree to look for a branch to which he could hang her.  But when he was quite high up, the Fairy, who had  made herself invisible and followed them gave him a  sudden push, which made him lose his footing and fall to  the ground with a crash and break four of his teeth, and  while he was trying to mend them the fairy carried the  Queen off in her flying chariot to a beautiful castle, where  she was so kind to her that but for the loss of Delicia the  Queen would have been perfectly happy. But though  the good little mouse did her very utmost, they could  not find out where <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mouse;princess' adjectives='good;little;utmost;little' verbs='do;find;have;hide'>Cancaline</entity> had hidden the little  Princess.</paragraph>

But when the  Queen rushed in and kissed her twenty times in a minute,  and laughed, and cried, and told Delicia all her history,  the Princess was wild with delight. Then the Fairy  showed her all the wonderful dresses and jewels she had  brought for her and said :</paragraph>

Upon this the people cried with one accord,  " We will, we will ! we have been gloomy and miserable  too long already."

He  was so charming that Delicia loved him from the moment  their eyes met, and as for him, of course he could not  help thinking himself the luckiest Prince in the world.  The Queen felt that she had really come to the end of  her misfortunes at last, and they all lived happily ever  after.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='368'>Every day she gave the Princess a lovely new frock  of gold brocade, or satin, or velvet, and when she was  hungry she had bowls full of s^gar-plums, and at least  twenty pots of jam. Everybody said she was the hap-  piest Princess in the world. Now there lived at this  same court a very rich old duchess whose name was  Crumbly. She was more frightful than tongue can tell ;  her hair was red as fire, and she had but one eye, and  that not a pretty one ! Her face was as broad as a full  moon, and her mouth was so large that everybody who  met her would have been afraid they were going to be  eaten up, only she had no teeth. As she was as cross as  she was ugly, she could not bear to hear any one saying  how pretty and how charming Graciosa was ; so she  presently went away from the court to her own castle,  which was not far off. But if anybody who went to see  her happened to mention the charming Princess, she  would cry angrily :</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='373'>Soon after this, to the great grief of the Princess, the  Queen was taken ill and died, and the King became so  melancholy that for a whole year he shut himself up in  his palace. At last his physicians, fearing that he would  fall ill, ordered that he should go out and amuse him-  self; so a hunting party was arranged, but as it was  very hot weather the King soon got tired, and said  he would dismount and rest at a castle which they  were passing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='374'>u"This happened to be the Duchess Grumbly"s castle,  and when she heard that the King was coming she went  out to meet him, and said that the cellar was the coolest  place in the whole castle if he would condescend to come  down into it. So down they went together, and the  King seeing about two hundred great casks ranged side  by side, asked if it was only for herself that she had this  immense store of wine. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='375'>" Yes, sire," answered she, " it is for myself alone ; but  I shall be most happy to let you taste some of it.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='410'>"Alas! who would not be vexed?" answered she,  " for the King intends to marry again, and has chosen  for his new bride my enemy, the hideous <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;bride;enemy' adjectives='new;hideous' verbs='answer;intend;marry;have;choose'>Duchess Grumbly</entity>."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='418'>Meanwhile the Duchess Grumbly was also occupied  in attiring herself. She had one of her shoe heels made  an inch or so higher than the other, that she might not  limp so much, and put in a cunningly made glass eye in  the place of the one she had lost. She dyed her red  hair black, and painted her face. Then she put on a  gorgeous robe of lilac satin lined with blue, and a yellow  petticoat trimmed with violet ribbons, and because she  had heard that queens always rode into their new do-  minions, she ordered a horse to be made ready for her  to ride.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='419'>While Graciosa was waiting until the King should be  ready to set out, she went down all alone through the  garden into a little wood, where she sat down upon a mossy  bank and began to think. And her thoughts were so  doleful that very soon she began to cry, and she cried,  and cried, and forgot all about going back to the palace,  until she suddenly saw a handsome page standing before  her. He was dressed in green, and the cap which he  held in his hand was adorned with white plumes. When  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='knee' adjectives='' verbs='look;go;say'>Graciosa</entity> looked at him he went down on one knee, and  said to her :</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='425'>The Princess was surprised, and, if the truth must be  told, very much delighted at the appearance of this  charming page, whom she could not remember to have  seen before. Thinking he might belong to the house-  hold of the Duchess, she said :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='426'>How long have you been one of the King\"s pages ? "  I am not in the service of the King, madam,\"\" an-  swered he, " but in yours."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='427'>"In mine?" said the Princess with great surprise,  **Then how is it that I have never seen you before ? "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='428'>"Ah, Princess ! " said he, " I have never before dared  to present myself to you, but now the King\"s marriage  threatens you with so many dangers that I have resolved  to tell you at once how much I love you already, and I  trust that in time I may win your regard.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='430'>So they went back to the palace together, and there  Graciosa found a beautiful horse which Percinet had  brought for her to ride.

Indeed, she was so pretty that it was a real</paragraph>

When the * horse which the  Duchess was to ride appeared beside Graciosa"s, it looked  no better than an old cart horse, and as to their trap-  pings, there was simply no comparison between them, as  the Princess"s saddle and bridle were one glittering mass  of diamonds. The King had so many other things to  think of that he did not notice this, but all his courtiers  were entirely taken up with admiring the Princess and  her charming Page in green, who was more handsome  and distinguished-looking than all the rest of the court  put together. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='435'>u"When they met the Duchess Grumbly she was seated  in an open carriage trying in vain to look dignified.  The King and the Princess saluted her, and her horse  was brought forward for her to mount.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>Upon this the King commanded Graciosa to dis*  mount and to beg the Duchess to honor her by mounting  her horse. The Princess obeyed in silence, and the  Duchess, without looking at her or thanking her, scram-  bled up upon the beautiful horse, where she sat looking  like a bundle of clothes, and eight officers had to hold  her up for fear she should fall ofF.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='438'>Even then she was not satisfied, and was sdll grum-  bling and muttering, so they asked her what was the  matter.</paragraph>

The Duchess was greatly elated, and as she sat  there in state would not have wished to change places  even with Graciosa. But at the moment when it was  least expected the beautiful horse began to plunge and  rear and kick, and finally to run away at such a pace that  it was imposfflble to stop him. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='444'>u"At first the Duchess clung to the saddle, but she was  very soon thrown off and fell in a heap among the stones  and thorns, and there they found her, shaken to a jelly,  and collected what was left of her as if she had been  a broken glass.

Graciosa,  much against her will, was forced into it, and away they  drove, and never stopped until they reached a great forest,  a hundred leagues from the palace. This forest was so  gloomy, and so full of lions, tigers, bears and wolves,  that nobody dared pass through it even by daylight, and  here they set down the unhappy Princess in the middle  of the black night, and left her in spite of all her tears  and entreaties. The Princess stood quite still at first  from sheer bewilderment, but when the last sound of the  retreating carriages died away in the distance she began  to run aimlessly hither and thither, sometimes knocking  herself agsdnst a tree, sometimes tripping over a stone,  fearing every minute that she would be eaten up by the  lions. Presently she was too tired to advance another  step, so she threw herself down upon the ground and  cried miserably :</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='501'>She had hardly spoken when all the forest was lighted  up with a sudden glow. Every tree seemed to be send-  ing out a soft radiance, which was clearer than moonlight  and softer than daylight, and at the end of a long avenue  of trees opposite to her the Princess saw a palace of clear  crystal which blazed like the sun.

The Princess joyfully mounted with  him into a little sledge, drawn by two stags, which bounded  off and drew them swiftly to the wonderful palace, where  the Queen received her with the greatest kindness, and a  splendid banquet was served at once. Graciosa was so  happy to have found Percinet, and to have escaped from  the gloomy forest and all its terrors, that she was very  hungry and very merry,, and they were a gay party. After  supper they went into another lovely room, where the  crystal walls were covered with pictures, and the Princess  saw with great surprise that her own history was repre-  sented, even down to the moment when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='supper;room;crystal;wall;picture;princess;surprise;history;moment;forest' adjectives='lovely;great;own;repre' verbs='go;be;cover;see;be;sent;find'>Percinet</entity> found  her in the forest.</paragraph>

He begged her to consider  again how unhappy the wicked Queen would make her,  and how, if she would but marry him, all the fairy palace  would be hers, and his one thought would be to please  her. But, in spite of everything he could say, the  Princess was quite determined to go back, though he at  last persuaded her to stay eight days, which were so full  of pleasure and amusement that they passed like a few  hours. On the last day, Graciosa, who had often felt  anxious to know what was going on in her father"s palace,  said to Percinet that she was sure that he could find out  for her, if he would, what reason the Queen had given  her father for her sudden, disappearance. Percinet at  first oflFered to send his courier to find out, but the  Princess said : "</paragraph>

When the Princess saw that the King was  so sorry for her pretended death that he could neither  eat nor drink, she cried : "</paragraph>

At first he was very much  startled by Graciosa"s sudden appearance, but she told  him how the Queen had left her out in the forest, and  how she had caused a log of wood to be buried. The  King, who did not know what to think, sent quickly and  had it dug up, and sure enough it was as the Princess had  said. Then he caressed Graciosa, and made her sit down  to supper with him, and they were as happy as possible.  But someone had by this time told the wicked Queen  that Graciosa had come back, and was at supper with the  King, and in she flew in a terrible fury. The poor old  King quite trembled before her, and when she declared  that Graciosa was not the Princess at all, but a wicked  impostor, and that if the King did not give her up at  once she would go back to her own castle and never see  him again, he had not a word to say, and really seemed  to believe that it was not Graciosa after all. So the  Queen in great triumph sent for her waiting women, who  dragged the unhappy Princess away and shut her up in  a garret ; they took away ail her jewels and her pretty  dress, and gave her a rough cotton frock, wooden shoes,  and a little cloth cap. There was some straw in a  corner, which was all she had for a bed, and they gave  her a very little bit of black bread to eat. In this mis- "</paragraph>

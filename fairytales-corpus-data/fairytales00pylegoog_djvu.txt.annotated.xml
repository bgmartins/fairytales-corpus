	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>|HERE have Folk-Tales had their begin-  ning? Philologists are inclined to the  belief that to answer such a question one  must look far into the depths of a Past  more remote than^ that of ancient Egypt, more pro-  found than that of Nineveh and Babylon  z dim,  impenetrable Past where at the primitive fireside of  Humanity, the stories of the slayers of the Giants and  of the Hero who rescues the enchanted Princess from  her perils were told to listening audiences of the  adult children of a race yet infant in its simplicity.  Folk-Tales are as universal as human speech, and,  as one language differing from another had, after all,  its beginning in a single parent stock of vowels and  consonants articulated into speech, so the folk-tales of  one people differ from another only in a degree lim-  ited by circumstances and surroundings. For there  is no mistaking the significance of the fact that each  group of these quaint and curious Romances is so  similar in its variants that it is hardly^possible to sup-  pose otherwise than that all grew originally from one  parent root founded in the very fundamental begin-  ning of human imagination.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>of folk-tales have even arranged the thousands of dif-  ferent forms into some score or less of general types,  and these again may be condensed into a third or a  quarter as many species. Indeed, when the final test  is applied, all may be resolved down into the one uni-  versal theme  perhaps the struggle between light  and darkness; perhaps the conflict between summer  and winter; perhaps (and this seems more likely)  that ceaseless striving of good against evil, of weak-  ness against oppression, of simplicity against cun-  ning, of innocence against cruelty, that was since the  world began.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>Let us take, for example, a very universal type of  story in which three brothers are called upon to un-  dertake some miraculous task, the reward in the suc-  cessful performance of which is to be the possession  of the beautiful Princess and of half the kingdom.  (The story rarely deviates from the statement that, of  these three brothers, two are wise and reputable,  strong and valiant; the third  always the youngest   being held by all the world to be a mere stupid wit-  less oaf. He sits at home grubbing amid the dust  and ashes, whilst his brothers go about in fine clothes  and at ease. He is kicked and cuffed from pillar to  post, and the refuse of the house is thrown to him to  eat as it might be thrown to a mangy dog. The two  elder brothers embark upon the performance of the  adventure  jubilant, joyous, confident of success.  rThey return beaten, humiliated, overthrown. Then</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>This type of folk-tale belongs to every race of  people and to every nation in the world; it extends  from the farthest bounds of Scandinavia to the utter-  most part of India. The variants upon the theme  are innumeraixle, but the theme itself is as universal  as the words of human speech. It is impossible not  to believe that it holds within it some mysterious sig-  nificance that appertains to the very psychical exist-*  ence of humanity. Were it otherwise it would long  since have been dissipated and vanished into forget-  fulness instead of being repeated and varied into a  hundred languages and a diousand differentiated  forms.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='109'>Another type of story, favorite with all peoples, is  that of the clever thief who, by cunning and inge-  nuity, circumvents the entire cumbrous machinery of  established law and order.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='110'>This type of story exists, not only in the folk-tales  of Germany and Scandinavia, of the Scottish High-  lands and the plains of southern Europe, but it ap-  pears with a singular identity of form in a folk-tale  transcribed by the collector of certain North Ameri-  can Indian myths. It is recounted, not only at the  firesides of to-day, but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='priest;to-day;fireside;legend' adjectives='great;ancient;dead' verbs='be;forget;tell;have;recount' valence='5.46333333333' arousal='4.11466666667' dominance='5.23866666667'>Herodotus</entity> had it, he tells us,  from the priests of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='priest;to-day;fireside;legend' adjectives='great;ancient;dead' verbs='be;forget;tell;have;recount' valence='5.46333333333' arousal='4.11466666667' dominance='5.23866666667'>Egypt</entity> as an ancient legend of  dead and forgotten days of great Pharaohs of the  past.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='123'>Sometimes the simple folk-story tells of an en-  chanted Princess who lies entranced for a hundred  years until the expected hero appears to waken her;  sometimes the hero or the heroine dies and the soul  reappears in the form of an animal until, by means of  some peculiar charm or mystic ceremony, it is rein-  carnated in the original human body; sometimes the  hero of the narrative is slain by the villain, and is re-  vived by some faithful friend or animal companion,  who brings to him the Water of Life or the Fruit of  Life from the uttermost extremity of the earth ; some-  times it is a great King or a great Hero who had gone  from the world only for a little while, leaving behind  him a promise that, by and by, he shall return and  bring peace and happiness, hope and comfort, to the  lowly and oppressed.

The thunder epics of in-  numerable dead poets have rumbled away into si-  lence of eternity; only huge fragments of Homer and  of Aeschylus remain to us of the present day; but  those quaint, simple, childish narratives, told at the  fireside, existing only as they have been passed from  lip to lip, have reached us unbroken  almost un-  changed in their very diction  from the very begin-  nings of human speech. So, likewise, they shall  doubtless last as long as this ancient world shall throb  with human life.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='190'>ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen  who loved each other so much that they were  never happy unless they were together. Day after day  they went out hundng or fishing ; night after night they  went to balls or to the opera ; they sang, and danced,  and ate sugar-plums, and were the gayest of the gay, and  all their subjects followed their example so that the king-  dom was called the Joyous Land. Now in the next  kingdom everything was as different as it could possibly  be. The King was sulky and savage, and never enjoyed  himself at all. He looked so ugly and cross that all his  subjects feared him, and he hated the very sight of a  cheerful face ; so if he ever caught any one smiling he  had his head cut off that very minute. This kingdom  was very appropriately called the Land of Tears. Now  when this wicked King heard of the happiness of the  Jolly King, he was so jealous that he collected a great  army and set out to fight him, and the news of his ap-  proach was soon brought to the King and Queen. The  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;hear;frighten' valence='5.4575' arousal='4.4275' dominance='5.325'>Queen</entity>, when she heard of it, was frightened out of her</paragraph>

The Fairy,  who had set her mind upon securing their happiness, had  in their absence quite made up the quarrel between their  parents, and gained their consent to the marriage of the  faithful lovers ; and now she conducted them to the most  charming little cottage that can be imagined, close to the  fountain, which had once more resumed its peaceful  aspect, and flowed gently down into the little brook  which inclosed the garden and orchard and pasture  which belonged to the cottage. Indeed, nothing more  could have been thought of, either for Sylvain and Jocosa  or for their flocks ; and their delight satisfied even the  Fairy who had planned it all to please them.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1651'>Once upon a time a Fairy, who had somehow or  other got into mischief, was condemned by the High  Court of Fairyland to live for several years under the  form of some creature, and at the moment of resuming  her natural appearance once again to make the fortune  of two men. It was left to her to choose what form she  would take, and because she loved yellow she trans-  formed herself into a lovely bird with shining golden  feathers such as no one had ever seen before. When the  time of her punishment was at an end the beautiful yel-  low bird flew to Bagdad, and let herself be caught by  a Fowler at the precise moment when Badi-al-Zaman  was walking up and down outside his magnificent sum-  mer palace. This Badi-al-Zaman  whose name means  " Wonder-of-the- World "  was looked upon in Bagdad  as the most fortunate creature under the sun, because of  his vast wealth. But really, what with anxiety about his  riches and being weary of everything, and always desir-  ing something he had not, he never knew a moment"s  real happiness. Even now he had come out of his palace,  which was large and splendid enough for fifty kings,  weary and cross because he could find nothing new to  amuse him. The Fowler thought that this would be a  favorable opportunity for ofifering him the marvellous  bird, which he felt certain he would buy the instant he  saw it. And he was not mistaken, for when Badi-al-  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='prisoner;hand' adjectives='own;lovely;badi-al;mistaken' verbs='be;take' valence='5.424' arousal='4.176' dominance='5.0'>Zaman</entity> took the lovely prisoner into his own hands, he</paragraph>

In spite of all his  wealth he at once began to desire the promised gold, and  the bargain was soon completed. Then the difficulty  arose as to how the bird was to be cooked ; for among all  his army of servants not one could Badi-al-Zaman trust.  At last he asked the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;wife;bird;hearing' adjectives='last' verbs='be;bid;marry;cook;take;ask;tell' valence='6.24545454545' arousal='4.03545454545' dominance='5.70909090909'>Fowler</entity> if he were married, and on  hearing that he was he bade him take the bird home with  him and tell his wife to cook it.</paragraph>

She was so terrified that she fell  upon her knees before him and confessed that her two  children had come in just before he arrived, and had so  teased her for some of the dish she was preparing that  she had presently given the head to one and the heart  to the other, since these morsels are not generally much  esteemed ; and Badi-al-Zaman rushed from the cottage  vowing vengeance against the whole family.

Soon, however, they came  to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank  they did not know how they were to get over it. The  straw hit on a good idea, and said, ^* I will lay myself  straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on  a bridge." The straw therefore stretched itself from one  bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetu-  ous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly  built bridge. But when she had reached the middle,  and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was, after  all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no further. The  straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and  fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed  when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The  bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore,  could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop,  and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would have  been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a  tailor who was travelling in search of work had not sat  down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate  heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her  together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as  the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a  black seam.</paragraph>

The young journeymen thought^ ""With  this thou hast enough for thy whole life," and went joy-  ously about the world and never troubled himself at all  whether an inn was good or bad, or if anything was to be  found in it or not. When it suited him he did not enter  an inn at all, but either in the plain, in a wood, a meadow,  or whenever he fancied, he took his table off his back, set  it down before him, and said, "" Cover thyself," and then  everything appeared that his heart desired. At length  he took it into his head to go back to his father, whose  anger would now be appeased, and who would now will-  ingly receive him with his wishing-table. It came to pass  that on his way home, he came one evening to an inn  which was filled with guests. They bade him wel-  come, and invited him to sit and eat with them, for  otherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything.  " No," answered the joiner, " I will not take the  few bites out of your mouths ; rather than that, you  shall be my guests." They laughed, and thought he  was jesting with them ; he, however, placed his wooden  table in the middle of the room, and said, " Little table,  cover thyself." Instantly it was covered with food, so  good that the host could never have procured it, and the  smell of it ascended pleasantly to the nostrils of the  guests. " Fall to, dear friends," said the joiner ; and the  guests when they saw that he meant it, did not need to  be asked twice, but drew near, pulled out their knives and  attacked it valiantly.

The  joiner and his comrades made merry until late into the  night ; at length they lay down to sleep, and the young  apprentice also went to bed, and set his magic table  against the wall. The host"s thoughts, however, let him  have no rest ; it occurred to him that there was a little  old table in his lumber-room, which looked just like the  apprentice"s, and he brought it out quite softly, and ex-  changed it for the wishing-table. Next morning, the  joiner paid for his bed, took up his table, never thinking  that he had got a false one, and went his way. At mid-  day he reached his father, who received him with great  joy. " Well, my dear son, what hast thou learned ? "  ssud he to him. ^* Father, I have become a joiner."</paragraph>

The relations, however,  mocked him, and were forced to go home without hav-  ing eaten or drunk.

It came to pass that he came to the  same public-house in which his brother"s table had been  exchanged.

This  struck the host as odd, and he thought that a man who  was forced to look after his ass himself, could not have  much to spend ; but when the stranger put his hand in  his pocket and brought out two gold pieces, and said he  was to provide something good for him, the host opened  his eyes wide, and ran and sought out the best he could  muster.</paragraph>

The host could not imagine what this could mean, and  4&gt;eing curious, stole after him, and as the guest bolted the  stable door, he peeped through a hole left by a knot in  the wood. The stranger spread out the cloth under the  animal and cried, "^ Bricklebrit," and immediately the beast  began to let gold pieces fall, so that it fairly rained down  money on the ground.

" What hast thou made of thy-  self, my son?" asked the old man. *"A miller, dear  father," he answered. "" What hast thou brought back  with thee from thy travels ? " Nothing else but an ass."  "" There are asses enough here," said the Either, "^ I would  rather have had a good goat." " Yes," replied the son,  "^ but it is no common ass, but a gold-ass ; when 1 say  * Bricklebrit," the good beast opens its mouth and drops  a whole sheetful of gold pieces. Just summon all our  relations hither, and I will make them rich folks."

As soon  as they were assembled, the miller bade them make way,  spread out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room.  " Now watch," said he, and cried, " Bricklebrit," but no  gold pieces fell, and it was clear that the animal knew  nothing of the art, for every ass does not attain such  perfection. Then the poor miller pulled a long &amp;ce, saw  that he was betrayed, and begged pardon of the relatives,  who went home as poor as they came. There was no  help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle  once more, and the youth hired himself to a miller.</paragraph>

One of  these fell westward, over the face of a crag so high that,  when the sun had set to everything else, and all below  was darkness, his beams still shone full upon this water-  fall, so that it looked like a shower of gold. It was  therefore called by the people of the neighborhood the  Golden River. It was strange that none of these streams  fell into the valley itself.

They  lived by farming the Treasure Valley, and very good  farmers they were. They killed everything that did not  pay for its eating.

After the momentous visit above related, he entered the  Treasure Valley no more ; and, what was worse, he had  so much influence with his relations, the West Winds in  general, and used it so eflfectually, that they all adopted  a similar line of conduct. So no rain fell in the valley  from one year"s end to another. Though everything re-  mained green and flourishing in the plains below, the in-  heritance of the Three Brothers was a desert. What had  once been the richest soil in the kingdom became a shifting  heap of red sand ; and the brothers, unable longer to con-  tend with the adverse skies, abandoned their valueless  patrimony in despair, to seek some means of gaining a  livelihood among the cities and people of the plains.  All their money was gone, and they had nothing left but  some curious, old-fashioned pieces of gold plate, the last  remnants of their ill-gotten wealth.</paragraph>

But two slight  circumstances affected their trade : the firsts that people  did not approve of the coppered gold ; the second, that  the two elder brothers, whenever they had sold anything,  used to leave little Gluck to mind the furnace, and go  and drink out the money in the ale-house next door. So  they melted all their gold, without making money enough  to buy more, and were at last reduced to one large drink-  ing-mug, which an uncle of his had given to little Gluck^  and which he was very fond of, and would not have  parted with for the world ; though he never drank any-  thing out of it but milk and water. The mug was a very  odd mug to look at. The handle was formed of two  wreaths of flowing golden hair, so finely spun that it  looked more like silk than like metal, and these wreaths  descended into, and mixed with, a beard and whiskers,  of the same exquisite workmanship, which surrounded  and decorated a very fierce little face, of the reddest gold  imaginable, right in the front of the mug, with a pair of  eyes in it which seemed to command its whole circum-  ference. It was impossible to drink out of the mug  without being subjected to an intense gaze out of the  side of these eyes ; and Schwartz positively averred that  once, after emptying it full of Rhenish seventeen times,  he had seen them wink !

It was singing now very merrily " Lala-lira-la " ; no  words, only a soft running effervescent melody, some-  thing like that of a kettle on the boil. Gluck looked  out of the window. No, it was certainly in the house.  Upstairs, and downstairs. No, it was certainly in that  very room, coming in quicker time and clearer notes  every moment. " Lala-lira-la." All at once it struck  Gluck that it sounded louder near the furnace.

He was dressed in a slashed doublet of spun gold, so fine  in its texture that the prismatic colors gleamed over it, as  if on a surface of mother-of-pearl ; and over this brilliant  doublet his hair and beard fell full half-way to the ground,  in waving curls, so exquisitely delicate that Gluck could  hardly tell where they ended ; they seemed to melt into  air. The features of the face, however, were by no means  finished with the same delicacy ; they were rather coarse,  slightly inclining to coppery in complexion, and indica-  tive, in expression, of a very pertinacious and intractable  disposition in their small proprietor.

When the time came for her to be married, and  she had to journey forth into the distant kingdom, the  aged Queen packed up for her many costly vessels of  silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver ; and  cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained  to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her  heart. She likewise sent her maid in waiting, who was  to ride with her, and hand her over to the bridegroom,  and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of  the King"s daughter was called Falada, and could speak.  So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother  went into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her  finger with it until it bled, then she held a white hand-  herchief to it into which she let three drops of blood fall,  gave it to her daughter and said, ^^ Dear child, preserve  this carefully, it will be of service to you on your way."</paragraph>

So in  her great thirst the princess alighted, bent down over the  water in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to  drink out of the golden cup. Then she said, "^ Ah,  Heaven !

She rode some miles further, but the  day was warm, the sun scorched her, and she was thirsty  once more, and when they came to a stream of water, she  again cried to her waiting-maid, ^^ Dismount, and give  me some water in my golden cup," for she had long ago  forgotten the girl"s ill words.

Then the wait-  ing-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess ex-  change her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes;  and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear  sky above her, that she would not say one word of this  to any one at the royal court, and if she had not taken  this oath she would have been killed on the spot.

Then the old King looked out of the  window and saw her standing in the courtyard, and how  dainty and delicate and beautiful she was, and instantly  went to the royal apartment, and asked the bride about  the girl she had with her who was standing down below  in the courtyard, and who she was ? ^^ I picked her up  on my way for a compamon ; give the girl something to  work at, that she may not stand idle."

" Then send for  the knacker, and have the head of the horse on which I  rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way." In  reality, she was afraid that the horse might tell how she  had behaved to the King"s daughter. Then she succeeded  in making the King promise that it should be done, and  the faithful Falada was to die ; this came to the ears of  the real princess, and she secretly promised to pay the  knacker a piece of gold if he would perform a small ser-  vice for her. There was a great dark-looking gateway in  the town, through which morning and evening she had  to pass with the geese : would he be so good as to  nail up Falada"s head on it, so that she might see him  again, more than once.

The old man led him back into the  castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of  gold. " Of these," said he, " one part is for the poor,</paragraph>

In the  meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared ;  the youth, therefore, was left in darkness. *^ I shall still  be able to find my way out," said he, and felt about,  found the way into the room^ and slept there by his fire.  Next morning the King came and said, ** Now thou must  have learned what shuddering is ? " " No," he answered ;  ^^what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a  bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money  down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder."  " Then," said the King, " thou hast delivered the castle,  and shalt marry my daughter." " That is all very well,"  said he, "* but still I do not know what it is to shudder ! "  Then the gold was brought up and the wedding cele^  brated ; but howsoever much the young King loved his  wife, and however happy he was, he still said always, "^ If  I could but shudder  if I could but shudder." And at  hrst she was angry at this. Her waiting-maid said, ^^ I  will find a cure for him ; he shall soon learn what it is to  shudder." She went out to the stream which flowed  through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gud-  geons brought to her. At night when the young King  was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him and  empty the bucketful of cold water with the gudgeons in  it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about  him. When this was done, he woke up and cried, " Oh,  what makes me shudder so ?  what makes me shudder  so, dear wife ? Ah ! now I know what it is to shudder 1 "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3880'>li/I ANY years ago there lived an Emperor who was so  ^^^ fond of new clothes that he spent all his money  on them in order to be beautifully dressed. He did not  care about his soldiers, he did not care about the theatre ;  he only liked to go out walking to show off his new  clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day ;  and just as they say of a king, ^" He is in the council-  chamber," they always said here, " The Emperor is in  the wardrobe."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3881'>In the great city in which he lived there was always  something going on ; every day many strangers came  there. One day two impostors arrived who gave them-  selves out as weavers, and said that they knew how to  manufacture the most beautiful cloth imaginable. Not  only were the texture and pattern uncommonly beauti-  ful, but the clothes which were made of the stuff pos-  sessed this wonderful property that they were invisible to  any one who was not fit for his office, or who was unpar-  donably stupid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3882'>** Those must indeed be splendid clothes," thought  the Emperor. "^ If I had them on I could find out which  men in my kingdom are unfit for the offices they hold ;  I could distinguish the wise from the stupid ! Yes, this</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3887'>They placed two weaving-looms, and began to do as  if they were working, but they had not the least thing on  the looms. They also demanded the finest silk and the  best gold, which they put in their pockets, and worked  at the empty looms till late into the night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3888'>" I should like very much to know how far they have  got on with the cloth," thought the Emperor. But he  remembered when he thought about it that whoever was  stupid or not fit for his oflice would not be able to see it.  Now he certainly believed that he had nothing to fear  for himself, but he wanted first to send somebody else  in order to see how he stood with regard to his ofiice.  Everybody in the whole town knew what a wonderful  power the cloth had, and they were all curious to see  how bad or how stupid their neighbor was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3889'>^"I will send my old and honored minister to the  weavers," thought the Emperor. " He can judge best  what the cloth is like, for he has intellect, and no one  understands his oflice better than he."</paragraph>

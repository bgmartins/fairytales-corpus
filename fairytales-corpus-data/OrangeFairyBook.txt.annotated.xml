	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='5'>The children who read fairy books, or have fairy books read to them, do not read prefaces, and the parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who give fairy books to their daughters, nieces, and cousines, leave prefaces unread.  For whom, then, are prefaces written?  When an author publishes a book "out of his own head," he writes the preface for his own pleasure.  After reading over his book in print--to make sure that all the "u"s" are not printed as "n"s," and all the "n"s" as "u"s" in the proper names--then the author says, mildly, in his preface, what he thinks about his own book, and what he means it to prove--if he means it to prove anything--and why it is not a better book than it is.  But, perhaps, nobody reads prefaces except other authors; and critics, who hope that they will find enough in the preface to enable them to do without reading any of the book.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='6'>This appears to be the philosophy of prefaces in general, and perhaps authors might be more daring and candid than they are with advantage, and write regular criticisms of their own books in their prefaces, for nobody can be so good a critic of himself as the author--if he has a sense of humour.  If he has not, the less he says in his preface the better.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='7'>These Fairy Books, however, are not written by the Editor, as he has often explained, "out of his own head."  The stories are taken from those told by grannies to grandchildren in many countries and in many languages-- French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Gaelic, Icelandic, Cherokee, African, Indian, Australian, Slavonic, Eskimo, and what not. The stories are not literal, or word by word translations, but have been altered in many ways to make them suitable for children.  Much has been left out in places, and the narrative has been broken up into conversations, the characters telling each other how matters stand, and speaking for themselves, as children, and some older people, prefer them to do.  In many tales, fairly cruel and savage deeds are done, and these have been softened down as much as possible; though it is impossible, even if it were desirable, to conceal the circumstance that popular stories were never intended to be tracts and nothing else. Though they usually take the side of courage and kindness, and the virtues in general, the old story-tellers admire successful cunning as much as Homer does in the Odyssey.  At least, if the cunning hero, human or animal, is the weaker, like Odysseus, Brer Rabbit, and many others, the story-teller sees little in intellect but superior cunning, by which tiny Jack gets the better of the giants.  In the fairy tales of no country are "improper" incidents common, which is to the credit of human nature, as they were obviously composed mainly for children. It is not difficult to get rid of this element when it does occur in popular tales.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='8'>The old puzzle remains a puzzle--why do the stories of the remotest people so closely resemble each other?  Of course, in the immeasurable past, they have been carried about by conquering races, and learned by conquering races from vanquished peoples.  Slaves carried far from home brought their stories with them into captivity.  Wanderers, travellers, shipwrecked men, merchants, and wives stolen from alien tribes have diffused the stories; gipsies and Jews have passed them about; Roman soldiers of many different races, moved here and there about the Empire, have trafficked in them.  From the remotest days men have been wanderers, and wherever they went their stories accompanied them.  The slave trade might take a Greek to Persia, a Persian to Greece; an Egyptian woman to Phoenicia; a Babylonian to Egypt; a Scandinavian child might be carried with the amber from the Baltic to the Adriatic; or a Sidonian to Ophir, wherever Ophir may have been; while the Portuguese may have borne their tales to South Africa, or to Asia, and thence brought back other tales to Egypt.  The stories wandered wherever the Buddhist missionaries went, and the earliest French voyageurs told them to the Red Indians.  These facts help to account for the sameness of the stories everywhere;  and the uniformity of human fancy in early societies must be the cause of many other resemblances.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='359'>At the foot of some high mountains there was, once upon a time, a small village, and a little way off two roads met, one of them going to the east and the other to the west.  The villagers were quiet, hard-working folk, who toiled in the fields all day, and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church.  In the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture, and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='360'>One summer night, when a round full moon shone down upon the white road, a great wolf came trotting round the corner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='361'>"I positively must get a good meal before I go back to my den," he said to himself; "it is nearly a week since I have tasted anything but scraps, though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure!  Of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains; but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them, and I am not so young as I was!  If I could only dine off that fox I saw a fortnight ago, curled up into a delicious hairy ball, I should ask nothing better; I would have eaten her then, but unluckily her husband was lying beside her, and one knows that foxes, great and small, run like the wind. Really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf, and, as the proverb says: "One wolf does not bite another." However, let us see what this village can produce.  I am as hungry as a schoolmaster."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='362'>Now, while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf, the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='363'>"The whole of this day I have listened to those village hens clucking till I could bear it no longer," murmured she as she bounded along, hardly seeming to touch the ground.  "When you are fond of fowls and eggs it is the sweetest of all music.  As sure as there is a sun in heaven I will have some of them this night, for I have grown so thin that my very bones rattle, and my poor babies are crying for food." And as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass, where the two roads joined, and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest, and to settle her plans.  At this moment the wolf came up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='364'>At the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water, but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was.  The fox"s quick ears heard the sound of his paws, though they were soft as velvet, and turning her head she said politely:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>"Is that you, neighbour?  What a strange place to meet in!  I hope you are quite well?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>"Quite well as regards my health," answered the wolf, whose eye glistened greedily, "at least, as well as one can be when one is very hungry.  But what is the matter with you?  A fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='367'>"I have been ill--very ill," replied the fox, "and what you say is quite true.  A worm is fat in comparison with me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='368'>"He is.  Still, you are good enough for me; for "to the hungry no bread is hard.""</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='369'>"Oh, you are always joking!  I"m sure you are not half as hungry as I!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='370'>"That we shall soon see," cried the wolf, opening his huge mouth and crouching for a spring.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='371'>"What are you doing?" exclaimed the fox, stepping backwards.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='372'>"What am I doing?  What I am going to do is to make my supper off you, in less time than a cock takes to crow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='373'>"Well, I suppose you must have your joke," answered the fox lightly, but never removing her eye from the wolf, who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='374'>"I don"t want to joke, but to eat!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='375'>"But surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='376'>"In this world the cleverest people are always the hungriest," replied the wolf.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='377'>"Ah! how true that is; but--"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='378'>"I can"t stop to listen to your "buts" and "yets,"" broke in the wolf rudely; "let us get to the point, and the point is that I want to eat you and not talk to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='379'>"Have you no pity for a poor mother?" asked the fox, putting her tail to her eyes, but peeping slily out of them all the same.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>"I am dying of hunger," answered the wolf, doggedly; "and you know," he added with a grin, "that charity begins at home."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='381'>"Quite so," replied the fox; "it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense.  But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='382'>"Then be quick and don"t waste my time, for I can"t wait much longer. What is it you want?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='383'>"You must know," said the fox, "that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard.  By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water.  For many nights I have crept down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children.  All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='384'>"But the cheeses may be all finished by now?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='385'>"If you were only to see the quantities of them!" laughed the fox. "And even if they were finished, there would always be ME to eat."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='386'>"Well, I will come.  Lead <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='trick;host;leg' adjectives='lead' verbs='try;play;be;reckon;warn;say;escape' valence='5.748' arousal='4.022' dominance='5.42'>the way</entity>, but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host-- that is to say, without my legs, which are as long as yours!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>All was silent in the village, and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon, which shone bright and clear in the sky.  The wolf and the fox crept softly along, when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other; a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses, and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs, who began to bark greedily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='388'>"Is it safe to go on, think you?" asked the wolf in a whisper.  And the fox shook her head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='389'>"Not while the dogs are barking," said she; "someone might come out to see if anything was the matter."  And she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='390'>In about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking, or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them.  Then the wolf and the fox jumped up, and hastened to the foot of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foot;fox;wolf' adjectives='' verbs='jump;hasten' valence='5.47666666667' arousal='4.04666666667' dominance='5.22166666667'>the wall</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='391'>"I am lighter than he is," thought the fox to herself, "and perhaps if I make haste I can get a start, and jump over the wall on the other side before he manages to spring over this one."  And she quickened her pace.  But if the wolf could not run he could jump, and with one bound he was beside his companion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='392'>"What were you going to do, comrade?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='393'>"Oh, nothing," replied the fox, much vexed at the failure of her plan.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='394'>"I think if I were to take a bit out of your haunch you would jump better," said the wolf, giving a snap at her as he spoke.  The fox drew back uneasily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='395'>"Be careful, or I shall scream," she snarled.  And the wolf, understanding all that might happen if the fox carried out her threat, gave a signal to his companion to leap on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fox;signal;wolf;threat;companion' adjectives='' verbs='give;leap;understand;carry;follow;happen' valence='5.58846153846' arousal='4.19307692308' dominance='5.36076923077'>the wall</entity>, where he immediately followed her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='396'>Once on the top they crouched down and looked about them.  Not a creature was to be seen in the courtyard, and in the furthest corner from the house stood the well, with its two buckets suspended from a pole, just as the fox had described it.  The two thieves dragged themselves noiselessly along <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='neck;bottom;fox;thief;moon;water;round' adjectives='big;little;able;yellow;opposite' verbs='be;stretch;make;reflect;drag;go' valence='5.60130434783' arousal='3.81782608696' dominance='5.40217391304'>the wall</entity> till they were opposite <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='neck;bottom;fox;thief;moon;water;round' adjectives='big;little;able;yellow;opposite' verbs='be;stretch;make;reflect;drag;go' valence='5.60130434783' arousal='3.81782608696' dominance='5.40217391304'>the well</entity>, and by stretching out her neck as far as it would go the fox was able to make out that there was only very little water in the bottom, but just enough to reflect the moon, big, and round and yellow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='397'>"How lucky!" cried she to the wolf.  "There is a huge cheese about the size of a mill wheel.  Look! look! did you ever see anything so beautiful!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>"Never!" answered the wolf, peering over in his turn, his eyes glistening greedily, for he imagined that the moon"s reflection in the water was really a cheese.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='399'>"And now, unbeliever, what have you to say?" and the fox laughed gently.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='400'>"That you are a woman--I mean a fox--of your word," replied the wolf.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='401'>"Well, then, go down in that bucket and eat your fill," said the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='402'>"Oh, is that your game?" asked the wolf, with a grin.  "No! no!  The person who goes down in the bucket will be you!  And if you don"t go down your head will go without you!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='403'>"Of course I will go down, with the greatest pleasure," answered the fox, who had expected the wolf"s reply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='404'>"And be sure you don"t eat all the cheese, or it will be the worse for you," continued the wolf.  But the fox looked up at him with tears in her eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='405'>"Farewell, suspicious one!" she said sadly.  And climbed into the bucket.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='406'>In an instant she had reached the bottom of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;leg;bottom' adjectives='enough;instant;deep' verbs='cover;be;reach;find;have' valence='5.72454545455' arousal='3.67818181818' dominance='5.47090909091'>the well</entity>, and found that the water was not deep enough to cover her legs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='407'>"Why, it is larger and richer than I thought," cried she, turning towards the wolf, who was leaning over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wolf' adjectives='larger;richer' verbs='be;cry;lean;think;turn' valence='5.60666666667' arousal='4.04666666667' dominance='5.02666666667'>the wall</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wolf' adjectives='larger;richer' verbs='be;cry;lean;think;turn' valence='5.60666666667' arousal='4.04666666667' dominance='5.02666666667'>the well</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='408'>"Then be quick and bring it up," commanded the wolf.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='409'>"How can I, when it weighs more than I do?" asked the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='410'>"If it is so heavy bring it in two bits, of course," said he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='411'>"But I have no knife," answered the fox.  "You will have to come down yourself, and we will carry it up between us."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='412'>"And how am I to come down?" inquired the wolf.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='413'>"Oh, you are really very stupid!  Get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='414'>The wolf looked up, and saw the bucket hanging there, and with some difficulty he climbed into it.  As he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk, and the other bucket, in which the fox was seated, came to the surface.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='415'>As soon as he understood what was happening, the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf, but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='416'>"But where is the cheese?" he asked of the fox, who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='417'>"The cheese?" answered the fox; "why I am taking it home to my babies, who are too young to get food for themselves."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='418'>"Ah, traitor!" cried the wolf, howling with rage.  But the fox was not there to hear this insult, for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl-house, where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='419'>"Perhaps I did treat him rather badly," she said to herself.  "But it seems getting cloudy, and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom, and his will go up--at least it may!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='425'>Long ago a king and queen ruled over the islands of the west, and they had one son, whom they loved dearly.  The boy grew up to be tall and strong and handsome, and he could run and shoot, and swim and dive better than any lad of his own age in the country.  Besides, he knew how to sail about, and sing songs to the harp, and during the winter evenings, when everyone was gathered round the huge hall fire shaping bows or weaving cloth, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everyone;song;fire;father;hall;tale;cloth;deed;bow;round;harp' adjectives='huge' verbs='be;sail;gather;shape;know;sing;tell;weave' valence='6.03818181818' arousal='3.53954545455' dominance='5.61545454545'>Ian Direach</entity> would tell them tales of the deeds of his fathers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='426'>So the time slipped by till Ian was almost a man, as they reckoned men in those days, and then his mother the queen died.  There was great mourning throughout all the isles, and the boy and his father mourned her bitterly also; but before the new year came the king had married another wife, and seemed to have forgotten his old one.  Only <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='remember' valence='6.5' arousal='3.14' dominance='6.31'>Ian</entity> remembered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='427'>On a morning when the leaves were yellow in the trees of the glen, Ian slung his bow over his shoulder, and filling his quiver with arrows, went on to the hill in search of game.  But not a bird was to be seen anywhere, till at length a blue falcon flew past him, and raising his bow he took aim at her.  His eye was straight and his hand steady, but the falcon"s flight was swift, and he only shot a feather from her wing.  As the sun was now low over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sun;feather;game;bag' adjectives='low' verbs='put;be;set' valence='5.83444444444' arousal='3.53444444444' dominance='5.33222222222'>the sea</entity> he put the feather in his game bag, and set out homewards.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='428'>"Have you brought me much game to-day?" asked his stepmother as he entered <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stepmother' adjectives='' verbs='ask;enter' valence='5.4' arousal='3.51' dominance='5.3675'>the hall</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='429'>"Nought save this," he answered, handing her the feather of the blue falcon, which she held by the tip and gazed at silently.  Then she turned to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='turn;say' valence='5.68' arousal='3.955' dominance='6.38'>Ian</entity> and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='430'>"I am setting it on you as crosses and as spells, and as the fall of the year!  That you may always be cold, and wet and dirty, and that your shoes may ever have pools in them, till you bring me hither the blue falcon on which that feather grew."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='431'>"If it is spells you are laying I can lay them too," answered Ian Direach; "and you shall stand with one foot on the great house and another on the castle, till I come back again, and your face shall be to the wind, from wheresoever it shall blow."  Then he went away to seek the bird, as his stepmother bade him; and, looking homewards from the hill, he saw <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='standing;stepmother;house;face;tempest;hill;foot;bird' adjectives='great;other' verbs='blow;look;bid;turn;see;go;seek' valence='5.78473684211' arousal='3.99789473684' dominance='5.74473684211'>the queen</entity> standing with one foot on the great house, and the other on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='standing;stepmother;house;face;tempest;hill;foot;bird' adjectives='great;other' verbs='blow;look;bid;turn;see;go;seek' valence='5.78473684211' arousal='3.99789473684' dominance='5.74473684211'>the castle</entity>, and her face turned towards whatever tempest should blow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='432'>On he journeyed, over hills, and through rivers till he reached a wide plain, and never a glimpse did he catch of the falcon.  Darker and darker it grew, and the small birds were seeking their nests, and at length Ian Direach could see no more, and he lay down under some bushes and sleep came to him.  And in his dream a soft nose touched him, and a warm body curled up beside him, and a low voice whispered to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='433'>"Fortune is against you, Ian Direach; I have but the cheek and the hoof of a sheep to give you, and with these you must be content."

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='442'>So Ian Direach entered, and tended so well and carefully all the birds and beasts, that the giant was better satisfied than ever he had been, and at length he thought that he might even be trusted to feed the falcon.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='444'>Scarcely was the giant out of sight next morning when Ian Direach seized the falcon, and throwing a cloth over her head hastened with her to the door.  But the rays of the sun pierced through the thickness of the cloth, and as they passed the doorpost she gave a spring, and the tip of one of her feathers touched the post, which gave a scream, and brought the giant back in three strides.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='see;tremble;say' valence='4.665' arousal='4.7575' dominance='5.505'>Ian Direach</entity> trembled as he saw him; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='see;tremble;say' valence='4.665' arousal='4.7575' dominance='5.505'>the giant</entity> only said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='447'>"Ah, that is for you to discover."  And Ian dared say no more, and hastened down to the waste.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='483'>So well content was the giant to possess the sword he had coveted for many a year, that he began at once to whirl it through the air, and to cut and slash with it.  For a little while Gille Mairtean let the giant play with him in this manner; then he turned in the giant"s hand, and cut through the Five Necks, so that the Five Heads rolled on the ground.  Afterwards he went back to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='go;say' valence='5.66333333333' arousal='3.96' dominance='5.81'>Ian Direach</entity> and said to him:</paragraph>

But see that the back of the sword is ever against your nose, else when your stepmother beholds you, she will change you into a dry faggot.  If, however, you do as I bid you, she will become herself a bundle of sticks."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='485'>Ian Direach hearkened to the words of Gille Mairtean, and his stepmother fell as a bundle of sticks before him; and he set fire to her, and was free from her spells for ever.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='486'>And Ian Direach knew that all this he owed to Gille Mairtean the fox, and he made a compact with him that he might choose any beast out of his herds, whenever hunger seized him, and that henceforth no arrow should be let fly at him or at any of his race.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='491'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='492'>It was summer in the land of Denmark, and though for most of the year the country looks flat and ugly, it was beautiful now.  The wheat was yellow, the oats were green, the hay was dry and delicious to roll in, and from the old ruined house which nobody lived in, down to the edge of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wheat;burdock;family;oats;house;nobody;hay;edge;forest;child' adjectives='dry;great;old;yellow;green;delicious;tall;whole' verbs='be;ruin;find;live;have;dwell;roll' valence='5.85566666667' arousal='4.011' dominance='5.65'>the canal</entity>, was a forest of great burdocks, so tall that a whole family of children might have dwelt in them and never have been found out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='493'>It was under these burdocks that a duck had built herself a warm nest, and was not sitting all day on six pretty eggs.  Five of them were white, but the sixth, which was larger than the others, was of an ugly grey colour.  The duck was always puzzled about that egg, and how it came to be so different from the rest.  Other birds might have thought that when the duck went down in the morning and evening to the water to stretch her legs in a good swim, some lazy mother might have been on the watch, and have popped her egg into the nest.  But ducks are not clever at all, and are not quick at counting, so this duck did not worry herself about the matter, but just took care that the big egg should be as warm as the rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='494'>This was the first set of eggs that the duck had ever laid, and, to begin with, she was very pleased and proud, and laughed at the other mothers, who were always neglecting their duties to gossip with each other or to take little extra swims besides the two in the morning and evening that were necessary for health.  But at length she grew tired of sitting there all day.  "Surely eggs take longer hatching than they did," she said to herself; and she pined for a little amusement also. Still, she knew that if she left her eggs and the ducklings in them to die none of her friends would ever speak to her again; so there she stayed, only getting off the eggs several times a day to see if the shells were cracking--which may have been the very reason why they did not crack sooner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='495'>She had looked at the eggs at least a hundred and fifty times, when, to her joy, she saw a tiny crack on two of them, and scrambling back to the nest she drew the eggs closer the one to the other, and never moved for the whole of that day.  Next morning she was rewarded by noticing cracks in the whole five eggs, and by midday two little yellow heads were poking out from the shells.  This encouraged her so much that, after breaking the shells with her bill, so that the little creatures could get free of them, she sat steadily for a whole night upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shell;eye;sun;bill;pair;world;egg;creature' adjectives='little;free;much;green;white;whole;empty' verbs='be;sit;get;break;encourage;gaze;arise' valence='5.92888888889' arousal='3.85259259259' dominance='5.46592592593'>the nest</entity>, and before the sun arose the five white eggs were empty, and ten pairs of eyes were gazing out upon the green world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='496'>Now the duck had been carefully brought up, and did not like dirt, and, besides, broken shells are not at all comfortable things to sit or walk upon; so she pushed the rest out over the side, and felt delighted to have some company to talk to till the big egg hatched.  But day after day went on, and the big egg showed no signs of cracking, and the duck grew more and more impatient, and began to wish to consult her husband, who never came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='497'>"I can"t think what is the matter with it," the duck grumbled to her neighbour who had called in to pay her a visit.  "Why I could have hatched two broods in the time that this one has taken!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='498'>"Let me look at it," said the old neighbour.  "Ah, I thought so; it is a turkey"s egg.  Once, when I was young, they tricked me to sitting on a brood of turkey"s eggs myself, and when they were hatched the creatures were so stupid that nothing would make them learn to swim.  I have no patience when I think of it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='499'>"Well, I will give it another chance," sighed the duck, "and if it does not come out of its shell in another twenty-four hours, I will just leave it alone and teach the rest of them to swim properly and to find their own food.  I really can"t be expected to do two things at once." And with a fluff of her feathers she pushed the egg into the middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='middle;fluff;egg;feather' adjectives='' verbs='push' valence='5.67' arousal='3.67285714286' dominance='5.35714285714'>the nest</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='500'>All through the next day she sat on, giving up even her morning bath for fear that a blast of cold might strike the big egg.  In the evening, when she ventured to peep, she thought she saw a tiny crack in the upper part of the shell.  Filled with hope, she went back to her duties, though she could hardly sleep all night for excitement.  When she woke with the first steaks of light she felt something stirring under her.  Yes, there it was at last; and as she moved, a big awkward bird tumbled head foremost on the ground.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='501'>There was no denying it was ugly, even the mother was forced to admit that to herself, though she only said it was "large" and "strong." "You won"t need any teaching when you are once in the water," she told him, with a glance of surprise at the dull brown which covered his back, and at his long naked neck.  And indeed he did not, though he was not half so pretty to look at as the little yellow balls that followed her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='502'>When they returned they found the old neighbour on the bank waiting for them to take them into the duckyard.  "No, it is not a young turkey, certainly," whispered she in confidence to the mother, "for though it is lean and skinny, and has no colour to speak of, yet there is something rather distinguished about it, and it holds its head up well."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>"It is very kind of you to say so," answered the mother, who by this time had some secret doubts of its loveliness.  "Of course, when you see it by itself it is all right, though it is different, somehow, from the others.  But one cannot expect all one"s children to be beautiful!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='504'>By this time they had reached the centre of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='duck;respect;fowl;centre;time' adjectives='great;old' verbs='be;reach;treat;have;sit' valence='5.86466666667' arousal='4.01933333333' dominance='5.74933333333'>the yard</entity>, where a very old duck was sitting, who was treated with great respect by all the fowls present.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='505'>"You must go up and bow low before her," whispered the mother to her children, nodding her head in the direction of the old lady, "and keep your legs well apart, as you see me do.  No well-bred duckling turns in its toes.  It is a sign of common parents."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='506'>The little ducks tried hard to make their small fat bodies copy the movements of their mother, and the old lady was quite pleased with them; but the rest of the ducks looked on discontentedly, and said to each other:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='507'>"Oh, dear me, here are ever so many more!  The yard is full already; and did you ever see anything quite as ugly as that great tall creature?  He is a disgrace to any brood.  I shall go and chase him out!"  So saying she put up her feathers, and running to the big duckling bit his neck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='508'>The duckling gave a loud quack; it was the first time he had felt any pain, and at the sound his mother turned quickly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='509'>"Leave him alone," she said fiercely, "or I will send for his father. He was not troubling you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='510'>"No; but he is so ugly and awkward no one can put up with him," answered the stranger.  And though the duckling did not understand the meaning of the words, he felt he was being blamed, and became more uncomfortable still when the old Spanish duck who ruled the fowlyard struck in:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='511'>"It certainly is a great pity he is so different from these beautiful darlings.  If he could only be hatched over again!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='512'>The poor little fellow drooped his head, and did not know where to look, but was comforted when his mother answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='513'>"He may not be quite as handsome as the others, but he swims better, and is very strong; I am sure he will make his way in the world as well as anybody."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='514'>"Well, you must feel quite at home here," said the old duck waddling off.  And so they did, all except the duckling, who was snapped at by everyone when they thought his mother was not looking.  Even the turkey-cock, who was so big, never passed him without mocking words, and his brothers and sisters, who would not have noticed any difference unless it had been put into their heads, soon became as rude and unkind as the rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='515'>At last he could bear it no longer, and one day he fancied he saw signs of his mother turning against him too; so that night, when the ducks and hens were still asleep, he stole away through an open door, and under cover of the burdock leaves scrambled on by the bank of the canal, till he reached a wide grassy moor, full of soft marshy places where the reeds grew.  Here he lay down, but he was too tired and too frightened to fall asleep, and with the earliest peep of the sun the reeds began to rustle, and he saw that he had blundered into a colony of wild ducks.  But as he could not run away again he stood up and bowed politely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='516'>"You are ugly," said the wild ducks, when they had looked him well over; "but, however, it is no business of ours, unless you wish to marry one of our daughters, and that we should not allow."  And the duckling answered that he had no idea of marrying anybody, and wanted nothing but to be left alone after his long journey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='517'>So for two whole days he lay quietly among the reeds, eating such food as he could find, and drinking the water of the moorland pool, till he felt himself quite strong again.  He wished he might stay were he was for ever, he was so comfortable and happy, away from everyone, with nobody to bite him and tell him how ugly he was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='518'>He was thinking these thoughts, when two young ganders caught sight of him as they were having their evening splash among the reeds, looking for their supper.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='519'>"We are getting tired of this moor," they said, "and to-morrow we think of trying another, where the lakes are larger and the feeding better. Will you come with us?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='520'>"Is it nicer than this?" asked the duckling doubtfully.  And the words were hardly out of his mouth, when "Pif! pah!" and the two new- comers were stretched dead beside him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='521'>At the sound of the gun <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sound;firing;air;gun;duck' adjectives='' verbs='fly;rush;continue' valence='5.509' arousal='4.814' dominance='5.436'>the wild</entity> ducks in the rushes flew into the air, and for a few minutes the firing continued.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='522'>Luckily for himself the duckling could not fly, and he floundered along through the water till he could hide himself amidst some tall ferns which grew in a hollow.  But before he got there he met a huge creature on four legs, which he afterwards knew to be a dog, who stood and gazed at him with a long red tongue hanging out of his mouth.  The duckling grew cold with terror, and tried to hide his head beneath his little wings; but the dog snuffed at him and passed on, and he was able to reach his place of shelter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='523'>"I am too ugly even for a dog to eat," said he to himself.  "Well, that is a great mercy."  And he curled himself up in the soft grass till the shots died away in the distance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='524'>When all had been quiet for a long time, and there were only stars to see him, he crept out and looked about him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='525'>He would never go near a pool again, never, thought he; and seeing that the moor stretched far away in the opposite direction from which he had come, he marched bravely on till he got to a small cottage, which seemed too tumbledown for the stones to hold together many hours longer.  Even the door only hung upon one hinge, and as the only light in the room sprang from a tiny fire, the duckling edged himself cautiously in, and lay down under a chair close to the broken door, from which he could get out if necessary.  But no one seemed to see him or smell him; so he spend the rest of the night in peace.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='526'>Now in the cottage dwelt an old woman, her cat, and a hen; and it was really they, and not she, who were masters of the house.  The old woman, who passed all her days in spinning yarn, which she sold at the nearest town, loved both the cat and the hen as her own children, and never contradicted them in any way; so it was their grace, and not hers, that the duckling would have to gain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='527'>It was only next morning, when it grew light, that they noticed their visitor, who stood trembling before them, with his eye on the door ready to escape at any moment.  They did not, however, appear very fierce, and the duckling became less afraid as they approached him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='528'>"Can you lay eggs?" asked the hen.  And the duckling answered meekly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='529'>"No; I don"t know how."  Upon which the hen turned her back, and the cat came forward.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='530'>"Can you ruffle your fur when you are angry, or purr when you are pleased?" said she.  And again the duckling had to admit that he could do nothing but swim, which did not seem of much use to anybody.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='531'>So the cat and the hen went straight off to the old woman, who was still in bed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='532'>"Such a useless creature has taken refuge here," they said.  "It calls itself a duckling; but it can neither lay eggs nor purr!  What had we better do with it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='533'>"Keep it, to be sure!" replied the old woman briskly.  "It is all nonsense about it not laying eggs.  Anyway, we will let it stay here for a bit, and see what happens."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='534'>So the duckling remained for three weeks, and shared the food of the cat and the hen; but nothing in the way of eggs happened at all.  Then the sun came out, and the air grew soft, and the duckling grew tired of being in a hut, and wanted with all his might to have a swim.  And one morning he got so restless that even his friends noticed it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='535'>"What is the matter?" asked the hen; and the duckling told her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='536'>"I am so longing for the water again.  You can"t think how delicious it is to put your head under the water and dive straight to the bottom."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='537'>"I don"t think I should enjoy it," replied the hen doubtfully.  "And I don"t think the cat would like it either."  And the cat, when asked, agreed there was nothing she would hate so much.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='538'>"I can"t stay here any longer, I Must get to the water," repeated the duck.  And the cat and the hen, who felt hurt and offended, answered shortly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='539'>"Very well then, go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='540'>The duckling would have liked to say good- bye, and thank them for their kindness, as he was polite by nature; but they had both turned their backs on him, so he went out of the rickety door feeling rather sad.  But, in spite of himself, he could not help a thrill of joy when he was out in the air and water once more, and cared little for the rude glances of the creatures he met.  For a while he was quite happy and content; but soon the winter came on, and snow began to fall, and everything to grow very wet and uncomfortable.  And the duckling soon found that it is one thing to enjoy being in the water, and quite another to like being damp on land.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='541'>The sun was setting one day, like a great scarlet globe, and the river, to the duckling"s vast bewilderment, was getting hard and slippery, when he heard a sound of whirring wings, and high up in the air a flock of swans were flying.  They were as white as snow which had fallen during the night, and their long necks with yellow bills were stretched southwards, for they were going--they did not quite know whither--but to a land where the sun shone all day.  Oh, if he only could have gone with them!  But that was not possible, of course; and besides, what sort of companion could an ugly thing like him be to those beautiful beings?  So he walked sadly down to a sheltered pool and dived to the very bottom, and tried to think it was the greatest happiness he could dream of.  But, all the same, he knew it wasn"t!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='542'>And every morning it grew colder and colder, and the duckling had hard work to keep himself warm.  Indeed, it would be truer to say that he never was warm at all; and at last, after one bitter night, his legs moved so slowly that the ice crept closer and closer, and when the morning light broke he was caught fast, as in a trap; and soon his senses went from him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='543'>A few hours more and the poor duckling"s life had been ended.  But, by good fortune, a man was crossing the river on his way to his work, and saw in a moment what had happened.  He had on thick wooden shoes, and he went and stamped so hard on the ice that it broke, and then he picked up the duckling and tucked him under his sheepskin coat, where his frozen bones began to thaw a little.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='544'>Instead of going on his work, the man turned back and took the bird to his children, who gave him a warm mess to eat and put him in a box by the fire, and when they came back from school he was much more comfortable than he had been since he had left the old woman"s cottage.  They were kind little children, and wanted to play with him; but, alas! the poor fellow had never played in his life, and thought they wanted to tease him, and flew straight into the milk-pan, and then into the butter-dish, and from that into the meal- barrel, and at last, terrified at the noise and confusion, right out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='back;life;noise;confusion;snow;fellow;bush;right;barrel;meal' adjectives='poor;last;milk-pan;butter-dish' verbs='fly;play;hide;want;tease;have;think;terrify' valence='5.49142857143' arousal='4.30761904762' dominance='5.43857142857'>the door</entity>, and hid himself in the snow amongst the bushes at the back of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='back;life;noise;confusion;snow;fellow;bush;right;barrel;meal' adjectives='poor;last;milk-pan;butter-dish' verbs='fly;play;hide;want;tease;have;think;terrify' valence='5.49142857143' arousal='4.30761904762' dominance='5.43857142857'>the house</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='545'>He never could tell afterwards exactly how he had spent the rest of the winter.  He only knew that he was very miserable and that he never had enough to eat.  But by-and-by things grew better.  The earth became softer, the sun hotter, the birds sang, and the flowers once more appeared in the grass.  When he stood up, he felt different, somehow, from what he had done before he fell asleep among the reeds to which he had wandered after he had escaped from the peasant"s hut.  His body seemed larger, and his wings stronger.  Something pink looked at him from the side of a hill.  He thought he would fly towards it and see what it was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='546'>Oh, how glorious it felt to be rushing through the air, wheeling first one way and then the other!  He had never thought that flying could be like that!  The duckling was almost sorry when he drew near the pink cloud and found it was made up of apple blossoms growing beside a cottage whose garden ran down to the banks of the canal.  He fluttered slowly to the ground and paused for a few minutes under a thicket of syringas, and while he was gazing about him, there walked slowly past a flock of the same beautiful birds he had seen so many months ago. Fascinated, he watched them one by one step into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;step;float;part' adjectives='' verbs='be;watch;fascinate' valence='6.039' arousal='3.594' dominance='5.854'>the canal</entity>, and float quietly upon the waters as if they were part of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='547'>"I will follow them," said the duckling to himself; "ugly though I am, I would rather be killed by them than suffer all I have suffered from cold and hunger, and from the ducks and fowls who should have treated me kindly."  And flying quickly down to the water, he swam after them as fast as he could.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='548'>It did not take him long to reach them, for they had stopped to rest in a green pool shaded by a tree whose branches swept the water.  And directly they saw him coming some of the younger ones swam out to meet him with cries of welcome, which again the duckling hardly understood. He approached them glad, yet trembling, and turning to one of the older birds, who by this time had left the shade of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bird;shade;time' adjectives='glad;older' verbs='approach;leave;turn;say;have;tremble' valence='5.835' arousal='3.7425' dominance='5.70333333333'>the tree</entity>, he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='549'>"If I am to die, I would rather you should kill me.  I don"t know why I was ever hatched, for I am too ugly to live."  And as he spoke, he bowed his head and looked down into the water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='550'>Reflected in the still pool he saw many white shapes, with long necks and golden bills, and, without thinking, he looked for the dull grey body and the awkward skinny neck.  But no such thing was there. Instead, he beheld beneath him a beautiful white swan!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='551'>"The new one is the best of all," said the children when they came down to feed the swans with biscuit and cake before going to bed.  "His feathers are whiter and his beak more golden than the rest."  And when he heard that, the duckling thought that it was worth while having undergone all the persecution and loneliness that he had passed through, as otherwise he would never have known what it was to be really happy.</paragraph>

Her stepsister, on the other hand, had spent her childhood in working hard to keep house for her father, who died soon after his second marriage; and she was as much beloved by the neighbours for her goodness and industry as she was for her beauty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='558'>As the years went on, the difference between the two girls grew more marked, and the old woman treated her stepdaughter worse than ever, and was always on the watch for some pretext for beating her, or depriving her of her food.

And though she was quite alone, the girl"s heart danced too, for she felt happier than she had since her father died.

The cows were so pleased with the care she took of them that they stood quite still while she milked them, and did not play any of the tricks on her that they had played on other dairymaids who were rough and rude.  And when she had done, and was going to get up from her stool, she found sitting round her a whole circle of cats, black and white, tabby and tortoise- shell, who all cried with one voice:</paragraph>

This at last so annoyed him that he tried to think how he could pick a quarrel with the goldsmith, so that he should not beg him to walk with him any more.  He asked another cowherd for advice, and he said the best thing he could do was to go across and kill the goldsmith"s wife, for then the goldsmith would be sure to regard him as an enemy; so, being a foolish person, and there being no laws in that country by which a man would be certainly punished for such a crime, the cowherd one evening took a big stick and went across to the goldsmith"s house when only Mrs. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='enemy;head;cowherd;wife;country;advice;mrs.;crime;thing;s;person;stick;house;home;goldsmith;law;man' adjectives='such;sure;foolish;best;big' verbs='do;be;punish;regard;bang;go;say;kill;take;die;ask' valence='5.30644444444' arousal='4.30444444444' dominance='5.30355555556'>Goldsmith</entity> was at home, and banged her on the head so hard that she died then and there.</paragraph>

Now it very soon appeared that the goldsmith had a lot of extra money, so that people began to ask questions, and finally demanded of him the reason for his sudden wealth.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='667'>Instantly the villagers went away and each caught hold of his own wife and throttled her, and the next day they all went off to sell their dead wives.  Many a weary mile did they tramp, but got nothing but hard words or laughter, or directions to the nearest cemetery, from people to whom they offered dead wives for sale.  At last they perceived that they had been cheated somehow by that goldsmith.  So off they rushed home, seized the unhappy man, and, without listening to his cries and entreaties, hurried him down to the river bank and flung him--plop!--into the deepest, weediest, and nastiest place they could find.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='668'>"That will teach him to play tricks on us," said they.  "For as he can"t swim he"ll drown, and we sha"n"t have any more trouble with him!"</paragraph>

But, in reality, he was carried down, half drowned, below the next bend in the river, where he fortunately came across a "snag" floating in the water (a snag is, you know, a part of a tree or bush which floats very nearly under the surface of the water); and he held on to this snag, and by great good luck eventually came ashore some two or three miles down the river.  At the place where he landed he came across a fine fat cow buffalo, and immediately he jumped on her back and rode home.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='671'>"Ah!" said the goldsmith, "you little know what delightful adventures I have had!  Why, down in that place in the river where you threw me in I found meadows, and trees, and fine pastures, and buffaloes, and all kinds of cattle.  In fact, I could hardly tear myself away; but I thought that I must really let you all know about it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='672'>"Oh, oh!" thought the greedy village people; "if there are buffaloes to be had for the taking we"ll go after some too."  Encouraged by the goldsmith they nearly all ran off the very next morning to the river; and, in order that they might get down quickly to the beautiful place the goldsmith told them of, they tied great stones on to their feet and their necks, and one after another they jumped into the water as fast as the could, and were drowned.  And whenever any one of them waved his hands about and struggled the goldsmith would cry out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='673'>"Look! he"s beckoning the rest of you to come; he"s got a fine buffalo!" And others who were doubtful would jump in, until not one was left.  Then the cunning goldsmith went back and took all the village for himself, and became very rich indeed.  But do you think he was happy?  Not a bit.  Lies never made a man happy yet.  Truly, he got the better of a set of wicked and greedy people, but only by being wicked and greedy himself; and, as it turned out, when he got so rich he got very fat; and at last was so fat that he couldn"t move, and one day he got the apoplexy and died, and no one in the world cared the least bit.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='720'>The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her.  As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen.  At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='length;plan;harm;mother' adjectives='' verbs='be;begin;do;feel;revenge;invent;have' valence='5.57615384615' arousal='4.45769230769' dominance='5.66846153846'>the girl</entity> who had never done her any harm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='721'>Her plan was this.  In the town where she had lived before she was married there was an old witch, who had more skill in magic that any other witch she knew.

She told her daughter what she meant to do, and although the daughter could only say "dirty creatures," in answer, she nodded and smiled and looked well pleased.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='722'>Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped.  By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference.

This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before.  The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them.  At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom.  Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shoulder;head;daughter;lace;mask;cloak;velvet;veil' adjectives='' verbs='fasten;arrange;let;have;fling' valence='5.67941176471' arousal='4.13470588235' dominance='5.56470588235'>the princess</entity> had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='735'>The next morning he went to the false bride"s room, but her ladies told him she would neither speak nor get up, though she ate everything they set before her.  The prince was sorely perplexed as to what could be the matter with her, for naturally he could not guess that she was expecting her mother to return every moment, and to remove the spell the doves had laid upon her, and meanwhile was afraid to speak lest she should betray herself.  At length he made up his mind to summon all the court physicians; he did not tell her what he was going to do, lest it should make her worse, but he went himself and begged the four learned leeches attached to the king"s person to follow him to the princess"s apartments.  Unfortunately, as they entered, the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves, and shrieked out: "Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!" which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once, and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain.  He then tried to persuade his wife to send them a message that she was sorry for her rudeness, but not a word would she say.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='736'>Late that evening, when he had performed all the tiresome duties which fall to the lot of every prince, the young man was leaning out of his window, refreshing himself with the cool breezes that blew off the sea.  His thoughts went back to the scene of the morning, and he wondered if, after all, he had not made a great mistake in marrying a low-born wife, however beautiful she might be.  How could he have imagined that the quiet, gentle girl who had been so charming a companion to him during the first days of their marriage, could have become in a day the rude, sulky woman, who could not control her temper even to benefit herself.  One thing was clear, if she did not change her conduct very shortly he would have to send her away from court.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='757'>By chance in the afternoon a leopard appeared, and the weaver instantly ran home as fast as he could to get the stones which the farmer had shown him, to throw at the creature.

"Were there no stones on the hillside that you should run back to get them, you senseless one?" he cried; "you are not fit to herd sheep.  To-day you shall stay at home and mind my old mother who is sick, perhaps you will be able to drive flies off her face, if you can"t drive beasts away from sheep!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='758'>So, the next day, the weaver was left at home to take care of the farmer"s old sick mother.  Now as she lay outside on a bed, it turned out that the flies became very troublesome, and the weaver looked round for something to drive them away with; and as he had been told to pick up the nearest stone to drive the beasts away from the flock, he thought he would this time show how cleverly he could obey orders. Accordingly he seized the nearest stone, which was a big, heavy one, and dashed it at the flies; but, unhappily, he slew the poor old woman also; and then, being afraid of the wrath of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fly;stone;woman;wrath;slew;neighbourhood' adjectives='heavy;nearest;afraid;old;big;poor' verbs='dash;be;see;flee;seize' valence='5.02105263158' arousal='4.15684210526' dominance='5.16736842105'>the farmer</entity>, he fled and was not seen again in that neighbourhood.</paragraph>

On the way they had to cross a ravine which lately had been full of water, but now was quite dry.  The weavers, however, were accustomed to swim over this ravine; therefore, regardless of the fact that this time it was dry, they stripped, and, tying their clothes on their heads, they proceeded to swim across the dry sand and rocks that formed the bed of the ravine.  Thus they got to the other side without further damage than bruised knees and elbows, and as soon as they were over, one of them began to count the party to make sure that all were safe there.  He counted all except himself, and then cried out that somebody was missing!  This set each of them counting; but each made the same mistake of counting all except himself, so that they became certain that one of their party was missing!  They ran up and down the bank of the ravine wringing their hands in great distress and looking for signs of their lost comrade.  There a farmer found them and asked what was the matter.  "Alas!" said one, "seven of us started from the other bank and one must have been drowned on the crossing, as we can only find six remaining!" The farmer eyed them a minute, and then, picking up his stick, he dealt each a sounding blow, counting, as he did so, "One! two! three!" and so on up to the seven.  When the weavers found that there were seven of them they were overcome with gratitude to one whom they took for a magician as he could thus make seven out of an obvious six.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='768'>Once upon a time there lived an old man who dwelt with his son in a small hut on the edge of the plain.  He was very old, and had worked very hard, and when at last he was struck down by illness he felt that he should never rise from his bed again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='769'>So, one day, he bade his wife summon their son, when he came back from his journey to the nearest town, where he had been to buy bread.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='770'>"Come hither, my son," said he; "I know myself well to be dying, and I have nothing to leave you but my falcon, my cat and my greyhound; but if you make good use of them you will never lack food.  Be good to your mother, as you have been to me.  And now farewell!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='771'>Then he turned his face to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='face' adjectives='' verbs='turn;die' valence='4.635' arousal='4.4675' dominance='4.835'>the wall</entity> and died.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='772'>There was great mourning in the hut for many days, but at length the son rose up, and calling to his greyhound, his cat and his falcon, he left the house saying that he would bring back something for dinner. Wandering over the plain, he noticed a troop of gazelles, and pointed to his greyhound to give chase.  The dog soon brought down a fine fat beast, and slinging it over his shoulders, the young man turned homewards.  On the way, however, he passed a pond, and as he approached a cloud of birds flew into the air.  Shaking his wrist, the falcon seated on it darted into the air, and swooped down upon the quarry he had marked, which fell dead to the ground.  The young man picked it up, and put it in his pouch and then went towards home again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='773'>Near the hut was a small barn in which he kept the produce of the little patch of corn, which grew close to the garden.  Here a rat ran out almost under his feet, followed by another and another; but quick as thought the cat was upon them and not one escaped her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='774'>When all the rats were killed, the young man left the barn.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='775'>"Young man," said the ogre (for such was the stranger), "you have been a good son, and you deserve the piece of luck which has befallen you this day.  Come with me to that shining lake yonder, and fear nothing."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='778'>So the young man stepped bravely into the lake, and felt himself sinking, sinking, till he reached firm ground at last.  In front of him lay four heaps of silver, and in the midst of them a curious white shining stone, marked over with strange characters, such as he had never seen before.  He picked it up in order to examine it more closely, and as he held it the stone spoke.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='784'>When he was out of sight the young man took the stone from his turban and looked at it.  "I want the finest camel that can be found, and the most splendid garments," said he.</paragraph>

And he shut them; and when he opened them again the camel that he had wished for was standing before him, while the festal robes of a desert prince hung from his shoulders.

But at length the young man grew tired of always staying inside walls, and he told his wife that the next day he must leave her for a few hours, and go out hunting.  "You will not mind?" he asked.  And she answered as became a good wife:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='816'>"I have no particular wish to sell them myself," answered the ogre, with equal indifference.

But you will have to pretend that you want it for yourself; and, above all, do not mention me, for he sets great store by it, and would never part with it to a stranger! To-morrow I will return with some jewels yet finer than those I have with me to-day.  So, madam, farewell!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='817'>Left alone, the princess began to think of many things, but chiefly as to whether she would persuade her husband to give her the stone or not.  At one moment she felt he had already bestowed so much upon her that it was a shame to ask for the only object he had kept back.  No, it would be mean; she could not do it!  But then, those diamonds, and those string of pearls!  After all, they had only been married a week, and the pleasure of giving it to her ought to be far greater than the pleasure of keeping it for himself.  And she was sure it would be!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='818'>Well, that evening, when the young man had supped off his favourite dishes which the princess took care to have specially prepared for him, she sat down close beside him, and began stroking his head.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='821'>"And what is that?  Of course you shall have it directly!" he asked eagerly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='822'>"It is that bright stone which fell out of the folds of your turban a few days ago," she answered, playing with his finger; "the little stone with all those funny marks upon it.  I never saw any stone like it before."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='823'>The young man did not answer at first; then he said, slowly:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='830'>"Yes, here," she answered, slipping the stone from her sash and placing it among the rest.  Then she raised her voice, and began to talk quickly of the prices of the chains and necklaces, and after some bargaining, to deceive the attendants, she declared that she liked one string of pearls better than all the rest, and that the ogre might take away the other things, which were not half as valuable as he supposed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='831'>"As you please, madam," said he, bowing himself out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='madam' adjectives='' verbs='say;please;bow' valence='5.66' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.725'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='832'>Soon after he had gone a curious thing happened.  The princess carelessly touched the wall of her room, which was wont to reflect the warm red light of the fire on the hearth, and found her hand quite wet.  She turned round, and--was it her fancy? or did the fire burn more dimly than before?  Hurriedly she passed into the picture gallery, where pools of water showed here and there on the floor, and a cold chill ran through her whole body.  At that instant her frightened ladies came running down the stairs, crying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='833'>"Madam! madam! what has happened?  <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='eye' adjectives='' verbs='be;disappear' valence='5.7375' arousal='3.9075' dominance='5.565'>The palace</entity> is disappearing under our eyes!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='834'>"My husband will be home very soon," answered the princess--who, though nearly as much frightened as her ladies, felt that she must set them a good example.  "Wait till then, and he will tell us what to do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='835'>So they waited, seated on the highest chairs they could find, wrapped in their warmest garments, and with piles of cushions under their feet, while the poor birds flew with numbed wings hither and thither, till they were so lucky as to discover an open window in some forgotten corner.  Through this they vanished, and were seen no more.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='836'>At last, when the princess and her ladies had been forced to leave the upper rooms, where the walls and floors had melted away, and to take refuge in the hall, the young man came home.  He had ridden back along a winding road from which he did not see the palace till he was close upon it, and stood horrified at the spectacle before him.  He knew in an instant that his wife must have betrayed his trust, but he would not reproach her, as she must be suffering enough already.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='840'>With his falcon on his wrist, and his greyhound and cat behind him, the young man walked a long way, inquiring of everyone he met whether they had seen his enemy the ogre.  But nobody had.  Then he bade his falcon fly up into the sky--up, up, and up--and try if his sharp eyes could discover the old thief.  The bird had to go so high that he did not return for some hours; but he told his master that the ogre was lying asleep in a splendid palace in a far country on the shores of the sea. This was delightful news to the young man, who instantly bought some meat for the falcon, bidding him make a good meal.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='928'>But a very few days of wandering opened their eyes.  Nobody seemed to want them, or, if they did, the young men declared that they were not able to undertake all that the farmers or millers or woodcutters required of them.  The youngest brother, who was wiser, would gladly have done some of the work that the others refused, but he was small and slight, and no one thought of offering him any.

The young men"s hearts rejoiced as they thought that at last they would be able to rest their weary limbs, and they entered the hut, but were amazed to see an ugly old woman inside, wrapped in a cloak of gold which lighted up the whole house. They looked at each other uneasily as she came forward with her daughter, as they knew by the cloak that this was a famous witch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='931'>"What do you want?" asked she, at the same time signing to her daughter to stir the large pot on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pot;daughter;time' adjectives='large;same' verbs='ask;stir;sign' valence='5.6' arousal='4.19125' dominance='5.4275'>the fire</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='936'>Now, at last, their luck seemed to have turned, for while the two eldest were given places in the king"s stables, Pinkel was taken as page to the little prince.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='938'>Their opportunity soon came.  It happened to be the king"s custom to visit his stables once a week, so that he might see that his horses were being properly cared for.  The next time he entered the stables the two brothers managed to be in the way, and when the king praised the beautiful satin skins of the horses under their charge, and remarked how different was their condition when his grooms had first come across the lake, the young men at once began to speak of the wonderful light which sprang from the lantern over the hut.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;passion;trap;collection;lantern' adjectives='marvellous;rarest' verbs='inquire;get;find;have;fall' valence='5.51666666667' arousal='4.1375' dominance='5.48166666667'>The king</entity>, who had a passion for collection all the rarest things he could find, fell into the trap directly, and inquired where he could get this marvellous lantern.</paragraph>

So he climbed softly on to the roof, and, peering, watched till the old woman"s back was turned, when he quickly drew a handful of salt from his pocket and threw it into the pot.  Scarcely had he done this when the witch called her daughter and bade her lift the pot off the fire and put the stew into a dish, as it had been cooking quite long enough and she was hungry.  But no sooner had she tasted it than she put her spoon down, and declared that her daughter must have been meddling with it, for it was impossible to eat anything that was all made of salt.</paragraph>

Then, while the animal was eating it, he stuffed each golden bell with wool which he had also brought with him, stopping every minute to listen, lest the witch should awaken, and he should find himself changed into some dreadful bird or beast.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='992'>"It is no night for my cloak," she muttered; "it would be covered with mud by the time I got back."

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='993'>He had not gone far when a puff of wind unfolded the cloak, and its brightness shed gleams across the water.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1006'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1007'>In a country which is full of wild beasts of all sorts there once lived a jackal and a hedgehog, and, unlike though they were, the two animals made great friends, and were often seen in each other"s company.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1008'>One afternoon they were walking along a road together, when the jackal, who was the taller of the two, exclaimed:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1009'>"Oh! there is a barn full of corn; let us go and eat some."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1010'>"Yes, do let us!" answered the hedgehog.  So they went to the barn, and ate till they could eat no more.  Then the jackal put on his shoes, which he had taken off so as to make no noise, and they returned to the high road.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1011'>After they had gone some way they met a panther, who stopped, and bowing politely, said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1012'>"Excuse my speaking to you, but I cannot help admiring those shoes of yours.  Do you mind telling me who made them?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1013'>"Yes, I think they are rather nice," answered the jackal; "I made them myself, though."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1014'>"Could you make me a pair like them?" asked the panther eagerly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1015'>"I would do my best, of course," replied the jackal; "but you must kill me a cow, and when we have eaten the flesh I will take the skin and make your shoes out of it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1016'>So the panther prowled about until he saw a fine cow grazing apart from the rest of the herd.  He killed it instantly, and then gave a cry to the jackal and hedgehog to come to the place where he was.  They soon skinned the dead beasts, and spread its skin out to dry, after which they had a grand feast before they curled themselves up for the night, and slept soundly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1017'>Next morning the jackal got up early and set to work upon the shoes, while the panther sat by and looked on with delight.  At last they were finished, and the jackal arose and stretched himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1018'>"Now go and lay them in the sun out there," said he; "in a couple of hours they will be ready to put on; but do not attempt to wear them before, or you will feel them most uncomfortable.  But I see the sun is high in the heavens, and we must be continuing our journey."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1019'>The panther, who always believed what everybody told him, did exactly as he was bid, and in two hours" time began to fasten on the shoes. They certainly set off his paws wonderfully, and he stretched out his forepaws and looked at them with pride.  But when he tried to walk--ah! that was another story!  They were so stiff and hard that he nearly shrieked every step he took, and at last he sank down where he was, and actually began to cry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1020'>After some time some little partridges who were hopping about heard the poor panther"s groans, and went up to see what was the matter.  He had never tried to make his dinner off them, and they had always been quite friendly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1021'>"You seem in pain," said one of them, fluttering close to him, "can we help you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1022'>"Oh, it is the jackal!  He made me these shoes; they are so hard and tight that they hurt my feet, and I cannot manage to kick them off."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1023'>"Lie still, and we will soften them," answered the kind little partridge.  And calling to his brothers, they all flew to the nearest spring, and carried water in their beaks, which they poured over the shoes.  This they did till the hard leather grew soft, and the panther was able to slip his feet out of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1024'>"Oh, thank you, thank you," he cried, skipping round with joy.  "I feel a different creature.  Now I will go after the jackal and pay him my debts."  And he bounded away into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='bound' valence='5.365' arousal='4.995' dominance='5.28'>the forest</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1025'>But the jackal had been very cunning, and had trotted backwards and forwards and in and out, so that it was very difficult to know which track he had really followed.  At length, however, the panther caught sight of his enemy, at the same moment that the jackal had caught sight of him.  The panther gave a loud roar, and sprang forward, but the jackal was too quick for him and plunged into a dense thicket, where the panther could not follow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1026'>Disgusted with his failure, but more angry than ever, the panther lay down for a while to consider what he should do next, and as he was thinking, an old man came by.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1027'>"Oh! father, tell me how I can repay the jackal for the way he has served me!" And without more ado he told his story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1028'>"If you take my advice," answered the old man, "you will kill a cow, and invite all the jackals in the forest to the feast.  Watch them carefully while they are eating, and you will see that most of them keep their eyes on their food.  But if one of them glances at you, you will know that is the traitor."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1029'>The panther, whose manners were always good, thanked the old man, and followed his counsel.  The cow was killed, and the partridges flew about with invitations to the jackals, who gathered in large numbers to the feast.  The wicked jackal came amongst them; but as the panther had only seen him once he could not distinguish him from the rest. However, they all took their places on wooden seats placed round the dead cow, which was laid across the boughs of a fallen tree, and began their dinner, each jackal fixing his eyes greedily on the piece of meat before him.  Only one of them seemed uneasy, and every now and then glanced in the direction of his host.  This the panther noticed, and suddenly made a bound at the culprit and seized his tail; but again the jackal was too quick for him, and catching up a knife he cut off his tail and darted into the forest, followed by all the rest of the party.  And before the panther had recovered from his surprise he found himself alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1030'>"What am I to do now?" he asked the old man, who soon came back to see how things had turned out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1031'>"It is very unfortunate, certainly," answered he; "but I think I know where you can find him.  There is a melon garden about two miles from here, and as jackals are very fond of melons they are nearly sure to have gone there to feed.  If you see a tailless jackal you will know that he is the one you want."  So the panther thanked him and went his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1032'>Now the jackal had guessed what advice the old man would give his enemy, and so, while his friends were greedily eating the ripest melons in the sunniest corner of the garden, he stole behind them and tied their tails together.  He had only just finished when his ears caught the sound of breaking branches; and he cried: "Quick! quick! here comes the master of the garden!" And the jackals sprang up and ran away in all directions, leaving their tails behind them.  And how was the panther to know which was his enemy?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1033'>"They none of them had any tails," he said sadly to the old man, "and I am tired of hunting them.  I shall leave them alone and go and catch something for supper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1034'>Of course the hedgehog had not been able to take part in any of these adventures; but as soon as all danger was over, the jackal went to look for his friend, whom he was lucky enough to find at home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1035'>"Ah, there you are," he said gaily.  "I have lost my tail since I saw you last.  And other people have lost theirs too; but that is no matter!  I am hungry, so come with me to the shepherd who is sitting over there, and we will ask him to sell us one of his sheep."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1036'>"Yes, that is a good plan," answered the hedgehog.  And he walked as fast as his little legs would go to keep up with the jackal.  When they reached the shepherd the jackal pulled out his purse from under his foreleg, and made his bargain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1037'>"Only wait till to-morrow," said the shepherd, "and I will give you the biggest sheep you ever saw.  But he always feeds at some distance from the rest of the flock, and it would take me a long time to catch him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1038'>"Well, it is very tiresome, but I suppose I must wait," replied the jackal.  And he and the hedgehog looked about for a nice dry cave in which to make themselves comfortable for the night.  But, after they had gone, the shepherd killed one of his sheep, and stripped off his skin, which he sewed tightly round a greyhound he had with him, and put a cord round its neck.  Then he lay down and went to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1039'>Very, very early, before the sun was properly up, the jackal and the hedgehog were pulling at the shepherd"s cloak.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1040'>"Wake up," they said, "and give us that sheep.  We have had nothing to eat all night, and are very hungry."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1041'>The shepherd yawned and rubbed his eyes.  "He is tied up to that tree; go and take him."  So they went to the tree and unfastened the cord, and turned to go back to the cave where they had slept, dragging the greyhound after them.  When they reached <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='jackal;hedgehog' adjectives='' verbs='say;reach' valence='5.3725' arousal='4.1875' dominance='5.405'>the cave</entity> the jackal said to the hedgehog.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1042'>"Before I kill him let me see whether he is fat or thin."  And he stood a little way back, so that he might the better examine the animal. After looking at him, with his head on one side, for a minute or two, he nodded gravely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1043'>"He is quite fat enough; he is a good sheep."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1044'>But the hedgehog, who sometimes showed more cunning than anyone would have guessed, answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1045'>"My friend, you are talking nonsense.  The wool is indeed a sheep"s wool, but the paws of my uncle the greyhound peep out from underneath."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1046'>"He is a sheep," repeated the jackal, who did not like to think anyone cleverer than himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1047'>"Hold the cord while I look at him," answered the hedgehog.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1048'>Very unwillingly the jackal held the rope, while the hedgehog walked slowly round the greyhound till he reached the jackal again.  He knew quite well by the paws and tail that it was a greyhound and not a sheep, that the shepherd had sold them; and as he could not tell what turn affairs might take, he resolved to get out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sheep;shepherd;affair;paw;greyhound;tail' adjectives='' verbs='sell;be;resolve;get;turn;know;have;tell;take' valence='5.46833333333' arousal='3.78444444444' dominance='5.45'>the way</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1049'>"Oh! yes, you are right," he said to the jackal; "but I never can eat till I have first drunk.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1050'>"Don"t be long, then," called the jackal, as the hedgehog hurried off at his best pace.  And he lay down under a rock to wait for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1051'>More than an hour passed by and the hedgehog had had plenty of time to go to the spring and back, and still there was no sign of him.  And this was very natural, as he had hidden himself in some long grass under a tree!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1052'>At length the jackal guessed that for some reason his friend had run away, and determined to wait for his breakfast no longer.  So he went up to the place where the greyhound had been tethered and untied the rope.  But just as he was about to spring on his back and give him a deadly bite, the jackal heard a low growl, which never proceeded from the throat of any sheep.  Like a flash of lightning the jackal threw down the cord and was flying across the plain; but though his legs were long, the greyhound"s legs were longer still, and he soon came up with his prey.  The jackal turned to fight, but he was no match for the greyhound, and in a few minutes he was lying dead on the ground, while the greyhound was trotting peacefully back to the shepherd.</paragraph>

The animal he saw most of was a hyena; and one day, when they were taking a walk together, they picked up a beautiful green cloak, which had evidently been dropped by some one riding across the plain on a camel.  Of course each wanted to have it, and they almost quarrelled over the matter; but at length it was settled that the hyena should wear the cloak by day and the jackal by night.  After a little while, however, the jackal became discontented with this arrangement, declaring that none of his friends, who were quite different from those of the hyena, could see the splendour of the mantle, and that it was only fair that he should sometimes be allowed to wear it by day.  To this the hyena would by no means consent, and they were on the eve of a quarrel when the hyena proposed that they should ask the lion to judge between them.  The jackal agreed to this, and the hyena wrapped the cloak about him, and they both trotted off to the lion"s den.</paragraph>

In an instant his brothers had turned their bags upside down, so that the copper money tumbled out on to the floor, and were shovelling in handfuls of the silver instead.  They had hardly finished, when Jack opened yet a third door, and all three fell back in amazement, for this room as a mass of gold, so bright that their eyes grew sore as they looked at it.  However, they soon recovered from their surprise, and quickly emptied their bags of silver, and filled them with gold instead.

Then he went after them, and found them lying down to rest in the midst of a forest.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1178'>The next morning his brothers went home, and bought a beautiful house, where they lived with their mother like great lords.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1179'>Jack remained for some hours in hiding, thankful to be safe from his tormentors; but when no one came to trouble him, and his back did not ache so much, he began to think what he had better do.  At length he made up his mind to go to the caste and take away as much money with him as would enable him to live in comfort for the rest of his life. This being decided, he sprang up, and set out along the path which led to the castle.  As before, the door stood open, and he went on till he had reached the hall of gold, and there he took off his jacket and tied the sleeves together so that it might make a kind of bag.  He then began to pour in the gold by handfuls, when, all at once, a noise like thunder shook the castle.  This was followed by a voice, hoarse as that of a bull, which cried:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1180'>"I smell the smell of a man."  And two giants entered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1181'>"So, little worm! it is you who steal our treasures!" exclaimed the biggest.  "Well, we have got you now, and we will cook you for supper!"  But here the other giant drew him aside, and for a moment or two they whispered together.  At length the first giant spoke:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1182'>"To please my friend I will spare your life on condition that, for the future, you shall guard our treasures.  If you are hungry take this little table and rap on it, saying, as you do so: "The dinner of an emperor!" and you will get as much food as you want."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1183'>With a light heart Jack promised all that was asked of him, and for some days enjoyed himself mightily.  He had everything he could wish for, and did nothing from morning till night; but by-and-by he began to get very tired of it all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1184'>"Let the giants guard their treasures themselves," he said to himself at last; "I am going away.  But I will leave all the gold and silver behind me, and will take nought but you, my good little table."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1185'>So, tucking the table under his arm, he started off for the forest, but he did not linger there long, and soon found himself in the fields on the other side.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1186'>"You could not have asked a better person," answered Jack cheerfully. And signing to him to sit down with him under a tree, he set <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='front;tree;time' adjectives='' verbs='strike;sit;set;cry;sign' valence='5.202' arousal='3.769' dominance='5.112'>the table</entity> in front of them, and struck it three times, crying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1187'>"The dinner of an emperor!" He had hardly uttered the words when fish and meat of all kinds appeared on it!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1188'>"That is a clever trick of yours," said the old man, when he had eaten as much as he wanted.  "Give it to me in exchange for a treasure I have which is still better.  Do you see this cornet?  Well, you have only to tell it that you wish for an army, and you will have as many soldiers as you require."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1189'>Now, since he had been left to himself, Jack had grown ambitious, so, after a moment"s hesitation, he took the cornet and gave the table in exchange.  The old man bade him farewell, and set off down one path, while Jack chose another, and for a long time he was quite pleased with his new possession.  Then, as he felt hungry, he wished for his table back again, as no house was in sight, and he wanted some supper badly. All at once he remembered his cornet, and a wicked thought entered his mind.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1190'>"Two hundred hussars, forward!" cried he.  And the neighing of horses and the clanking of swords were heard close at hand.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1195'>Oh, what a good supper Jack had that night, quite forgetting that he owed it to a mean trick.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1203'>Now that by his cunning he had obtained possession of the three magic objects, he resolved to return to his native place.  Smearing his face with dirt, and tearing his clothes so as to look like a beggar, he stopped the passers by and, on pretence of seeking money or food, he questioned them about the village gossip.  In this manner he learned that his brothers had become great men, much respected in all the country round.  When he heard that, he lost no time in going to the door of their fine house and imploring them to give him food and shelter; but the only thing he got was hard words, and a command to beg elsewhere.  At length, however, at their mother"s entreaty, he was told that he might pass the night in the stable.  Here he waited until everybody in the house was sound asleep, when he drew his bag from under his cloak, and desired that a castle might appear in that place; and the cornet gave him soldiers to guard the castle, while the table furnished him with a good supper.  In the morning, he caused it all to vanish, and when his brothers entered <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='straw;brother' adjectives='' verbs='lie;vanish;cause;find;enter' valence='5.29' arousal='3.89444444444' dominance='5.62555555556'>the stable</entity> they found him lying on the straw.</paragraph>

But though they had solemnly promised to reveal nothing, somehow or other the tale leaked out, and before long reached the ears of the king himself.

He could not hope to be more than king, and as long as he had his cornet to provide him with soldiers he was secure against his enemies.  He never forgave his brothers for the way they had treated him, though he presented his mother with a beautiful castle, and everything she could possibly wish for.  In the centre of his own palace was a treasure chamber, and in this chamber the table, the cornet, and the bag were kept as the most prized of all his possessions, and not a week passed without a visit from king John to make sure they were safe.  He reigned long and well, and died a very old man, beloved by his people.  But his good example was not followed by his sons and his grandsons.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1224'>A long way off, near the sea coast of the east of Africa, there dwelt, once upon a time, a man and his wife.  They had two children, a son and a daughter, whom they loved very much, and, like parents in other countries, they often talked of the fine marriages the young people would make some day.  Out there both boys and girls marry early, and very soon, it seemed to the mother, a message was sent by a rich man on the other side of the great hills offering a fat herd of oxen in exchange for the girl.  Everyone in the house and in the village rejoiced, and the maiden was despatched to her new home.  When all was quiet again the father said to his son:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1225'>"Now that we own such a splendid troop of oxen you had better hasten and get yourself a wife, lest some illness should overtake them. Already we have seen in the villages round about one or two damsels whose parents would gladly part with them for less than half the herd. Therefore tell us which you like best, and we will buy her for you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1226'>But the son answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1227'>"Not so; the maidens I have seen do not please me.  If, indeed, I must marry, let me travel and find a wife for myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1228'>"It shall be as you wish," said the parents; "but if by-and-by trouble should come of it, it will be your fault and not ours."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1229'>The youth, however, would not listen; and bidding his father and mother farewell, set out on his search.  Far, far away he wandered, over mountains and across rivers, till he reached a village where the people were quite different from those of his own race.  He glanced about him and noticed that the girls were fair to look upon, as they pounded maize or stewed something that smelt very nice in earthen pots--especially if you were hot and tired; and when one of the maidens turned round and offered the stranger some dinner, he made up his mind that he would wed her and nobody else.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1230'>So he sent a message to her parents asking their leave to take her for his wife, and they came next day to bring their answer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1231'>"We will give you our daughter," said they, "if you can pay a good price for her.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1232'>"No; I have the price with me," replied the young man; laying down a handful of gold pieces.  "Here it is--take it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1235'>"No; they are not used to travelling," answered the bridegroom.  "Let the ceremony be performed without delay, and we will set forth at once.  It is a long journey."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1236'>Then the parents called in the girl, who was lying in the sun outside the hut, and, in the presence of all the village, a goat was killed, the sacred dance took place, and a blessing was said over the heads of the young people.  After that the bride was led aside by her father, whose duty it was to bestow on her some parting advice as to her conduct in her married life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1237'>"Be good to your husband"s parents," added he, "and always do the will of your husband."  And the girl nodded her head obediently.  Next it was the mother"s turn; and, as was the custom of the tribe, she spoke to her daughter:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1238'>"Will you choose which of your sisters shall go with you to cut your wood and carry your water?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1239'>"I do not want any of them," answered she; "they are no use.  They will drop <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water' adjectives='' verbs='drop;spill' valence='5.2' arousal='3.704' dominance='5.684'>the wood</entity> and spill the water."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1240'>"Then will you have any of the other children?  There are enough to spare," asked the mother again.  But the bride said quickly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1241'>"I will have none of them!  You must give me our buffalo, the Rover of the Plain; he alone shall serve me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1242'>"What folly you talk!" cried the parents.  "Give you our buffalo, the Rover of the Plain?  Why, you know that our life depends on him.  Here he is well fed and lies on soft grass; but how can you tell what will befall him in another country?  The food may be bad, he will die of hunger; and, if he dies we die also."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1243'>"No, no," said the bride; "I can look after him as well as you.  Get him ready, for the sun is sinking and it is time we set forth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1244'>So she went away and put together a small pot filled with healing herms, a horn that she used in tending sick people, a little knife, and a calabash containing deer fat; and, hiding these about her, she took leave of her father and mother and started across the mountains by the side of her husband.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1249'>"I have dropped my necklace of beads in the field, and I must go and look for it."  But in truth she had done nothing of the sort, and it was only an excuse to go and seek the buffalo.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1253'>Oh, how much better a servant he was than any of the little girls the bride had refused to bring with her!  If she wanted water, she had only to cross the patch of maize behind the hut and seek out the place where the buffalo lay hidden, and put down her pail beside him.  Then she would sit at her ease while he went to the lake and brought the bucket back brimming over.  If she wanted wood, he would break the branches off the trees and lay them at her feet.  And the villagers watched her return laden, and said to each other:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1254'>"Surely the girls of her country are stronger than our girls, for none of them could cut so quickly or carry so much!"  But then, nobody knew that she had a buffalo for a servant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1255'>Only, all this time she never gave the poor buffalo anything to eat, because she had just one dish, out of which she and her husband ate; while in her old home there was a dish put aside expressly for the Rover of the Plain.  The buffalo bore it as long as he could; but, one day, when his mistress bade him go to the lake and fetch water, his knees almost gave way from hunger.  He kept silence, however, till the evening, when he said to his mistress:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1256'>"I am nearly starved; I have not touched food since I came here.  I can work no more."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1257'>"Alas!" answered she, "what can I do?  I have only one dish in the house.  You will have to steal some beans from the fields.  Take a few here and a few there; but be sure not to take too many from one place, or the owner may notice it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1258'>Now the buffalo had always lived an honest life, but if his mistress did not feed him, he must get food for himself.  So that night, when all the village was asleep, he came out from the wood and ate a few beans here and a few there, as his mistress had bidden him.  And when at last his hunger was satisfied, he crept back to his lair.  But a buffalo is not a fairy, and the next morning, when the women arrived to work in the fields, they stood still with astonishment, and said to each other:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1259'>"Just look at this; a savage beast has been destroying our crops, and we can see the traces of his feet!"  And they hurried to their homes to tell their tale.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1261'>"They perceived what happened, of course; so to-night you had better seek your supper further off."  And the buffalo nodded his head and followed her counsel; but in the morning, when these women also went out to work, the races of hoofs were plainly to be seen, and they hastened to tell their husbands, and begged them to bring their guns, and to watch for the robber.</paragraph>

But, as unluckily often happens, the one to whom she owed the most, the crab-fairy, was forgotten, and by this, as in the case of other babies you have read about, much mischief was wrought.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1322'>However, for the moment all was gaiety in the palace, and everybody inside ran to the windows to watch the fairies" carriages, for no two were alike.  One had a car of ebony, drawn by white pigeons, another was lying back in her ivory chariot, driving ten black crows, while the rest had chosen rare woods or many-coloured sea-shells, with scarlet and blue macaws, long-tailed peacocks, or green love-birds for horses. These carriages were only used on occasions of state, for when they went to war flying dragons, fiery serpents, lions or leopards, took the place of the beautiful birds.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1323'>The fairies entered the queen"s chamber followed by little dwarfs who carried their presents and looked much prouder than their mistresses. One by one their burdens were spread upon the ground, and no one had ever seen such lovely things.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1325'>"So I am forgotten!" cried she, in a voice so loud that the queen trembled as she heard it.  "Who was it soothed you in your trouble? Who was it led you to the fairies?  Who was it brought you back in safety to your home again?  Yet I--I--am overlooked, while these who have done nothing in comparison, are petted and thanked."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1326'>The queen, almost dumb with terror, in vain tried to think of some explanation or apology; but there was none, and she could only confess her fault and implore forgiveness.  The fairies also did their best to soften the wrath of their sister, and knowing that, like many plain people who are not fairies, she was very vain, they entreated her to drop her crab"s disguise, and to become once more the charming person they were accustomed to see.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1327'>For some time the enraged fairy would listen to nothing; but at length the flatteries began to take effect.  The crab"s shell fell from her, she shrank into her usual size, and lost some of her fierce expression.</paragraph>

They all loved her dearly, but the fairy Tulip loved her most of all; and as the princess"s fifteenth birthday drew near, the fairy began to tremble lest something terrible should happen--some accident which had not been foreseen.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1334'>These words much displeased the king, who felt that, in breaking off the marriage already arranged he would almost certainly be bringing on his subjects a long and bloody war; so, without answering, he turned away, hoping that a few days might bring his son to reason.

The ambassador was greatly surprised and disappointed, but he knew too much about fairies to venture to disobey them, therefore he had to content himself with presenting the prince"s portrait to the queen, who lost no time in carrying it to the princess.

But, small as she was, she made herself so heavy that, after staggering a few steps under her weight, he laid her down, and tied her fast to a tree with some of the ribbons of his hat.  This done he went away to get help.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1415'>Meanwhile Eglantine had grown very uneasy at the long absence of her mistress, and had come out to look for her.  Just as the prince passed out of sight the fluttering ribbons dance before her eyes, and she descried her beautiful princess bound to a tree.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1419'>To this Eglantine answered nothing; but carefully raising up the doe, she led her slowly to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;eglantine;doe' adjectives='' verbs='answer;raise;lead' valence='5.995' arousal='3.99' dominance='5.5775'>the hut</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1420'>Now both the prince and Becasigue were quite unaware that the old woman had any guests besides themselves, and, following afar, were much surprised to behold Eglantine and her charge enter the cottage.  They lost no time in questioning the old woman, who replied that she knew nothing about the lady and her white doe, who slept next the chamber occupied by the prince and his friend, but that they were very quiet, and paid her well.  Then she went back to her kitchen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1421'>"Do you know," said Becasigue, when they were alone, "I am certain that the lady we saw is the maid of honour to the Princess Desiree, whom I met at the palace.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1425'>These words, low though they were spoken, reached Becasigue, who could hardly believe his ears.  He stood silent for a moment; then, crossing to the window out of which the prince was gazing, he took his arm and led him across the room.

Certainly the little new fish had none.  She had watched jelly-fish and nautilus swimming a little way below the surface, and beautiful coloured sea-weeds floating about; but that was all.  Now, when she plunged deeper her eyes fell upon strange things.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1451'>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, inestimable stones, unvalued jewels-- all scattered in the bottom of the sea!  Dead men"s bones were there also, and long white creatures who had never seen the light, for they mostly dwelt in the clefts of rocks where the sun"s rays could not come.  At first our little fish felt as if she were blind also, but by-and-by she began to make out one object after another in the green dimness, and by the time she had swum for a few hours all became clear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1452'>"Here we are at last," cried a big fish, going down into a deep valley, for the sea has its mountains and valleys just as much as the land.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1453'>"It is beautiful indeed," gasped the little fish, who was very tired with trying to swim as fast as the rest, and beautiful beyond words the palace was.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1454'>"Who are you, and where do you come from?" said she to the little fish, whom the others had pushed in front.  And in a low, trembling voice, the visitor told her story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1455'>"I was once a girl too," answered the queen, when the fish had ended; "and my father was the king of a great country.  A husband was found for me, and on my wedding-day my mother placed her crown on my head and told me that as long as I wore it I should likewise be queen.  For many months I was as happy as a girl could be, especially when I had a little son to play with.  But, one morning, when I was walking in my gardens, there came a giant and snatched the crown from my head. Holding me fast, he told me that he intended to give the crown to his daughter, and to enchant my husband the prince, so that he should not know the difference between us.  Since then she has filled my place and been queen in my stead.  As for me, I was so miserable that I threw myself into the sea, and my ladies, who loved me, declared that they would die too; but, instead of dying, some wizard, who pitied my fate, turned us all into fishes, though he allowed me to keep the face and body of a woman.  And fished we must remain till someone brings me back my crown again!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1456'>"I will bring it back if you tell me what to do!" cried the little fish, who would have promised anything that was likely to carry her up to earth again.

You will find him sitting on the steps weeping for his daughter, who has just died while the prince was away hunting.  At the last she sent her father my crown by a faithful servant.  But I warn you to be careful, for if he sees you he may kill you.  Therefore I will give you the power to change yourself into any creature that may help you best.  You have only to strike your forehead, and call out its name."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1460'>This time the journey to land seemed much shorter than before, and when once the fish reached <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='forehead;fish;journey;tail;time' adjectives='shorter;much' verbs='strike;seem;land;reach;cry' valence='5.313' arousal='3.865' dominance='5.106'>the shore</entity> she struck her forehead sharply with her tail, and cried:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1462'>In a moment the small, slimy body disappeared, and in its place stood a beautiful beast with branching horns and slender legs, quivering with longing to be gone.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1464'>"By your favour let me go, and do not kill me," said the deer, turning to the prince with tears in her eyes, "for I have far to run and much to do."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1465'>"That can"t really be a deer," thought the prince to himself, reining in his horse and not attempting to follow her.  "No deer ever had eyes like that.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1466'>The deer reached the giant"s castle quite out of breath, and her heart sank as she gazed at the tall, smooth walls which surrounded it.  Then she plucked up courage and cried:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1468'>It was wonderful how fast she went, that little creature!  The wall must have appeared miles high in comparison with her own body; yet, in less time than would have seemed possible, she was over the top and down in the courtyard on the other side.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1471'>Then a pink and grey parrot hopped up to the giant, who by this time was stretching himself and giving yawns which shook the castle.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1472'>On hearing these words the giant leapt out of bed with an angry roar, and sprang at the parrot in order to wring her neck with his great hands.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1473'>"That is true," answered the giant; "but I am not so foolish as to give you that crown for nothing.  Let me think what I will have in exchange!"  And he scratched his huge head for several minutes, for giants" minds always move slowly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1474'>"Ah, yes, that will do!" exclaimed the giant at last, his face brightening.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1475'>Now when the parrot had been a girl she had often heard of this wonderful arch and the precious stones and marbles that had been let into it.  It sounded as if it would be a very hard thing to get them away from the building of which they formed a part, but all had gone well with her so far, and at any rate she could but try.  So she bowed to the giant, and made her way back to the window where the giant could not see her.  Then she called quickly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1476'>"Eagle, come to me!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1477'>Before she had even reached the tree she felt herself borne up on strong wings ready to carry her to the clouds if she wished to go there, and seeming a mere speck in the sky, she was swept along till she beheld the Arch of St.  Martin far below, with the rays of the sun shining on it.  Then she swooped down, and, hiding herself behind a buttress so that she could not be detected from below, she set herself to dig out the nearest blue stones with her beak.  It was even harder work than she had expected; but at last it was done, and hope arose in her heart.  She next drew out a piece of string that she had found hanging from a tree, and sitting down to rest strung the stones together.  When the necklace was finished she hung it round her neck, and called: "Parrot, come to me!"  And a little later the pink and grey parrot stood before <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pink;parrot' adjectives='little;later;grey' verbs='stand' valence='5.84333333333' arousal='4.4' dominance='5.62333333333'>the giant</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1478'>"Here is the necklace you asked for," said the parrot.  And the eyes of the giant glistened as he took the heap of blue stones in his hand. But for all that he was not minded to give up the crown.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1479'>"They are hardly as blue as I expected," he grumbled, though the parrot knew as well as he did that he was not speaking the truth; "so you must bring me something else in exchange for the crown you covet so much. If you fail it will cost you not only the crown but you life also."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1480'>"What is it you want now?" asked the parrot; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='parrot' adjectives='' verbs='ask;answer' valence='6.0625' arousal='4.3075' dominance='5.7925'>the giant</entity> answered:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1482'>The parrot turned away, and as soon as she was outside she murmured:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1483'>"Toad, come to me!"  And sure enough a toad she was, and off she set in search of the starry crown.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1484'>She had not gone far before she came to a clear pool, in which the stars were reflected so brightly that they looked quite real to touch and handle.  Stooping down she filled a bag she was carrying with the shining water and, returning to the castle, wove a crown out of the reflected stars.  Then she cried as before:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1485'>"Parrot, come to me!"  And in the shape of a parrot she entered the presence of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shape;parrot;presence' adjectives='' verbs='enter' valence='5.74166666667' arousal='4.375' dominance='5.69166666667'>the giant</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1486'>"Here is the crown you asked for," she said; and this time the giant could not help crying out with admiration.

And to a monkey, the climb down the tree into the courtyard did not take half a minute.  When she had reached the ground she said again: "Ant, come to me!"

On and on came the fish, holding the crown tightly in her mouth, and the others moved back to let her pass. On she went right up to the queen, who bent and, taking the crown, placed it on her own head.  Then a wonderful thing happened.  Her tail dropped away or, rather, it divided and grew into two legs and a pair of the prettiest feet in the world, while her maidens, who were grouped around her, shed their scales and became girls again.  They all turned and looked at each other first, and next at the little fish who had regained her own shape and was more beautiful than any of them.</paragraph>

Even in his joy at seeing his mother again an air of sadness clung to him, and at last the queen could bear it no longer, and begged him to walk with her in the garden.  Seated together in a bower of jessamine--where she had passed long hours as a bride--she took her son"s hand and entreated him to tell her the cause of his sorrow.

And he flew away to a farmhouse a mile or two off, and brought back a nest of eggs in his strong beak; while the owl, catching up a tin pot, went to a cottage where lived an old woman and her cow, and entering <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='farmhouse;woman;pail;cow;owl;nest;milk;tin;mile;beak;cottage;egg;pot' adjectives='new;strong;old' verbs='fly;bring;live;stand;go;enter;catch;dip' valence='5.69571428571' arousal='3.88685714286' dominance='5.43514285714'>the shed</entity> by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='farmhouse;woman;pail;cow;owl;nest;milk;tin;mile;beak;cottage;egg;pot' adjectives='new;strong;old' verbs='fly;bring;live;stand;go;enter;catch;dip' valence='5.69571428571' arousal='3.88685714286' dominance='5.43514285714'>the window</entity> dipped the pot into the pail of new milk that stood there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1525'>The girls were so much delighted with the kindness and cleverness of their hosts that, when the birds inquired if they would marry them and stay there for ever, they accepted without so much as giving it a second thought.  So the eagle took the younger sister to wife, and the owl the elder, and never was a home more peaceful than theirs!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1526'>All went well for several months, and then the eagle"s wife had a son, while, on the same day, the owl"s wife gave birth to a frog, which she placed directly on the banks of a stream near by, as he did not seem to like the house.  The children both grew quickly, and were never tired of playing together, or wanted any other companions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1527'>One night in the spring, when the ice had melted, and the snow was gone, the sisters sat spinning in the house, awaiting their husbands" return.  But long though they watched, neither the owl nor the eagle ever came; neither that day nor the next, nor the next, nor the next. At last the wives gave up all hope of their return; but, being sensible women, they did not sit down and cry, but called their children, and set out, determined to seek the whole world over till the missing husbands were found.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1528'>Now the women had no idea in which direction the lost birds had gone, but they knew that some distance off was a thick forest, where good hunting was to be found.  It seemed a likely place to find them, or, at any rate, they might hear something of them, and they walked quickly on, cheered by the thought that they were doing something.  Suddenly the younger sister, who was a little in front, gave a cry of surprise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1529'>"Oh! look at that lake!" she said, "we shall never get across it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1530'>"Yes we shall," answered the elder; "I know what to do."  And taking a long piece of string from her pocket, fastened it into the frog"s mouth, like a bit.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1531'>"You must swim across the lake," she said, stooping to put him in, "and we will walk across on the line behind you."  And so they did, till they got to about the middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='middle;frog;boy' adjectives='' verbs='do;stop;get' valence='5.75142857143' arousal='3.59285714286' dominance='5.50428571429'>the lake</entity>, when the frog boy stopped.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1532'>"I don"t like it, and I won"t go any further," cried he sulkily.  And his mother had to promise him all sorts of nice things before he would go on again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1533'>When at last they reached the other side, the owl"s wife untied the line from the frog"s mouth and told him he might rest and play by the lake till they got back from the forest.  Then she and her sister and the boy walked on, with the great forest looming before them.  But they had by this time come far and were very tired, and felt glad enough to see some smoke curling up from a little hut in front of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1534'>"Let us go in and ask for some water," said the eagle"s wife; and in they went.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1535'>The inside of the hut was so dark that at first they could see nothing at all; but presently they heard a feeble croak from one corner.  But sisters turned to look, and there, tied by wings and feet, and their eyes sunken, were the husbands that they sought.  Quick as lightning the wives cut the deer- thongs which bound them; but the poor birds were too weak from pain and starvation to do more than utter soft sounds of joy.  Hardly, however, were they set free, than a voice of thunder made the two sisters jump, while the little boy clung tightly round his mother"s neck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1536'>"What are you doing in my house?" cried she.  And the wives answered boldly that now they had found their husbands they meant to save them from such a wicked witch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1537'>"Well, I will give you your chance," answered the ogress, with a hideous grin; "we will see if you can slide down this mountain.  If you can reach the bottom of the cavern, you shall have your husbands back again."  And as she spoke she pushed them before her out of the door to the edge of a precipice, which went straight down several hundreds of feet.  Unseen by the witch, the frog"s mother fastened one end of the magic line about her, and whispered to the little boy to hold fast the other.  She had scarcely done so when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='round' adjectives='' verbs='do;have;turn' valence='5.15' arousal='3.694' dominance='5.504'>the witch</entity> turned round.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1538'>"You don"t seem to like your bargain," said she; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='t;bargain' adjectives='' verbs='answer;seem;don;like;say' valence='6.38285714286' arousal='4.54' dominance='5.71714285714'>the girl</entity> answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1539'>"Oh, yes, I am quite ready.  I was only waiting for you!"  And sitting down she began her slide.  On, on, she went, down to such a depth that even the witch"s eyes could not follow her; but she took for granted that the woman was dead, and told the sister to take her place.  At that instant, however, the head of the elder appeared above the rock, brought upwards by the magic line.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cord;sister;waist;hand;disgust;time;face;howl;ogress' adjectives='younger' verbs='fasten;hide;look;give' valence='5.61666666667' arousal='4.35733333333' dominance='5.502'>The witch</entity> gave a howl of disgust, and hid her face in her hands; thus giving the younger sister time to fasten the cord to her waist before the ogress looked up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1540'>"You can"t expect such luck twice," she said; and the girl sat down and slid over the edge.  But in a few minutes she too was back again, and the witch saw that she had failed, and feared lest her power was going.  Trembling with rage though she was, she dared not show it, and only laughed hideously.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1541'>"I sha"n"t let my prisoners go as easily as all that!" she said.  "Make my hair grow as thick and as black as yours, or else your husbands shall never see daylight again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1542'>"That is quite simple," replied the elder sister; "only you must do as we did--and perhaps you won"t like the treatment."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1543'>"If you can bear it, of course I can," answered the witch.  And so the girls told her they had first smeared their heads with pitch and then laid hot stones upon them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1544'>"It is very painful," said they, "but there is no other way that we know of.  And in order to make sure that all will go right, one of us will hold you down while the other pours on the pitch."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1545'>And so they did; and the elder sister let down her hair till it hung over the witch"s eyes, so that she might believe it was her own hair growing.  Then the other brought a huge stone, and, in short, there was an end of the witch.  The sisters were savages who had never seen a missionary.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1546'>So when the sisters saw that she was dead they went to the hut, and nursed their husbands till they grew strong.  Then they picked up the frog, and all went to make another home on the other side of the great lake.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1561'>When she understood what was happening the poor young queen was terribly frightened, and, dropping the reins, clung to the side of the chariot.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1562'>A rustling sound near her at length caused her to open her eyes; before her stood a huge woman, almost a giantess, without any clothes save a lion"s skin, which was thrown over her shoulders, while a dried snake"s skin was plaited into her hair.

But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horror' adjectives='' verbs='shrink' valence='4.665' arousal='4.2975' dominance='4.6125'>the queen</entity> shrank back in horror.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1567'>"I am rich enough already," she answered, "but I am often dull, and I think you may amuse me a little."  And, so saying, she changed her shape into that of a lion, and throwing the queen across her back, she went down the ten thousand steps that led to her palace.  The lion had reached the centre of the earth before she stopped in front of a house, lighted with lamps, and built on the edge of a lake of quicksilver.  In this lake various huge monsters might be seen playing or fighting--the queen did not know which-- and around flew rooks and ravens, uttering dismal croaks.  In the distance was a mountain down whose sides waters slowly coursed--these were the tears of unhappy lovers--and nearer the gate were trees without either fruit of flowers, while nettles and brambles covered the ground.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1588'>Just as she had finished speaking the six thousand frogs returned, looking so strange with bees sticking to every part of them that, sad as she felt, the poor queen could not help laughing.

And not content with that the six thousand froggy servants were told to help also, and it was not long before they had built the prettiest little cabin in the world, and made a bed in one corner of dried ferns which they fetched from the top of the ten thousand steps.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1615'>The frog answered nothing at the time, but stopped her game and hopped away among the cypress trees.

Then tearing it off, she gave it to the frog, and they bade each other farewell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1618'>It took the frog a year and four days to mount the ten thousand steps that led to the upper world, but that was because she was still under the spell of a wicked fairy.  By the time she reached the top, she was so tired that she had to remain for another year on the banks of a stream to rest, and also to arrange the procession with which she was to present herself before the king.  For she knew far too well what was due to herself and her relations, to appear at Court as if she was a mere nobody.  At length, after many consultations with her cap, the affair was settled, and at the end of the second year after her parting with <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='affair;length;consultation;cap;parting' adjectives='many' verbs='be;settle;set' valence='5.15083333333' arousal='3.95583333333' dominance='5.53666666667'>the queen</entity> they all set out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1619'>First walked her bodyguard of grasshoppers, followed by her maids of honour, who were those tiny green frogs you see in the fields, each one mounted on a snail, and seated on a velvet saddle.  Next came the water-rats, dressed as pages, and lastly the frog herself, in a litter borne by eight toads, and made of tortoiseshell.  Here she could lie at her ease, with her cap on her head, for it was quite large and roomy, and could easily have held two eggs when the frog was not in it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1620'>The journey lasted seven years, and all this time the queen suffered tortures of hope, though Muffette did her best to comfort her.  Indeed, she would most likely have died had not the Lion Fairy taken a fancy that the child and her mother should go hunting with her in the upper world, and, in spite of her sorrows, it was always a joy to the queen to see the sun again.  As for little Muffette, by the time she was seven her arrows seldom missed their mark.  So, after all, the years of waiting passed more quickly than <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='hope;pass;dare;have;wait' valence='5.79428571429' arousal='4.39857142857' dominance='5.51571428571'>the queen</entity> had dared to hope.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1621'>The frog was always careful to maintain her dignity, and nothing would have persuaded her to show her face in public places, or even along the high road, where there was a chance of meeting anyone.  But sometimes, when the procession had to cross a little stream, or go over a piece of marshy ground, orders would be given for a halt; fine clothes were thrown off, bridles were flung aside, and grasshoppers, water-rats, even the frog herself, spent a delightful hour or two playing in the mud.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1622'>But at length the end was in sight, and the hardships were forgotten in the vision of the towers of the king"s palace; and, one bright morning, the cavalcade entered the gates with all the pomp and circumstance of a royal embassy.  And surely no ambassador had ever created such a sensation!  Door and windows, even the roofs of houses, were filled with people, whose cheers reached the ears of the king.  However, he had no time to attend to such matters just then, as, after nine years, he had at last consented to the entreaties of his courtiers, and was on the eve of celebrating his second marriage.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1629'>"Her remembrance will always be dear to me," answered the king gently, though all present expected him to rebuke the frog severely for her impertinence.  But know, Lady Frog, that a king can seldom do as he wishes, but must be bound by the desires of his subjects.  For nine years I have resisted them; now I can do so no longer, and have made choice of the fair young maiden playing at ball yonder."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1630'>"You cannot wed her, however fair she may be, for the queen your wife is still alive, and sends you this letter written in her own blood," said the frog, holding out the square of handkerchief as she spoke.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1631'>The king turned pale when he heard these words, and his hand trembled so that he could hardly read what the queen had written.  Then he kissed the handkerchief twice or thrice, and burst into tears, and it was some minutes before he could speak.  When at length he found his voice he told his councillors that the writing was indeed that of the queen, and now that he had the joy of knowing she was alive he could, of course, proceed no further with his second marriage.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1867'>The wife said no more; and in truth her heart yearned over the little creatures.  Somehow or other food was never lacking in the hut, and the children grew up and were so good and gentle that, in time, their foster-parents loved them as well or better than their own, who were quarrelsome and envious.  It did not take the orphans long to notice that the boys did not like them, and were always playing tricks on them, so they used to go away by themselves and spend whole hours by the banks of the river.  Here they would take out the bits of bread they had saved from their breakfasts and crumble them for the birds. In return, the birds taught them many things: how to get up early in the morning, how to sing, and how to talk their language, which very few people know.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1868'>But though the little orphans did their best to avoid quarrelling with their foster- brothers, it was very difficult always to keep the peace.  Matters got worse and worse till, one morning, the eldest boy said to the twins:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1870'>The poor children did not answer the insult; but it made them very unhappy.  And they told each other in whispers that they could not stay there any longer, but must go into the world and seek their fortunes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1871'>So next day they arose as early as the birds and stole downstairs without anybody hearing them.  One window was open, and they crept softly out and ran to the side of the river.  Then, feeling as if they had found a friend, they walked along its banks, hoping that by- and-by they should meet some one to take care of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1872'>The whole of that day they went steadily on without seeing a living creature, till, in the evening, weary and footsore, they saw before them a small hut.  This raised their spirits for a moment; but the door was shut, and the hut seemed empty, and so great was their disappointment that they almost cried.  However, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tear' adjectives='' verbs='say;fight' valence='4.6075' arousal='4.9175' dominance='5.685'>the boy</entity> fought down his tears, and said cheerfully:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1874'>Then they sat down, and for some time they were too tired even to notice anything; but by-and-by they saw that under the tiles of the roof a number of swallows were sitting, chattering merrily to each other.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1875'>"Good evening, my fine city madam," remarked a swallow, whose manners were rather rough and countryfied to another who looked particularly distinguished.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1876'>"I have inherited this nest from my parents," replied the other, "and as they left it to me I certainly shall make it my home.  But," she added politely, "I hope that you and all your family are well?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1883'>"Yes, it was.  And worse than that, the crested lark, that was formerly so timid and shy, is now no better than a thief, and steals maize and corn whenever she can find them."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1890'>"Of course not," answered the city lady, with some contempt for their stupidity.

But never will she betray the place where the Bird of Truth is hidden, for she hates him, and would kill him if she could; knowing well, however, that this bird cannot die, as he is immortal, she keeps him closely shut up, and guarded night and day by the Birds of Bad Faith, who seek to gag him so that his voice should not be heard."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1904'>"And is there no one else who can tell the poor boy where to find the bird, if he should ever manage to reach the tower?" asked <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask;swallow' valence='5.88666666667' arousal='3.65666666667' dominance='6.12'>the country</entity> swallow.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1906'>Then the swallow flew away, and the children, who had forgotten both hunger and weariness in the joy of this strange news, rose up and followed in the direction of her flight.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1907'>It was scarcely light the next morning before the girl was sweeping out the rooms, and the boy watering the garden, so that by the time the good woman came downstairs there was nothing left for her to do.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1971'>Now, although the mink could not run as fast as the wolves, he had a good start, and was already afloat when the swiftest among them threw themselves into the nearest canoe.  They pushed off, but as they dipped the paddles into the water, they snapped as the bows had done, and were quite useless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1972'>"I know where there are some new ones," cried a young fellow, leaping on shore and rushing to a little cave at the back of the beach.  And the mink"s heart smote him when he heard, for he had not known of this secret store.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1973'>After a long chase the wolves managed to surround their prey, and the mink, seeing it was no good resisting any more, gave himself up.  Some of the elder wolves brought out some cedar bands, which they always carried wound round their bodies, but the mink laughed scornfully at the sight of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1974'>"Why I could snap those in a moment," said he; "if you want to make sure that I cannot escape, better take a line of kelp and bind me with that."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1975'>"You are right," answered the grandfather; "your wisdom is greater than ours."  And he bade his servants gather enough kelp from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='servant;line;kelp;none' adjectives='enough' verbs='bring;bid;gather;make;have' valence='5.305' arousal='3.779' dominance='5.453'>the rocks</entity> to make a line, as they had brought none with them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1976'>"While the line is being made you might as well let me have one last dance," remarked the mink.  And the wolves replied: "Very good, you may have your dance; perhaps it may amuse us as well as you."  So they brought two canoes and placed them one beside the other.  The mink stood up on his hind legs and began to dance, first in one canoe and then in the other; and so graceful was he, that the wolves forgot they were going to put him to death, and howled with pleasure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1977'>"Pull the canoes a little apart; they are too close for this new dance," he said, pausing for a moment.  And the wolves separated them while he gave a series of little springs, sometime pirouetting while he stood with one foot on the prow of both.  "Now nearer, now further apart," he would cry as the dance went on.  "No! further still."  And springing into the air, amidst howls of applause, he came down head-foremost, and dived to the bottom.  And through the wolves, whose howls had now changed into those of rage, sought him everywhere, they never found him, for he hid behind a rock till they were out of sight, and then made his home in another forest.</paragraph>

But the leader killed most, as he was the best shot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1987'>"Now we must cut up the game and divide it," said he; and so they did, each one taking his own share; and, walking one behind the other, set out for the village.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1990'>"Have I ever done that, that you put me such a question?" asked the youth.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1991'>So the old man rose and went, and strapped the meat on his shoulder; but as he was crossing the ford the strap broke and the pack fell into the river.  He stooped to catch it, but it swirled past him.  He clutched again; but in doing so he over- balanced himself and was hurried into some rapids, where he was knocked against some rocks, and he sank and was drowned, and his body was carried down the stream into smoother water when it rose to the surface again.  But by this time it had lost all likeness to a man, and was changed into a piece of wood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1992'>The wood floated on, and the river got bigger and bigger and entered a new country.  There it was borne by the current close to the shore, and a woman who was down there washing her clothes caught it as it passed, and drew it out, saying to herself: "What a nice smooth plank!  I will use it as a table to put my food upon."  And gathering up her clothes she took the plank with her into her hut.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1993'>When her supper time came she stretched the board across two strings which hung from the roof, and set upon it the pot containing a stew that smelt very good.

But what was her astonishment and disgust when both pot and food vanished instantly before her!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1994'>"Oh, you horrid plank, you have brought me ill-luck!" she cried.  And taking it up she flung it away from her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1995'>The woman had been surprised before at the disappearance of her food, but she was more astonished still when, instead of the plank, she beheld a baby.  However, she was fond of children and had none of her own, so she made up her mind that she would keep it and take care of it.  The baby grew and throve as no baby in that country had ever done, and in four days he was a man, and as tall and strong as any brave of the tribe.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1998'>It took him many days to get there, and when he saw his son sitting in his place his anger was kindled, and his heart was stirred to take vengeance upon him.  So he went out quickly into the forest and shed tears, and each tear became a bird.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2000'>The two went out together, and after walking for about half an hour they old man stopped.  "That is the tree," he said.  And the son began to climb it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2001'>Now a strange thing happened.  The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be, and when he looked down the earth below appeared no bigger than a star.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bird;something' adjectives='longer' verbs='be;feel;drag;try;see;go' valence='5.65222222222' arousal='3.87' dominance='5.58888888889'>Sill</entity> he tried to go back, but he could not, and though he could not see the birds any longer he felt as if something were dragging him up and up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2002'>He thought that he had been climbing that tree for days, and perhaps he had, for suddenly a beautiful country, yellow with fields of maize, stretched before him, and he gladly left the top of the tree and entered it.  He walked through the maize without knowing where he was going, when he heard a sound of knocking, and saw two old blind women crushing their food between two stones.  He crept up to them on tiptoe, and when one old woman passed her dinner to the other he held out his hand and took it and ate if for himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2003'>"How slow you are kneading that cake," cried the other old woman at last.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2006'>"I certainly thought you took it from me; but here is some more."  And again the young man stretched out his hand; and the two old women fell to quarrelling afresh.  But when it happened for the third time the old women suspected some trick, and one of them exclaimed:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2007'>"I am sure there is a man here; tell me, are you not my grandson?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2008'>"Yes," answered the young man, who wished to please her, "and in return for your good dinner I will see if I cannot restore your sight; for I was taught in the art of healing by the best medicine man in the tribe."  And with that he left them, and wandered about till he found the herb which he wanted.  Then he hastened back to the old women, and begging them to boil him some water, he threw the herb in.  As soon as the pot began to sing he took off the lid, and sprinkled the eyes of the women, and sight came back to them once more.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2009'>There was no night in that country, so, instead of going to bed very early, as he would have done in his own hut, the young man took another walk.  A splashing noise near by drew him down to a valley through which ran a large river, and up a waterfall some salmon were leaping. How their silver sides glistened in the light, and how he longed to catch some of the great fellows!  But how could he do it?  He had beheld no one except the old women, and it was not very likely that they would be able to help him.  So with a sigh he turned away and went back to them, but, as he walked, a thought struck him.  He pulled out one of his hairs which hung nearly to his waist, and it instantly became a strong line, nearly a mile in length.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2010'>"Weave me a net that I may catch some salmon," said he.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2011'>At last, one day, when he was eating his dinner, the old woman who always spoke first, said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2012'>"We have been very glad to see you, grandson, but now it is time that you went home."  And pushing aside a rock, he saw a deep hole, so deep that he could not see to the bottom.  Then they dragged a basket out of the house, and tied a rope to it.  "Get in, and wrap this blanket round your head," said they; "and, whatever happens, don"t uncover it till you get to the bottom."  Then they bade him farewell, and he curled himself up in the basket.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2013'>Down, down, down he went; would he ever stop going?  But when the basket did stop, the young man forgot what he had been told, and put his head out to see what was the matter.  In an instant the basket moved, but, to his horror, instead of going down, he felt himself being drawn upwards, and shortly after he beheld the faces of the old women.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2014'>"You will never see your wife and son if you will not do as you are bid," said they.  "Now get in, and do not stir till you hear a crow calling."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2040'>Unluckily, however, one day, when Lyma was left by herself in the hut, the three Stalos came down and carried her and the reindeer off to their own cottage.  The country was very lonely, and perhaps no one would have known in which direction she had gone had not the girl managed to tie a ball of thread to the handle of a door at the back of the cottage and let it trail behind her.

But no voice answered them; and they fell to searching all about, lest perchance their sister might have dropped some clue to guide them.  At length their eyes dropped on the thread which lay on the snow, and they set out to follow it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2042'>On and on they went, and when at length the thread stopped the brothers knew that another day"s journey would bring them to the Stalos" dwelling.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2049'>Then Lyma took up her buckets and carried them into the house, and did as her brothers had told her.  They were so hungry that they ate the food up greedily without speaking, but when there was nothing left in the pot, the eldest one said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2052'>It had happened that on this very evening the Stalos had driven in some of the reindeer from the pasture, and had tied them up to the wall of the house so that they might be handy to kill for next day"s dinner. The two Sodnos had seen what they were doing, and where the beasts were secured; so, at midnight, when all was still, they crept down from their tree and seized the reindeer by the horns which were locked together.  The animals were frightened, and began to neigh and kick, as if they were fighting together, and the noise became so great that even the eldest Stalo was awakened by it, and that was a thing which had never occurred before.  Raising himself in his bed, he called to his youngest brother to go out and separate the reindeer or they would certainly kill themselves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2053'>The young Stalo did as he was bid, and left the house; but no sooner was he out of the door than he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Sodnos, and fell without a groan.  Then they went back to worry the reindeer, and the noise became as great as ever, and a second time the Stalo awoke.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2054'>"The boy does not seem to be able to part the beasts," he cried to his second brother; "go and help him, or I shall never get to sleep."  So the brother went, and in an instant was struck dead as he left the house by the sword of the eldest Sodno.  The Stalo waited in bed a little longer for things to get quiet, but as the clatter of the reindeer"s horns was as bad as ever, he rose angrily from his bed muttering to himself:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2055'>"It is extraordinary that they cannot unlock themselves; but as no one else seems able to help them I suppose I must go and do it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2056'>Rubbing his eyes, he stood up on the floor and stretched his great arms and gave a yawn which shook the walls.  The Sodnos heard it below, and posted themselves, one at the big door and one at the little door at the back, for they did not know what their enemy would come out at.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2057'>The Stalo put out his hand to take his iron mantle from the bed, where it always lay, but the mantle was no there.  He wondered where it could be, and who could have moved it, and after searching through all the rooms, he found it hanging over the kitchen fire.  But the first touch burnt him so badly that he let it alone, and went with nothing, except a stick in his hand, through the back door.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2058'>The young Sodno was standing ready for him, and as the Stalo passed the threshold struck him such a blow on the head that he rolled over with a crash and never stirred again.  The two Sodnos did not trouble about him, but quickly stripped the younger Stalos of their clothes, in which they dressed themselves.  Then they sat still till the dawn should break and they could find out from the Stalos" mother where the treasure was hidden.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2059'>With the first rays of the sun the young Sodno went upstairs and entered the old woman"s room.  She was already up and dressed, and sitting by the window knitting, and the young man crept in softly and crouched down on the floor, laying his head on her lap.  For a while he kept silence, then he whispered gently:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2060'>"Tell me, dear mother, where did my eldest brother conceal his riches?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2061'>"What a strange question!  Surely you must know," answered she.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2063'>"He dug a hole under the doorstep and placed it there," said she.  And there was another pause.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2064'>By-and-by the Sodno asked again:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2065'>"And where may my second brother"s money be?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2070'>But at this question the old woman flew into a passion, and vowed that if she could find a rod she would bring his memory back to him.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2085'>Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings.  The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion, and thought that there was no one like him in the world, till, by-and-by, it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp, Andras Baive by name, who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff.  Of course not a creature in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='course;mountaineer;nonsense;creature' adjectives='such;happier' verbs='make;believe;let;declare;talk' valence='5.77625' arousal='3.9725' dominance='5.74625'>Vadso</entity> believed that, and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense, why, let them!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2086'>The winter was long and cold, and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive, when suddenly, on a frosty day, he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso.  The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength, and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour.  As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore, and his face shone with pleasure.  "That is the very thing," laughed he, "I will make him jump over that boat." Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge, and they soon settled the terms of the wager.  He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner, and would get a large sum of money as the prize.  So, followed by many of the villagers, the two men walked down to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='villager;man' adjectives='many' verbs='follow;walk' valence='5.974' arousal='3.498' dominance='5.27'>the sea</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2087'>An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play, and to hold the stakes, and Andras, as the stranger was told to jump first.  Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place, he ran forward, with his head well thrown back, and cleared the boat with a mighty bound.  The lookers- on cheered him, and indeed he well deserve it; but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do.  On he came, taller than Andras by several inches, but heavier of build.  He too sprang high and well, but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat. Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk, but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='townsfolk;silence' adjectives='dead' verbs='say;laugh;reign' valence='5.228' arousal='4.522' dominance='5.756'>Andras</entity> only laughed and said carelessly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2088'>"Just a little too short, bailiff; next time you must do better than that."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2089'>The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival"s scornful words, and answered quickly: "Next time you will have something harder to do." And turning his back on his friends, he went sulkily home.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pocket;money;home' adjectives='' verbs='put;go;earn;have' valence='6.36' arousal='4.53285714286' dominance='6.17142857143'>Andras</entity>, putting the money he had earned in his pocket, went home also.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2090'>The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso.  A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off; and the bailiff, disguising himself as a Stalo, or ogre, called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boy;ogre;enemy;dog;bailiff;son;stalo;mile;place;fiord' adjectives='few' verbs='be;disguise;call;have;meet;hasten;tell;row' valence='5.28869565217' arousal='4.16652173913' dominance='5.24130434783'>the boy</entity> had met <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boy;ogre;enemy;dog;bailiff;son;stalo;mile;place;fiord' adjectives='few' verbs='be;disguise;call;have;meet;hasten;tell;row' valence='5.28869565217' arousal='4.16652173913' dominance='5.24130434783'>Andras</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2091'>Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands, thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump.  He wandered on, his eyes fixed on the sands, so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock, while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves. A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself, and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage.  "Dear me!  I may find some use for that," he said; and hastened down to the sea, waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him.  Suddenly--he could not have told why--a nameless fear seized upon him, and he fled away from the shore as if for his life.  As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe, such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use; and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat: "Next time you will have something harder to do."  So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen, but the bailiff himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2092'>It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain, where the sun never set, and it was very difficult to get to sleep, Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic, and this stood him in good stead now.  The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer, and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles.  Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing.  Nothing he could see, but to his ears the notes of a pipe floated over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;note;ear;pipe' adjectives='' verbs='see;float;draw;listen' valence='5.80555555556' arousal='3.66444444444' dominance='5.81555555556'>the plain</entity>, and ever, as he listened, it drew nearer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2093'>A cold shiver shook Andras, and this time he wished himself the feet of a reindeer calf.  For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor bird can come near him.  A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things living.  Yes; but not so swift as a Stalo, as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stalo;pipe;playing' adjectives='swift' verbs='hear;stop;find;rest' valence='5.9' arousal='3.93714285714' dominance='5.85'>Andras</entity> found out when he stopped to rest, and heard the pipe playing!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2094'>For a moment his heart sank, and he gave himself up for dead, till he remembered that, not far off, were two little lakes joined together by a short though very broad river.  In the middle of the river lay a stone that was always covered by water, except in dry seasons, and as the winter rains had been very heavy, he felt quite sure that not even the top of it could be seen.  The next minute, if anyone had been looking that way, he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding northwards, and by-and-by giving a great spring, which landed him in the midst of the stream.  But, instead of sinking to the bottom, he paused a second to steady himself, then gave a second spring which landed him on the further shore.  He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down and began to neigh loudly, so that the Stalo might know exactly where he was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2095'>"Ah!  There you are," cried the Stalo, appearing on the opposite bank; "for a moment I really thought I had lost you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2096'>"No such luck," answered Andras, shaking his head sorrowfully.  By this time he had taken his own shape again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2097'>"Well, but I don"t see how I am to get to you1" said the Stalo, looking up and down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2098'>"Jump over, as I did," answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='jump' adjectives='easy' verbs='answer;do;be' valence='6.1' arousal='4.17666666667' dominance='5.885'>Andras</entity>; "it is quite easy."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2099'>"But I could not jump this river; and I don"t know how you did," replied the Stalo.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2100'>"I should be ashamed to say such things," exclaimed Andras.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2101'>The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words, just as Andras meant him to do.  He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river.  Not that that would have mattered, for he was a good swimmer; but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries, and took aim at him.  His aim was good, but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet.  A second shot, directed at his forehead, fared no better, for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb.  Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stalo;rib;s;instant;arrow' adjectives='little' verbs='aim;spring;head;hit' valence='5.54083333333' arousal='4.31666666667' dominance='5.47083333333'>Andras</entity> aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo"s head, and when he sprang up, just an instant too soon, it hit him between the ribs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2102'>Mortally wounded as he was, the Stalo was not yet dead, and managed to swim to the shore.  Stretching himself on the sand, he said slowly to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sand' adjectives='' verbs='stretch;say' valence='5.69' arousal='4.19666666667' dominance='5.97666666667'>Andras</entity>:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2104'>Then he died; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and found the dog and boy.  The dog, a fierce, wicked-looking creature, he slew with one blow from his fist, for it is well known that if a Stalo"s dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master"s wounds the Stalo comes to life again.  That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his dog; but the bailiff, being only half a Stalo, had forgotten him, when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras. Next, Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets, and bidding the boy get in, pushed it off from the shore, leaving the little craft to drift as it would, while he himself ran home.  With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer; and he soon married a rich wife, whose parents would not have him as a son-in-law when he was poor, and the two lived happy for ever after.</paragraph>

It was absurd to imagine that the apothecary"s nephew could ever marry the king"s daughter; so he did his best to forget her, and study harder than before, till the royal proclamation suddenly filled him with hope.  When he was free he no longer spent the precious moments poring over books, but, like the rest, he might have been seen wandering along the banks of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='rest;water;glass;moment;book;something;diving;pebble;bit;bank' adjectives='precious;white;clear;free' verbs='be;glisten;pore;wander;turn;see;lay;have;spend' valence='6.21607142857' arousal='3.80178571429' dominance='5.61928571429'>the river</entity>, or diving into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='rest;water;glass;moment;book;something;diving;pebble;bit;bank' adjectives='precious;white;clear;free' verbs='be;glisten;pore;wander;turn;see;lay;have;spend' valence='6.21607142857' arousal='3.80178571429' dominance='5.61928571429'>the stream</entity> after something that lay glistening in the clear water, but which turned out to be a white pebble or a bit of glass.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2168'>There is an old proverb which says: "Everything comes to him who knows how to wait."  It is not all men who know hot to wait, any more than it is all men who can learn by experience; but Gilguerillo was one of the few and instead of thinking his life wasted because he could not have the thing he wanted most, he tried to busy himself in other directions.  So, one day, when he expected it least, his reward came to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2169'>He happened to be reading a book many hundreds of years old, which told of remedies for all kinds of diseases.  Most of them, he knew, were merely invented by old women, who sought to prove themselves wiser than other people; but at length he came to something which caused him to sit up straight in his chair, and made his eyes brighten.  This was the description of a balsam-- which would cure every kind of sore or wound--distilled from a plant only to be found in a country so distant that it would take a man on foot two months to go and come back again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2170'>When I say that the book declared that the balsam could heal every sort of sore or wound, there were a few against which it was powerless, and it gave certain signs by which these might be known.  This was the reason why Gilguerillo demanded to see the king"s foot before he would undertake to cure it; and to obtain admittance he gave out that he was a shoemaker.  However, the dreaded signs were absent, and his heart bounded at the thought that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thought;heart;reach;sign' adjectives='absent;dreaded' verbs='be;bound' valence='5.502' arousal='4.242' dominance='5.198'>the princess</entity> was within his reach.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2172'>He spared his horse only so much as was needful, yet it took him six days to reach the spot where the plant grew.  A thick wood lay in front of him, and, fastening the bridle tightly to a tree, he flung himself on his hands and knees and began to hunt for the treasure.  Many time he fancied it was close to him, and many times it turned out to be something else; but, at last, when light was fading, and he had almost given up hope, he came upon a large bed of the plant, right under his feet!  Trembling with joy, he picked every scrap he could see, and placed it in his wallet.  Then, mounting his horse, he galloped quickly back towards <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse' adjectives='' verbs='mount;gallop' valence='5.704' arousal='4.066' dominance='5.292'>the city</entity>.</paragraph>

After that he lay down and slept soundly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2174'>The sun was shining when he awoke, and he jumped up and ran to the pot.  The plant had disappeared and in its stead was a thick syrup, just as the book had said there would be.

He next washed himself thoroughly, and dressed himself, in his best clothes, and putting the flask in his pocket, set out for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='flask;pocket;delay;clothes' adjectives='best' verbs='set;beg;wash;see;put;dress' valence='5.51833333333' arousal='3.995' dominance='5.47583333333'>the palace</entity>, and begged to see <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='flask;pocket;delay;clothes' adjectives='best' verbs='set;beg;wash;see;put;dress' valence='5.51833333333' arousal='3.995' dominance='5.47583333333'>the king</entity> without delay.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2192'>For many hours he trudged on merrily, now and then stopping to drink from some clear spring or to pick some ripe fruit from a tree.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2195'>"Well, that"s true enough," answered the other mildly.  "And where are you going?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2199'>This seemed to Hans to be easy enough; so he agreed to enter the old man"s service, and they set out together.  On their way they crossed a deep valley and came to a mountain, where the man opened a trapdoor, and bidding Hans follow him, he crept in and began to go down a long flight of steps.  When they got to the bottom Hans saw a large number of rooms lit by many lamps and full of beautiful things.  While he was looking round the old man said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2200'>"Now you know what you have to do.  You must keep these rooms clean, and strew sand on the floor every day.  Here is a table where you will always find food and drink, and there is your bed.  You see there are a great many suits of clothes hanging on the wall, and you may wear any you please; but remember that you are never to open this locked door. If you do ill will befall you.  Farewell, for I am going away again and cannot tell when I may return.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2201'>No sooner had the old man disappeared than Hans sat down to a good meal, and after that went to bed and slept until the morning.  At first he could not remember what had happened to him, but by-and-by he jumped up and went into all the rooms, which he examined carefully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2202'>"How foolish to bid me to put sand on the floors," he thought, "when there is nobody here by myself!  I shall do nothing of the sort."  And so he shut the doors quickly, and only cleaned and set in order his own room.  And after the first few days he felt that that was unnecessary too, because no one came there to see if the rooms where clean or not. At last he did no work at all, but just sat and wondered what was behind the locked door, till he determined to go and look for himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2203'>The key turned easily in the lock.  Hans entered, half frightened at what he was doing, and the first thing he beheld was a heap of bones. That was not very cheerful; and he was just going out again when his eye fell on a shelf of books.  Here was a good way of passing the time, he thought, for he was fond of reading, and he took one of the books from the shelf.  It was all about magic, and told you how you could change yourself into anything in the world you liked.  Could anything be more exciting or more useful?  So he put it in his pocket, and ran quickly away out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pocket;door' adjectives='little;open' verbs='put;be;run;have;leave' valence='5.72909090909' arousal='4.17909090909' dominance='5.73363636364'>the mountain</entity> by a little door which had been left open.</paragraph>

The butcher got ready his pole-axe; but just as he was going to strike, the cow changed itself into a dove and flew away, and the butcher stood staring after it as if he were turned to stone.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2234'>Kirsten, of course, was delighted at this new piece of good fortune, and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought.  This time <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='farm;time' adjectives='fine' verbs='consent;have' valence='5.93333333333' arousal='3.78666666667' dominance='5.58666666667'>Peder</entity> consented, and soon they had quite a fine farm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2235'>Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase, and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse.  The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together, and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors.  The day was hot, and both men were thirsty, and, besides, they had much to say; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking.  Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water, and, being a kind- hearted lass, she gave some to the horse to drink.  What was her surprise when the animal said to her: "Take off my bridle and you will save my life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2236'>"I dare not," said she; "your master will be so angry."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2237'>"He cannot hurt you," answered the horse, "and you will save my life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2238'>At that she took off the bridle; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house.  Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove.  Over the woods and fields they went, and at length they reached a king"s palace surrounded by beautiful gardens.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='garden;gold;rose;foot;attendant;ring' adjectives='' verbs='fall;be;dive;turn;walk' valence='6.22076923077' arousal='3.94461538462' dominance='5.58230769231'>The princess</entity> was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2239'>"Why, here is a ring!" she cried, "where could it have come from?"  And picking it up she put it on her finger.  As she did so the hill-man lost his power over <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;cow;power;hill-man;dog;course' adjectives='' verbs='do;be;dive;understand;have;lose' valence='5.83454545455' arousal='3.99090909091' dominance='5.69272727273'>Hans</entity>--for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog, the cow, the horse and the dove.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2240'>"Well, that is really strange," said the princess.  "It fits me as though it had been made for me!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2241'>Just at that moment up came <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='moment' adjectives='' verbs='come' valence='5.91333333333' arousal='4.02333333333' dominance='5.82333333333'>the king</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2242'>"Look at what I have found!" cried his daughter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2243'>"Well, that is not worth much, my dear," said he.  "Besides, you have rings enough, I should think."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2244'>"Never mind, I like it," replied <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='reply;mind;like' valence='6.586' arousal='4.662' dominance='5.98'>the princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2245'>But as soon as she was alone, to her amazement, the ring suddenly left her finger and became a man.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2246'>"I am sorry I frightened you," said Hans, when he thought he could safely speak to the princess without making her scream.  "I took refuge with you because the old hill-man, whom I have offended, was trying to kill me, and here I am safe."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2247'>"You had better stay here then," said the princess.  So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;friend;man' adjectives='good' verbs='become;be;stay' valence='6.3' arousal='3.823' dominance='5.894'>Hans</entity> stayed, and he and she became good friends; though, of course, he only became a man when no one else was present.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='2248'>This was all very well; but, one day, as they were talking together, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ring' adjectives='late' verbs='be;happen;change;talk;enter' valence='5.805' arousal='3.87785714286' dominance='5.58'>the king</entity> happened to enter <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ring' adjectives='late' verbs='be;happen;change;talk;enter' valence='5.805' arousal='3.87785714286' dominance='5.58'>the room</entity>, and although <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ring' adjectives='late' verbs='be;happen;change;talk;enter' valence='5.805' arousal='3.87785714286' dominance='5.58'>Hans</entity> quickly changed himself into a ring again it was too late.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2250'>"So this is why you have refused to marry all the kings and princes who have sought your hand?" he cried.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2251'>And, without waiting for her to speak, he commanded that his daughter should be walled up in the summer-house and starved to death with her lover.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2252'>That evening the poor princess, still wearing her ring, was put into the summer-house with enough food to last for three days, and the door was bricked up.  But at the end of a week or two the king thought it was time to give her a grand funeral, in spite of her bad behaviour, and he had the summer-house opened.  He could hardly believe his eyes when he found that the princess was not there, nor Hans either. Instead, there lay at his feet a large hole, big enough for two people to pass through.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2253'>Now what had happened was this.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2254'>When the princess and Hans had given up hope, and cast themselves down on the ground to die, they fell down this hole, and right through the earth as well, and at last they tumbled into a castle built of pure gold at the other side of the world, and there they lived happily.  But of this, of course, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;course' adjectives='' verbs='know' valence='6.41' arousal='3.845' dominance='5.655'>the king</entity> knew nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2255'>"Will anyone go down and see where the passage leads to?" he asked, turning to his guards and courtiers.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2256'>For a long time nobody answered.  The hole was dark and deep, and if it had a bottom no one could see it.  At length a soldier, who was a careless sort of fellow, offered himself for the service, and cautiously lowered himself into the darkness.  But in a moment he, too, fell down, down, down.  Was he going to fall for ever, he wondered! Oh, how thankful he was in the end to reach the castle, and to meet the princess and Hans, looking quite well and not at all as if they had been starved.  They began to talk, and the soldier told them that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='soldier;daughter;back' adjectives='sorry' verbs='be;begin;wish;treat;have;tell;talk' valence='6.058125' arousal='3.849375' dominance='5.63375'>the king</entity> was very sorry for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='soldier;daughter;back' adjectives='sorry' verbs='be;begin;wish;treat;have;tell;talk' valence='6.058125' arousal='3.849375' dominance='5.63375'>the way</entity> he had treated his daughter, and wished day and night that he could have her back again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2257'>Then they all took ship and sailed home, and when they came to the princess"s country, Hans disguised himself as the sovereign of a neighbouring kingdom, and went up to the palace alone.  He was given a hearty welcome by the king, who prided himself on his hospitality, and a banquet was commanded in his honour.  That evening, whilst they sat drinking their wine, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wine' adjectives='' verbs='say;drink;sit' valence='6.22333333333' arousal='4.1' dominance='5.87166666667'>Hans</entity> said to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wine' adjectives='' verbs='say;drink;sit' valence='6.22333333333' arousal='4.1' dominance='5.87166666667'>the king</entity>:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2263'>Then the king fell on his knees and begged for mercy; and as he had in other respects been a good father, they forgave him.  The wedding of Hans and the princess was celebrated with great festivities which lasted a month.

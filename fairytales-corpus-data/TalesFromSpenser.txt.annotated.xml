	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>Faerie Queene. Book I. Cantos I., III., VI.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='44'>Once upon a time, while fairies and goblins still lingered in the forests of Merry England, a great queen named Gloriana reigned over Faeryland. The subjects over whom she ruled were not tiny creatures like <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='court;power;knight;titania;wrong;trouble;subject;creature' adjectives='endowed;magic;tiny' verbs='be;brave;help;rule;redress;go' valence='5.57357142857' arousal='4.71' dominance='5.35571428571'>Oberon</entity> and Titania, but brave knights who went out from her court endowed with magic powers to redress wrongs and help those in trouble.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>Now there lived at this time a king and queen of very ancient lineage, whose dominions stretched from east to west, and who had once held all the world in subjection. But a cruel enemy had arisen against them, and destroyed their rich lands, and killed the inhabitants, and forced the king and queen to take refuge in a strong castle, guarded by a mighty wall of brass. This enemy was no other than a huge and fearful dragon. From every quarter of the globe knights came to fight the accursed beast, but only those whose faith was strong and conscience clear could prevail; and thus knight after knight fell before the dragon, who grew stronger and more cruel in his success.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='46'>The king and queen had one child, a daughter, whose name was Una. She loved her parents dearly, and hearing of the knights of queen Gloriana, she resolved to go to the Faerie Court and pray for assistance for her parents who had now been four years prisoners, and were in great distress. She set out upon her journey, dressed in a long black robe covered by a deep veil; she rode an ass as white as snow, and led by a line a milk-white lamb, a symbol of innocence. Behind her followed a dwarf, bearing a spear in his hand, and leading a war-like steed, on whose back was laid a suit of armour. Thus accoutred, Una appeared at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='una' adjectives='' verbs='appear;accoutr' valence='4.385' arousal='3.835' dominance='4.65'>the court</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='una' adjectives='' verbs='appear;accoutr' valence='4.385' arousal='3.835' dominance='4.65'>Gloriana</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='47'>Shortly before, a young man, tall and powerful, but clownish in appearance, had arrived at the Faerie Court and had prayed to be sent on the first adventure that should arise. When, therefore, Una came and preferred her request, the young man claimed the enterprise as his right. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boldness;armour;enterprise;air;una;length;suit' adjectives='impossible;dangerous' verbs='urge;fit;be;object;try;bring;say;succeed;have;wonder' valence='5.54789473684' arousal='4.37052631579' dominance='5.41105263158'>Gloriana</entity> wondered at his boldness, for he had not a knightly air, and Una herself objected, but he only urged his suit the more, and at length <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boldness;armour;enterprise;air;una;length;suit' adjectives='impossible;dangerous' verbs='urge;fit;be;object;try;bring;say;succeed;have;wonder' valence='5.54789473684' arousal='4.37052631579' dominance='5.41105263158'>Una</entity> said he might try on the armour she had brought, but that, unless it fitted him perfectly, it was impossible he could succeed in so dangerous an enterprise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='48'>Now, the armour which Una had was that of a Christian knight; and when it was tried on, lo! the clownish youth changed into the noblest of all the company. And Queen Gloriana conferred knighthood upon him; and he, mounting the steed led by the dwarf, went forth with Una to vanquish her foe. Henceforth the youth is called the Red-cross knight, for on his silver shield, and on the breast-plate of his armour, was a blood-red cross, the symbol of the Christian faith. And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;danger;cross;una;dread;deed' adjectives='right;faithful;worthy;sober;true;grave;befitting' verbs='be;love;prove;countenance;dread;hold' valence='5.5945' arousal='4.1795' dominance='5.6'>the knight</entity> proved right worthy of his cross: he was true and faithful both in word and deed, and his countenance was grave and sober, befitting one who dreaded no danger, but was himself held in dread; so Una loved him well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>Now, it happened that, shortly after Una and her knight had left the court of Gloriana, they met a grave old man dressed in long black weeds; he had bare feet, and a hoary head, and a book hung from his side; and as he walked, he prayed and smote upon his breast in the manner of a hermit. But he was, instead, a wicked enchanter named Archimago, who, by means of the most cunning tricks, deceived the Red-cross knight, made him think Una an impostor, and beguiled him and also the dwarf away from her. This made the lady very sad, for not only was she lonely and helpless in the strange land through which she was passing, but, unless she could find the knight, she must give up the hope of seeing the cruel dragon subdued and her dear parents set free. So Una, brave as she was good, put away her fears, and travelled on through vast forests and desolate moors, seeking for her knight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='50'>One day, when almost wearied out, Una alighted from her slow-footed steed, and, taking off her robe and unbinding the band which confined her hair, lay down to rest; and so fair and lovely was she that her sweet countenance made sunshine in the shady place in which she lay. Now, while she rested, there suddenly burst out from the forest a lion, hungry and greedy, who, seeing the maiden, ran towards her with jaws wide-open, ready to devour his prey. But, as the lion drew nearer to the maiden, his rage changed into pity, and, amazed at the fair sight before him, he forgot his savage fury and licked her lily hands and kissed her weary feet. And Una, unable at first to cease from the fear of death, watched him, hardly believing her eyes, and then her heart began to melt in gratitude and her tears to flow, as she thought how this fierce lord of beasts pitied her, while her own lord, whom she loved as her very life, had forsaken her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>At length Una checked her tears, and, trying to put away her grief, arose, and, remounting her humble steed, set out again to seek her knight. But she was no longer a defenceless maiden, for with her went the lion--a strong guardian and faithful comrade--who, while she slept, kept both watch and ward, and, while she waked, waited on her will, taking direction from his lady"s eye.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='52'>One day, as the damsel and the lion travelled thus through untrodden deserts, they unexpectedly came upon a beaten path. Following this path, which led under the brow of a steep mountain, Una observed a young girl walking slowly before them, bearing on her shoulder a water-pot. To her Una called, and asked if there were any dwelling-place near at hand. But the girl was rude, and did not reply; indeed, she seemed neither to hear nor understand, and when she saw the lion fear seized upon her, and, throwing down her pitcher, she fled. She dared not once look back, but ran as if her life depended on her speed, until she reached her home, where sat her mother old and blind. This was Corceca, a wicked woman and a hypocrite, who was wont daily to fast and pray and do painful penance. With trembling hands, the girl caught hold of the old woman, and exhibited such signs of terror that her mother rose in great alarm and hastened to close the door just as Una and her strange page arrived. Una prayed hard for admittance, but in vain; and at this the lion lifted his great paws, and, tearing down the wicket door, let his lady in. She found the two women almost dead with fright, crouching in the darkest corner of the hovel. Una tried to calm their fears by gentle words and looks, and after a time succeeded so far as to receive permission to rest there for the night. She was very weary and laid herself down on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='loss;tear;sigh;lion;knight;foot' adjectives='sad;bitter;weary' verbs='be;sleep;lay;groan;spend' valence='4.724375' arousal='3.845' dominance='5.349375'>the floor</entity>--the lion at her feet--but she was too sad for the loss of the Red-cross knight to sleep, and so spent the long hours in sighs and groans and bitter tears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='53'>At length morning approached, and with it came some one knocking at the door. He knocked loud and repeatedly, and was heard to curse and swear because the door was not more readily opened to him. Now, he who knocked was a wicked thief, who robbed churches and stole money from the poor men"s box. At this very moment he had on his back a heavy load of stolen goods, for all that he got, whether by lawful means or unlawful, he brought to this old woman"s house and bestowed upon her daughter Abessa, who was as wicked as herself. There he stood knocking at the door, but neither Abessa nor Corceca dared pass by the lion to open. At length, Kirk-rapine, for such was his name, became quite furious and would wait no longer, but burst open the door. Alas! for Kirk-rapine; the moment he entered, the lion rose from Una"s feet, and, outstretching his lordly paws, laid the robber low. The wretched man was powerless to resist, nor did <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;assistance;piece;blood;man' adjectives='wretched;powerless;dead;lay' verbs='be;do;tear;flow;resist;go;dare' valence='4.80882352941' arousal='4.24705882353' dominance='5.10235294118'>Abessa</entity> or <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;assistance;piece;blood;man' adjectives='wretched;powerless;dead;lay' verbs='be;do;tear;flow;resist;go;dare' valence='4.80882352941' arousal='4.24705882353' dominance='5.10235294118'>Corceca</entity> dare to go to his assistance, and very soon Kirk-rapine lay quite dead--his body torn in pieces, and his blood flowing into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='body;assistance;piece;blood;man' adjectives='wretched;powerless;dead;lay' verbs='be;do;tear;flow;resist;go;dare' valence='4.80882352941' arousal='4.24705882353' dominance='5.10235294118'>the earth</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='54'>Now, when the broad daylight returned, Una arose, and with her the lion, and once more set out together to seek the knight. As soon as she was gone, the women came out from their dark corner, to see whether or not their worst fears were realized. When they saw that Kirk-rapine was indeed slain, they tore their hair, and beat their breasts, and, half mad with malice and revenge, rushed forth in pursuit of Una. As soon as they got near her, they began to shout and cry after her, calling her all sorts of bad names and praying that every kind of evil might befall her. At length, tired out with their own curses, they turned back, and on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='knight;length;curse;armour' adjectives='own' verbs='become;turn;clothe;tire;meet' valence='5.25090909091' arousal='3.60909090909' dominance='5.45909090909'>the way</entity> met one clad in armour as became a knight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='55'>This was, however, no knight, but Archimago, the wicked enchanter, who, not content with having separated Una from her champion, sought to lead her into further distress. He stopped the old woman, and, describing Una, asked if she had seen any such lady. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cursing;s;passion;way' adjectives='' verbs='cry;declare;renew;know;become;tell;take' valence='5.631' arousal='4.302' dominance='5.292'>Thereupon Corceca</entity>"s passion became renewed, and, crying and cursing, she declared she knew her but too well, and told him which way to take.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>Before long, Archimago came where "Una travelled slow," her fierce guardian treading by her side. The sight of the lion alarmed the enchanter, and he turned aside, not daring to approach too near. Now Archimago had taken care to disguise himself as Una"s own Red-cross knight. When, therefore, she recognized the well-known shield, she turned and rode towards him, and, as she approached more near, became assured in her own mind that this was indeed her lost lord. Hastening on, in much humility and with tears in her eyes, she exclaimed: "Ah! my long-lost lord, where have you been so long hidden from my sight?" The pretended knight replied "that his absence had been enforced in that a certain Archimago had sent him on an adventure, from which he had now returned successful, and ready henceforth to abide by her and defend her by land and sea." His words made Una very happy. In her new-found joy, she forgot the pains and toils she had encountered and journeyed on, discoursing happily of all that had befallen her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='57'>They had not, however, travelled far when they saw an armed horseman riding towards them at full speed. Although his horse was covered with foam, the warrior kept spurring it from time to time, and looked as if he were breathing forth dread threats of vengeance on some unknown victim. On his shield his name Sansloy was written in red letters. Now, this Sansloy was a Saracen knight, and was brother of another knight named Sansfoy, but this brother had encountered the Red-cross knight shortly after he and Una left the Faerie Court, and had been slain by him. The moment, therefore, that Sansloy had seen the cross on Archimago"s armour, he had determined to avenge his brother"s death, and bore down thus fiercely on the enchanter and the lady. But Archimago had no mind to fight; he grew faint and fearful when he saw the warrior, and it was only when Una cheered him on that he ventured to couch his spear or put spurs to his horse. Sansloy showed no mercy, but came on with such force and fierceness that his spear went right through Archimago"s shield and hurled his antagonist from his charger, so that he fell heavily to the ground, while the blood gushed from his wound. Immediately Sansloy leapt from his steed and hastened toward his prostrate foe exclaiming, "Lo! there the worthy meed of him who slew Sansfoy with bloody knife," and thereupon began to unlace Archimago"s helmet, thinking to sever his head at one stroke. But Una saw his purport, and cried out, beseeching him to hold "that heavy hand," urging that surely Sansloy"s revenge was enough when he saw his foe lie vanquished at his feet. To her piteous words the cruel Saracen paid no attention, but tore off the other"s helmet, and would have given the fatal blow had he not perceived before him, instead of the Red-cross knight, the hoary head of Archimago the enchanter. He stayed his hand, and gazed on the old man in amazement, for he knew him well, and knew that, skilful as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='magic;hand;charm;amazement;war;man' adjectives='little;used;old;skilful' verbs='be;gaze;know;stay' valence='5.91' arousal='4.34142857143' dominance='5.48571428571'>Archimago</entity> was in charms and magic, he was but little used to war.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>"Why, Archimago," he exclaimed, "what do I see? What hard mishap is this?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='59'>The enchanter answered him never a word, but lay in a trance, apparently dying, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='attempt;enchanter;compassion;trance;assistance;soul;word' adjectives='' verbs='render;die;make;lay;have;answer' valence='5.57857142857' arousal='4.39357142857' dominance='5.52071428571'>Sansloy</entity>, who had no compassion in his soul, made no attempt to render him assistance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>He turned instead to Una, who, poor damsel, was in sore amazement to see that he whom she had believed her own true knight was the cruel enchanter who had caused all her distress. Her wonder soon changed into terror, for Sansloy proceeded to seize hold of her white veil and pluck her rudely from her steed and gaze boldly in her face. But now arose the lion, her fierce servant, and, full of kingly rage at seeing his lady thus maltreated, sprang upon the Saracen, and with sharp-rending claws strove to tear away his shield. But Sansloy was very strong and wary, and, redeeming the shield from the lion"s paws, he drew his sword. Alas! the power of the wild beast was all too weak to withstand a foe armed at every point and so mighty in strength and in skill as Sansloy. Very soon the deadly steel pierced the lion"s heart, and he roared aloud, and life forsook him. Una was left alone in the hands of a cruel warrior, bereft of hope, for her faithful guardian was slain. She knew not where to look for help, and indeed help seemed very far away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>The Saracen would listen to no entreaty, but lifted her on to his own steed and bore her off, while the lowly ass, who would not forsake his lady, followed as best he could. With piteous words, she wept and begged for freedom, but all in vain; her words only increased the hardness of her captor"s heart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>After a time, Una found herself borne into a wild forest. Here the damsel"s terror became extreme, and she cried aloud in her distress. She had no hope of succour, but succour came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>"Eternal providence, exceeding thought,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>Where none appears, can make herself a way."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>And a wondrous way in this case it proved.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>Far off in the wood, a troop of Fauns and Satyrs, wild, untamed inhabitants of deepest forests, were dancing, whilst old Sylvanus, their god, lay sleeping. These, hearing Una"s cry, left their sport, and, running towards the spot from which the cry had come, appeared suddenly on the scene.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>They were a rude, misshapen, even frightful-looking crowd, and Sansloy, like the wicked knight that he was, seized with superstitious fears, took fright and fled. But, when the Satyrs beheld Una all alone, sad and desolate, her fair face stained with tears, they stood still before her, astonished at her beauty, and pitiful of her distress. And she, more amazed than they, began to fear and tremble afresh, for wild stories were told of the Satyrs and of their lawless deeds. And it seemed to her that a worse lot than ever before had now befallen her. So fearful was she that she dared neither speak nor move.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>The wild people read Una"s sorrow in her sad countenance, and, laying aside the rough, frowning looks they usually wore, began to grin and smile and bend their knees before her, trying thus to comfort her. Uncertain whether or not she dare trust herself to them, Una stood irresolute. They, as they watched her, were overcome by pity of her tender youth and wonder at her sovereign beauty, and prostrating themselves on the ground, kissed her feet and fawned upon her with their most kindly looks.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='70'>Then Una, guessing their hearts aright, gave herself up to their care, and, rising, went fearlessly among them. Glad as birds in the joyous spring-time, they led her forth dancing, shouting, singing, and strewing green branches before her. All <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pipe;god;queen;garland' adjectives='olive;merry' verbs='play;lead;crown;echo;ring;worship' valence='6.001875' arousal='4.235' dominance='5.5075'>the way</entity> they played on their merry pipes, until <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pipe;god;queen;garland' adjectives='olive;merry' verbs='play;lead;crown;echo;ring;worship' valence='6.001875' arousal='4.235' dominance='5.5075'>the woods</entity> rang with their echo; and, worshipping <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pipe;god;queen;garland' adjectives='olive;merry' verbs='play;lead;crown;echo;ring;worship' valence='6.001875' arousal='4.235' dominance='5.5075'>the lady</entity> as a queen, they crowned her with an olive garland and led her to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pipe;god;queen;garland' adjectives='olive;merry' verbs='play;lead;crown;echo;ring;worship' valence='6.001875' arousal='4.235' dominance='5.5075'>Sylvanus</entity>, their god.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>He had wondered at the sounds of rejoicing which had roused him from his sleep, but when, leaning on his cypress staff, he came forth from his bower and saw Una, he stood amazed and wondered not when his wood-born subjects fell prostrate before her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='72'>And then came tree-nymphs and light-footed Naiads, flocking to see the new-comer. But when they saw how fair and good she was, sharp envy seized upon them, and they fled away lest the Satyrs, in their new-born reverence for Una, should scorn their ancient playmates.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='73'>So Una, thankful for the favour she found and the respect shown to her, remained a long time among this forest people, and rested from her weariness. In return for their hospitality, she tried to teach them something of truth, and to prevent their worship of herself, but it was in vain, for when they found they might not worship <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ass;return;steed;stead;something;truth;hospitality;worship' adjectives='vain;lowly;milk-white' verbs='prevent;be;worship;try;turn;teach;find' valence='5.9375' arousal='3.756875' dominance='5.49'>the lady</entity>, they turned to the milk-white ass, her lowly steed, and worshipped it in her stead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>One day there came to the forest a certain Sir Satyrane, a noble knight who had been born in these woods, and who was in the habit of revisiting them from time to time. Now, when he came unexpectedly on this fair lady sitting among the Satyrs and endeavouring to teach them true sacred lore, he wondered at her heavenly wisdom, the like of which he had never before seen in woman.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>This was a most welcome sight, and yet Una"s heart sank within her as she looked at the dwarf, for he travelled alone and carried with him the silver shield, the mighty spear and ancient armour of the Red-cross Knight. Seeing these, she fell helpless to the ground, for she knew some terrible misfortune must have happened to her lord.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>The dwarf, as he drew near and beheld his lady in such distress, became as sorrowful as she; for he bore heavy tidings and feared greatly to impart them. His heart sank within him, but he made a show of hopefulness and set about to rub and chafe the poor damsel"s temples until she began to give signs of life, and to moan and groan aloud. She was very weary, and she thought her effort to save her parents was all in vain. Loathing the very sunshine she cried out for death, and, believing her prayers about to be answered, once more sank upon the ground.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='83'>Then the dwarf began to relate all the adventures which had happened to him and the knight from the time that Archimago, the wicked enchanter, had parted them from Una until now.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='85'>It was thus he came to trust in Duessa, a wicked witch, who one day led him to rest by a stream whose waters had the fatal effect of rendering every one who drank of them weak and powerless against all attacks of evil. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='strength;water;courage;blood;way;root;chill' adjectives='slow' verbs='strike;drink;run;rest;give' valence='5.92733333333' arousal='4.306' dominance='5.51666666667'>The knight</entity>, then, resting by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='strength;water;courage;blood;way;root;chill' adjectives='slow' verbs='strike;drink;run;rest;give' valence='5.92733333333' arousal='4.306' dominance='5.51666666667'>the stream</entity>, drank of its waters, and immediately his strength gave way, his blood ran slow, and a chill struck at the very root of his courage.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>The giant struck with a force that might overthrow a tower of stone, much more a defenceless man: but the knight watched carefully where the blows fell, and skilfully leapt out of their way, and thus for a time evaded them.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='89'>The giant was not slow to see his advantage. He uplifted his powerful arm, and with one stroke would have made an end of his opponent had not Duessa interfered.

At length, when the first passion of grief had worn itself out, she rose, and, attended by the dwarf, resolved to find her knight, alive or dead. But ever as she wandered through low dales, and over high hills and among thick woods, her grief broke forth from time to time as if from a wound that had not healed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>After a time Una and her dwarf chanced to meet a very noble-looking knight attended by a single follower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>These were none other than the great and good Prince Arthur and Timias his much loved squire. The armour of the Prince glittered from afar, and on his breast he wore a bauldric beset with precious stones, in the midst of which shone one shaped like a lady"s head, which was of wondrous worth and was possessed of magic powers. By the bauldric hung the Prince"s sword: its sheath was of ivory curiously wrought. The hilt and the buckle were of burnished gold and the handle was of mother-of-pearl. His helmet was also of gold and had a dragon for its crest: the wings of the dragon spread wide apart, while its head couched close upon the Prince"s beaver, and its tail stretched low upon his back, and on the top of all was a tuft of divers coloured hair sprinkled with gold and pearls, and quivering in the sunlight. His shield was closely covered and might not be seen of mortal eyes, for it was made of pure and perfect diamond:--one massive piece cut solid from the rock, and no spear could pierce it nor any sword divide its substance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='94'>And never did Prince Arthur reveal its brightness to any single foe, but if he wished to dismay huge monsters or daunt whole armies, then would he discover its exceeding brightness, and so discomfit them.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>Timias, the Prince"s squire, was a gentle youth. He bore a spear of ebony, with a square pike head, which had been three times heated in the furnace; and he rode a proud and stubborn steed that chafed under its rider, but was kept well in hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>As Prince Arthur approached the lady, he spoke courteously to her, and when he perceived that his words drew forth slow and unwilling answers, he guessed that a secret sorrow rent her heart.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>"What happiness," she asked, "could reach a heart plunged in a sea of sorrow, and heaped with huge misfortunes?"

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>Then said the Prince--"Ah! dear lady, well do I believe that your grief is a heavy one, for only to hear you speak fills my soul with sadness; but let me entreat of you to unfold it, for counsel eases the worst sorrow."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>So the whole party went on together, until they reached a great castle. Here, said the dwarf, lay his luckless lord, and here the Prince must try his prowess. Whereupon the Prince alighted from his steed, and bidding Una remain where she was and watch the issue of the fight, took Timias, his squire, and strode up to the castle wall. He found the gates fast closed, and no one to keep guard or answer to his call. At this, the squire blew a small bugle, which hung by his side, adorned with twisted gold and gay tassels, and writ all over with the wonders of its virtue.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='109'>None ever heard its shrill call who did not tremble before it. There was no gate however strong, or lock however firm, that did not burst open at its summons. And now, as the squire blew the magic horn, the grim castle quaked, every door flew open, and the giant himself rushed forth with an angry stare on his cruel countenance, eager to learn who or what this might be that had dared his dreaded power. After him appeared <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tongue;head;monster' adjectives='many-headed;many;flaming;fiery' verbs='ride;appear' valence='5.265' arousal='4.685' dominance='5.364'>Duessa</entity>, riding a many-headed monster, with a fiery, flaming tongue in every one of its many heads.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='110'>At once the Prince began a furious attack on the monster. Thereupon the giant buckled to the fight, and lifting up his dreadful club, all armed with ragged knobs and gnarled knots, thought to have slain the Prince at a single blow. But he, wise and wary, leapt swiftly aside, and the great weapon fell so heavily, that it sank three yards deep into the ground, making the earth tremble. Now, Orgoglio could not easily uplift his club, and as he strove to drag it from the deep cleft, the Prince smote off his left arm, which fell to the ground, a senseless block, while streams of blood gushed from the wound. Dismayed by the pain, Orgoglio roared aloud, and Duessa hastened to draw up her many-headed charger to his aid. But the squire soon forced the horrid beast to retreat, and at this Duessa in her pride rebelled and urged the monster afresh; but in vain, for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='monster;duessa;beast;stroke;post;pride' adjectives='vain;mighty;horrid' verbs='urge;force;deal;rebel;retreat;stand' valence='4.74928571429' arousal='4.815' dominance='5.11357142857'>Timias</entity> dealt mighty strokes, and stood firmly to his post.</paragraph>

He had wings which he spread out like great sails, and when these smote the air, the clouds fled in terror before them, and the heavens stood still in astonishment. His tail was twisted in a hundred folds, and lay over his scaly back, and when he unfolded its coils and displayed its full length, it swept the land behind him for three furlongs. At its extremity were inserted two deadly stings, sharper than the sharpest steel. And still sharper and more cruel were his claws; so cruel and ravenous, that all they touched, and all they drew within their reach, suffered certain destruction.</paragraph>

Never before, although many a knight had fought with him, had the dragon felt such force in the arm of a foe, and yet the deadly thrusts glanced back from his well-armed breast, leaving him unhurt.</paragraph>

These came right into the face of the knight, and making their way through his armour, burned him so sorely that he could hardly endure its weight. Faint and weary, burned, and sore with his wounds, worn out with heat and toil, and the very arms he bore, death seemed to him much easier than life.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='181'>This boon was a looking-glass, so wonderfully made, and possessed of such strange properties, that its fame spread throughout the wide world. The glass was round, shaped like a ball, and hollow inside. He who looked into it, saw not himself, but saw there portrayed anything that was happening in any part of the world that might be of consequence to him. If a foe were working him secret ill, or a friend feigning false kindness, this glass revealed their deeds.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='182'>Now the King of Cambria had one only child. This was Britomart, his daughter and his heir. She was a noble damsel, tall and stately, with rich golden hair, which, when loosened from its silken bands, fell like a sunny shower, reaching down to her feet. And she was brave as she was beautiful: gentle towards the weak, and ready to help those in trouble; one who scorned to take advantage of the misfortunes of others. A fit daughter of a great king, from whom her father kept no secrets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='183'>It chanced that one day, as Britomart was wandering over the palace, she found herself in the small apartment where Ryence kept the mirror. Forgetful of its strange virtues, the princess looked into it, and was surprised that she did not see a reflection of herself. Then she remembered that Merlin"s gift was no ordinary looking-glass, and as she recalled its properties, she began to wonder what she might look for there that was of importance to herself. Standing lingering by the mirror, her thoughts fell on love, and she wondered--as maidens will--whom fortune would allot for her husband.</paragraph>

His countenance was a right manly one; a countenance to awe his foes, but to endear him to his friends.

His armour was massive, and seemed of some antique mould, as indeed it was, for in golden letters there was written on it these words--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='210'>"Nay," replied Merlin, "true is it that naught can shake the heavenly destiny, nevertheless men must use their own endeavour to work it out.

He dwells in the Faeryland, and yet he is neither born of a fairy nor in any way related to one, but was by them stolen from his cradle, and to this day he is ignorant that he belongs not to their race. But he is in truth a son of Gorlois, and a brother of Cador, the great Cornish king, whose deeds are renowned from east to west. And to thee, Britomart, is it given to bring Artegal back to his native soil. He shall return to help his country to withstand the foreign invasion which now threatens thy father"s territory. His great strength and his dreaded name shall render great assistance against the foe; and thy prowess shall be added unto his, and together ye shall wear arms and bear great command."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='213'>Now it chanced that only a few days previously a band of Cambrians who had gone out against the Saxons had returned with much prey, and among other booty had carried back a complete suit of the armour worn by Angela, the Saxon Queen.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='225'>Arrived at the tyrant"s stronghold, they dismounted, and went boldly to its entrance.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='226'>"Alas!" said Scudamour, "this is the worst cause of my distress, for the fire cannot be quenched by any wit or skill; what then is there left to me but ceaseless sorrowing.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='228'>Thereupon, resolved to trust her weapons to the utmost, Britomart threw her great shield before her face, and pointing her magic sword straight in front, moved onward; when lo! the dread flames parted on either side of her, and she passed through scatheless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='229'>When Scudamour saw that she had passed beyond the fire and was uninjured, he, too, tried to force a way. But he was full of proud passions, and commanded the flames to yield to him, and being foolish enough to threaten them, increased their mighty rage so that with imperious sway they sent him back scorched and burned. Impatience and disappointment raged in his bosom, and in a very madness of misery he again flung himself on the ground and beat his head and breast, and would take neither hope nor comfort.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='230'>Meantime Britomart pursued her way, and going through the first door, entered an outer chamber. It was full of precious stores, and was hung round with rich arras, into which was woven many a fair scene, portraying the feats of Cupid, the blind god. At the upper end of the chamber stood an altar, built of gems of great beauty, and on the altar was an image of massive gold with wings of divers colours, more varied and brilliant than the hues of the rainbow. This image represented Cupid with the fatal bow and arrows in his hand, and at his feet a wounded dragon. Underneath were written these words--"Unto the victor of the gods this be," and all the people that dwelt in the great castle paid it homage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='231'>Britomart stood still for a while, gazing at the golden image, fascinated by its brightness; but at length she turned to look back and take in the other wonders of the chamber. Then, for the first time, she noticed the words "Be bold" written over a doorway. She puzzled over their meaning for some time, and could not find it, but no way dismayed by the apparent warning, she followed their advice, and advanced from the first to a second chamber.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='232'>This chamber was still richer than the other. Its walls were overlaid with gold wrought with figures of antique story, and all about were the spoils and arms and trophies of mighty conquerors, who had been taken captive by the cruel Cupid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='233'>For a long time Britomart gazed around her, and the more she looked the more she wondered, both at the richness of the room and at the wasteful emptiness and solemn silence that pervaded the place. As she continued her survey, she saw over the door through which she had just passed the same words, three times written, "Be bold." While trying to make out their import, her eye chanced to light upon an iron door at the other end of the room, on which was written, "Be not too bold." This puzzled her still more; but no living creature appeared from whom she could ask an explanation. And now the shadows lengthened, and darkness fell, yet Britomart would not sleep, but sat in watchfulness, her armour on, and her weapons all about her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='234'>When night had quite set in, she was startled by the shrill sound of a trumpet. After the trumpet blast, there arose a hideous storm of wind, with thunder, lightning, and an earthquake, followed by a horrible stench of sulphur and smoke, which lasted from four in the morning until six--yet Britomart remained steadfast in her watch. Then suddenly arose a whirlwind throwing open the heavy iron door, and from an inner room there entered a grave personage bearing a branch of laurel, and clad as if for the tragic stage. Before Britomart had time to recover from the surprise of this apparition, a band of minstrels, followed by a troop of masquers, issued also from the chamber. Sweet music and strange and gay figures now filled the hitherto empty room. There were Fancy and Desire, dressed in silk and embroidery; Doubt and Danger in more sober garb; Fear, armed from head to foot; Hope, with golden locks and samite robes; Suspicion and Deceit, Grief and Fury, Pleasure and Displeasure--six couples in all. Behind these came a fair lady, led by Cruelty and Despight, who goaded and tormented her as she walked. After these rode the winged god, mounted on a lion, and closely followed by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='god;repentance;shame;lion;rabble;rear' adjectives='winged;confused' verbs='follow;ride;mount;bring' valence='5.082' arousal='4.46533333333' dominance='5.18666666667'>Reproach</entity>, Shame, and Repentance, while a confused rabble brought up the rear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='235'>The procession marched three times round the chamber, and disappeared into the inner room. As soon as it had passed through, the iron door was violently closed by the same whirlwind which had opened it. Then Britomart came forth from the shady corner in which she had stood unnoticed, and tried to follow; but she could by no means pass <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='corner;means;opportunity;britomart' adjectives='shady;unnoticed' verbs='be;oblige;arise;try;stand;have;pass;follow;come;wait' valence='5.36266666667' arousal='3.83466666667' dominance='5.478'>the door</entity>, and was obliged to wait patiently for any opportunity that might arise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='236'>All day the maiden waited, and when the next night came with its garment of darkness her hopes rose, and not in vain. About the second watch, the door flew open, and afraid neither of masques nor enchantments, Britomart walked boldly in. As soon as she entered, she looked round for those persons whom she had seen the previous night. But of all the motley crew only one was visible, and this was the fair lady who had been led by the cruel villains, and who indeed was Amoret. Her hands were fast bound, and round her waist was an iron band that fastened her to a brass pillar. Before her was the wicked enchanter, drawing strange characters with Amoret"s own heart"s blood, which he drew from her by means of a cruel transfixed dart. By such strange spells, he sought to charm her into loving him. But he had already tried a thousand charms, and had utterly failed to touch her love and loyalty to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='love;imprisonment;charm;loyalty' adjectives='such;little;cruel;likely' verbs='be;love;work;try;touch;have;fail' valence='5.79166666667' arousal='4.38611111111' dominance='5.60222222222'>Scudamour</entity>, and indeed she was little likely to love one who wrought such cruel imprisonment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='237'>The moment the enchanter saw Britomart in her knightly attire, he cast away his books of wicked magic, and drawing a murderous knife from his pocket ran fiercely at poor Amoret, whom for very spite he was ready to kill rather than see her escape. Britomart leapt forward, seized his arm, and stayed his murderous intent. In a moment the enchanter"s rage turned upon her, and his sword inflicted a wound upon her snowy throat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='238'>Then Britomart drew forth her deadly spear, and struck him so dire a blow, that he fell on the ground half dead.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='240'>Glad to secure his life on any terms, the enchanter at once yielded, and rising up, began to look over the leaves of his accursed books, that he might learn how to reverse the charms he had wrought. Britomart stood over him with her sword drawn, and so dreadful were the things he read, that her hair stood on end with horror. By and bye she perceived that the house shook and the door rattled, but not for a moment did she slacken the grasp of her weapon. With steadfast eye and stout courage she waited to see what these strange omens meant. At length she saw the chain that wound round the waist of Amoret fall slowly to the ground, and the brazen pillar to which she was bound break in pieces. The dart that pierced her bosom fell out as of its own accord. The wound it had made closed up as though it had never existed, and all the hurts and bruises caused by her long imprisonment were forthwith healed.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='251'>Now this Marinell was a sea-nymph"s son, and dwelt in a rocky cave by the sea-shore. His mother had trained him to deeds of daring and a life of hardihood. Along the strand on which he dwelt no man durst pass without first doing battle with Marinell. He had subdued and made vassals of a hundred brave knights, and his renown had reached the Court of Gloriana, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='vassal;knight;renown;court;gloriana' adjectives='' verbs='make;brave;reach;subdue;have' valence='5.5675' arousal='3.90916666667' dominance='5.56416666667'>Queen</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='vassal;knight;renown;court;gloriana' adjectives='' verbs='make;brave;reach;subdue;have' valence='5.5675' arousal='3.90916666667' dominance='5.56416666667'>Faeryland</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='252'>Yet Cymoent, his mother, was not satisfied, but prayed the sea-god to make her son richer than the son of any of the mortals. The sea-god granted her prayer, and bade the waves yield him their treasure--treasure gained by the wreck of many a gallant craft.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='253'>So there were heaped upon his shores great riches--gold, amber, ivory, pearls, jewels, rings, and all else that was precious, until Marinell became as great a lord as any that dwelt in the land. So powerful did he grow that his mother began to fear lest his boldness and haughtiness might cost him his life, and she counselled him to forbear further warfare and be at rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='254'>That she might be the more secure of his welfare, Cymoent inquired of Proteus, the sea-god, concerning her son"s future. Proteus replied that Marinell must beware of all womankind, as one day a strange maiden would cause him much dismay, if not destroy his life. Now Cymoent supposed this to mean that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cymoent;advice;woman;word;son' adjectives='' verbs='counsel;love;suppose;follow;mean;listen' valence='5.82272727273' arousal='3.94636363636' dominance='5.35727272727'>Marinell</entity> must not love any woman; she counselled her son accordingly, and he listened to her words and followed her advice.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='256'>This was no other than Britomart, journeying in disguise. Marinell rode fiercely up to her, and haughtily bade her retire before he made retreat impossible. She was filled with disdain at his proud threat, and replying, "Fly they that need to fly," thrust at him with her magic spear. Thereupon <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='blow;horse;neck;spear;shield;moment;s;hauberk;breast;head;side;thereupon' adjectives='bent;low' verbs='smite;pierce;raise;wound;strike;glance' valence='5.19842105263' arousal='4.37' dominance='5.01'>Marinell</entity> struck her on the breast; for a moment her head bent low upon her horse"s neck; then she raised herself and smote him so hard a blow that her spear pierced his shield and hauberk, and glancing off, wounded his side.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='257'>Thus Britomart bore him down until he fell helpless on the sand. She did not stay to lament his fall, but went on her way, passing by his treasure, and caring nothing for it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='259'>Now, the sad tidings of Marinell"s overthrow reached Cymoent as she and her sister-nymphs were disporting themselves by a pond gathering daffodils to make garlands wherewith to shade their foreheads from the sun. When Cymoent heard the melancholy news, she flung away her flowers, and rending her hair, threw herself speechless on the ground. The nymphs likewise tore off their garlands, and loudly lamented <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nymph;s;fate;garland' adjectives='' verbs='tear;lament' valence='4.62' arousal='4.73' dominance='4.836'>Marinell</entity>"s fate.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='260'>At length Cymoent arose out of her swoon. She at once called for her chariot, while the sea-nymphs called for theirs, and set out with her on their mournful errand. The waves ceased to rage, and helped them on their way, while the dolphins which drew the chariots sped swiftly through the water, and brought Cymoent and her sisters to where <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sister;chariot;rage;cymoent;dolphin;wave;water;way' adjectives='' verbs='draw;help;bring;cease;lay;speed' valence='5.93538461538' arousal='4.20846153846' dominance='5.80769230769'>Marinell</entity> lay.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='261'>They found him in a deadly faint. When his mother saw him lying thus, she fell from one swoon into another, and when she at length recovered, made such piteous moanings that the very rocks could scarce refrain from tears. She bewailed her son"s fall, and wished that she too had been mortal to have shared his fate.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='262'>At length, after long sorrowing and great wailing, the sea-nymphs took Marinell"s armour off, spread their silver-fringed garments on the strand, and laid him upon them. They then examined his wound, washed the blood away, and poured in balm and nectar. Then Liagore, the lily-handed, trained by Apollo in the surgeon"s lore, felt his pulse, and discovered that life still lingered in his frame. Whereupon his mother no longer despaired, but, aided by the sea-nymphs, bore him to her chariot. At her command the dolphin-team remained still while flowers were strewn over him as if he were already dead. The sister-nymphs then climbed into their chariots, and Marinell was borne swiftly to Cymoent"s sea cave. It was far down at the bottom of the sea, and built up of hollow billows heaped high on all sides. Here, on the softest of couches, they laid him, while Cymoent sent for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='art;cymoent;nymph;couch;healing;sea-god;plight' adjectives='sad;round;best;softest' verbs='bemoan;sit;lay;send;esteem' valence='5.70454545455' arousal='3.79545454545' dominance='5.47272727273'>Tryphon</entity>, the best esteemed among the sea-gods in the art of healing, and the nymphs sat round bemoaning his sad plight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='263'>Now, the news of Marinell"s sad overthrow reached the court of Gloriana, Queen of Faeryland, where was the lady Florimell, who was famed for her rare goodness and great beauty, and was held in high repute throughout all Elfin-land. She was loved of many knights, but she herself loved only Marinell, and when the news of his fall reached her, Florimell resolved to leave the court of Gloriana, and vowed that she would not return until she had found her love, alive or dead. She mounted a snow-white palfrey, and attended by a trusty dwarf, set forth: she was clad in a dress of cloth of gold, and her fair locks were bound in a jewelled circlet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='264'>Some days after, it happened that Prince Arthur, accompanied by Timias, his squire, and one or two others whom they had encountered on their way, were riding leisurely through the woods that led to Marinell"s abode, when the fair Florimell dashed suddenly across their path. She had burst out from the brushwood, and rode as if for her life. Her hair streamed behind her, and she constantly looked back as if fearing pursuit. And sure enough, there appeared a rough forester, riding a jaded steed, which he was urging over <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='steed;side;bank;forester;blood' adjectives='rough;sure;jaded' verbs='be;ride;flow;appear;urge' valence='5.14142857143' arousal='4.23071428571' dominance='5.20928571429'>bush</entity> and bank until the blood flowed from its sides.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='265'>Now, when the Prince saw this, he and a knight named Guyon hastened to Florimell"s rescue, while Timias, the Prince"s squire, followed the forester. Through thick and thin, over hill and plain, the Prince and the knight followed, but the poor damsel feared them as much as she feared the forester, and fled from them so swiftly, that when they reached a double way she was out of sight, and they could not tell which path to take. Each took a separate one, and that chosen by the Prince proved right. At length he came in sight of Florimell. Urging afresh his foaming steed, he approached the terrified damsel, and called on her to have no fear. She looked back, but, not recognizing Prince Arthur"s arms or shield, paid no attention to his call. And so it fell that darkness came on, and the Prince was reluctantly obliged to give up all hope of helping her. Little did she think from how great and good a deliverer she fled, or into what miseries this flight would lead her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='266'>Thus Florimell sped on, fearing every shadow and every sound, until when darkness fell, she grew so weary that her palfrey wrested the reins from her slack hold, and went where he would. At length even he could go no farther, and to her dismay, lay down. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;force;lead;alight' valence='5.395' arousal='4.1475' dominance='5.205'>Florimell</entity> was now forced to alight and lead him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='267'>After travelling slowly for some time, she came to a hill-side, and here she saw below her a little valley thickly clothed with wood. From amongst its high trees there arose a wreath of thin blue smoke, and encouraged by this sign of habitation, the maiden went on her way more hopefully. But she was very weary and worn when she reached the place from which the smoke proceeded. It was a cottage built of sticks and reeds, walled round with sods, where dwelt a witch, dressed in poor and dirty rags, and living wilfully in want. She dwelt in these dark woods because her deeds were evil.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='268'>Here poor Florimell entered, and found the hag seated on the ground, apparently busied in magic arts; she started up when she saw Florimell, stared at her, but said nothing. Very soon her fear, for such it seemed, turned to anger, and she asked the damsel who she was, and what ill fortune had sent her there, unwelcome and uninvited.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='269'>Florimell replied that she had lost her way, and prayed her not to be angry with one who was unwilling to intrude on her, and only begged shelter and rest for a little space. As she spoke, tears dropped from her eyes, and she sighed so gently and sadly that the wicked old woman could not help being sorry for her, and began in her rude way to show some kindly feeling; wiping the tears from Florimell"s eyes, she bade her sit down and rest. Florimell gladly obeyed; she sat down on the dusty ground, put her torn garments into better order, smoothed her fair hair, and fastened it into its golden circlet. When the hag saw the rich ornaments in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='goddess;ornament;hag;hair;s;way' adjectives='beautiful;rich' verbs='be;find;see;have;behold;fear;wonder' valence='5.64411764706' arousal='4.32235294118' dominance='5.49705882353'>Florimell</entity>"s hair, and beheld how beautiful she was, she wondered greatly, and feared lest a goddess had found her way to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='goddess;ornament;hag;hair;s;way' adjectives='beautiful;rich' verbs='be;find;see;have;behold;fear;wonder' valence='5.64411764706' arousal='4.32235294118' dominance='5.49705882353'>the hut</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='270'>This old witch had a son who was as wicked as herself. He was also lazy and good-for-nothing, loving to lounge in the sunshine, and sleep away his time. When he returned home, and found a fair lady sitting by his mother, he was so astonished at the sight of beauty in such a place, that he stood quite still, staring at Florimell, and saying never a word. At length he went up to his mother, and asked her in a whisper by what strange chance this vision had appeared. His mother only replied by a scared look, as if her wits were gone, and the two gazed first at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wit;look;mother' adjectives='scared' verbs='go;reply;gaze;be' valence='6.0875' arousal='4.25666666667' dominance='5.6925'>Florimell</entity>, and then at one another.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='271'>By-and-bye, however, they grew accustomed to her presence. Her ways were so gentle that the witch"s son became enamoured of her beauty, and brought her young birds and garlands of flowers, and a wild squirrel which he tamed. Florimell received his gifts courteously, but she feared him, and so, when an opportunity came, she saddled and bridled her palfrey, and early one morning made her escape. She went in great trepidation, for she was afraid that she might be followed and overtaken.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='272'>Now when the witch and her son awoke and found her gone, their grief was very great. Indeed, the son became almost frantic, and nothing his mother could do would pacify him. So she bethought herself of her wicked arts, and retiring to her secret cave, called up a hideous beast, monstrous and misshapen;--its back speckled with a thousand spots, and so swift that it could overtake the fleetest steed. Nothing like it had ever been seen, yet it more resembled a hyena than any other creature.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='273'>This monster the hag sent after Florimell, charging it not to pause until it found her, and either to bring her back or slay and devour her. The moment she ceased speaking, it set off, and by the help of its keen sense, surely and swiftly traced the maiden. When Florimell saw the cruel monster, and perceived that it began to overtake her, her heart quaked with fear. Terror also seized her palfrey, who, as long as breath supplied him with strength, fled onwards. At length his pace began to slacken fatally, and then indeed, Florimell believed herself at the last extremity. But just as her horse"s strength gave way, she reached the shore, and slipping hastily to the ground, sped towards the water, thinking to drown herself rather than have the monster seize her. All unexpectedly she found a little boat, with an old fisherman asleep in it, drawn up at the water"s edge. Leaping into the boat, she seized an oar, and pushed it out from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='oar;boat' adjectives='' verbs='push;leap;seize' valence='5.3' arousal='3.89714285714' dominance='5.35428571429'>the land</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='274'>Her escape was none too soon, for the monster was close upon her, and ready to spring just as her boat left the shore. It gaped greedily at her, but durst not venture into the water, and turning back avenged its wicked spite upon the noble palfrey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='275'>By-and-bye the good Sir Satyrane, who had delivered Una from the Satyrs, rode that way, and seeing the dead body of the horse, recognized it as belonging to Florimell. He feared some ill must have befallen the maiden, and his fears were confirmed when he found a golden girdle she was wont to wear lying on the sand. Full of grief and rage, he fell upon the speckled beast, and wounded it severely; but it managed to escape from him, and returned to the old hag, while Sir Satyrane was forced to go on his way. When the old woman saw the beast return, she believed that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;woman;return;image;son;beast;mother;likeness;spirit' adjectives='such;wretched;old;dead;wicked' verbs='be;rejoice;give;make;comfort;see;call;become;believe;mistake' valence='5.68103448276' arousal='4.23275862069' dominance='5.45103448276'>Florimell</entity> was dead, and rejoiced in her heart, but her son became more wretched than ever, and to comfort him, his mother made an image, and calling a wicked spirit into it, gave it such a likeness to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;woman;return;image;son;beast;mother;likeness;spirit' adjectives='such;wretched;old;dead;wicked' verbs='be;rejoice;give;make;comfort;see;call;become;believe;mistake' valence='5.68103448276' arousal='4.23275862069' dominance='5.45103448276'>Florimell</entity> that her son mistook it for her, and was comforted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='276'>Meanwhile the true Florimell was in fresh straits. For a long time the fisherman slept on, so that she had to steer the boat as best she could, but this was an easy task, for the wind was light and the sky clear. But when the old man awoke, she discovered that he was rude and cruel, and would have made a slave of her if he could. It chanced, however, that Proteus, god of the seas, was abroad that day, and was roving over the foamy waves, drawn by his finny steeds. He came upon the little boat, and when he saw that the fisherman behaved roughly to the damsel, he beat the old man and took <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='damsel;chariot;fisherman;boat;man' adjectives='little;own;old' verbs='beat;see;behave;come;take' valence='5.28333333333' arousal='4.2675' dominance='5.405'>Florimell</entity> into his own chariot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='277'>Meantime Marinell still lingered in his mother"s bower. By the aid of Tryphon, the sea-god"s surgeon, he had been cured of the wound inflicted by Britomart. But so fearful was his mother lest further ill should befall her son, that sorely against his will she kept him in her cave almost as closely confined as if he had been a prisoner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='278'>It happened at this time that all the sea-gods met to celebrate the wedding of the Thames and the Medway. A solemn feast in honour of the event was held at the abode of Proteus, and there Cymoent, with many others, was summoned. With her went Marinell, but, as his father was only a mortal, Marinell was not accounted a god, and might not banquet with immortals or eat of their food. Therefore, while his mother was within, he wandered about examining the strange abode, and, as he did so, there befel to him a strange adventure. From under a hideous overhanging cliff he heard a sad voice uttering such piteous lamentations that the cruel rocks and raging billows seemed moved in sympathy. It was Florimell, who, believing herself alone, bewailed her fate aloud. Though none could hear, she nevertheless spoke out her grief in the hope that the very recital might yield her some comfort, for</paragraph>

Then she prayed all the sea-gods to release her, or else to let her die at once, and ended by the words, "Know, Marinell, that all this is for thee." After this followed such an outburst of grief and weeping that it seemed as if poor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grief;heart;s;outburst' adjectives='poor' verbs='break;follow;seem;weep' valence='4.61818181818' arousal='4.62090909091' dominance='4.54636363636'>Florimell</entity>"s heart must break.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='287'>In his sorrow began the dawning of his love, and he set himself to devise the fair damsel"s escape. He thought of suing Proteus for her release, but this he could not do without his mother"s aid, and he remembered her charge against the love of women. For a moment he contemplated rescuing her by force of arms, but Proteus was a god, while he had only mortal"s might. Then he bethought himself of carrying her off by stealth, but the damsel was surrounded by water, and he possessed no means of getting her to land. So he wandered sadly about the rock, blaming himself severely for not having acknowledged her goodness and beauty long ago.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='288'>At length the feast was over, and Marinell was obliged to accompany his mother home, and, sore against his will, leave Florimell in her sea-walled dungeon. Thinking of nothing but her sad fate, he was silent and disinclined for companionship, and so brooded over his secret sorrow that he could neither eat nor sleep. He pined and languished and wept until he grew so weak and ill that he could not stand upright, but was forced to lie upon his couch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='289'>When his mother saw his miserable state, she was greatly troubled, and knew not what to think, for she could not discover the source of his malady. She fancied his old wound was the cause, and repaired to Tryphon, whom she chid sharply because of her son"s distress. He returned with her and examined the wound, but said that Marinell"s present discomfiture must have some other source, perhaps an unknown grief. At this Cymoent was more troubled than before, and went to her son, beseeching him to reveal to her what lay hidden in his heart, but he would not. Then forsaking the sea-gods as of no avail, she hastened to the heavens, and thence brought Apollo, god of healing, to see her son. He declared the disease to be love.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='290'>Cymoent grieved and fretted greatly when she heard this, and went to her son and prayed him in gentle words to tell her which one of the sea-nymphs he loved. She felt sure it must be a sea-nymph, and was the less concerned since the god"s warning had been only against a mortal maid. She therefore promised, whoever it might be, to aid him in his suit. Great was her dismay when Marinell replied that he loved Florimell. But it was no time to indulge in fruitless grief, for her son lay in danger of his life. Cymoent therefore went straight to Neptune, and telling him of Proteus" cruelty towards Florimell, begged him to order her release. This Neptune at once did, and armed with his warrant she went to Proteus" cave, and there saw the maiden whom her son loved. The old sea-god read his monarch"s mandate in moody silence, but was forced to obey, and therefore yielded his prisoner to Cymoent. She, charmed by Florimell"s grace and gentle loveliness, took her by the hand, and welcomed her lovingly, rejoicing that her son should have so fair a wife. Then Cymoent showed her son the fair maiden, and his heart and spirit were so cheered within him that his strength gradually returned, and he became himself again.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>At length a shrill horn echoed through the wood, and some one was heard moving quickly in the thicket. This new cause of fright so overcame Braggadochio that he tumbled hastily from his horse and crept into a bush. Trompart waited to see what would happen. Presently there issued from the brushwood a lady in hunting dress. She was very beautiful: her habit was adorned with rich jewels, and her stately bearing showed her to be of princely birth. In her hand she carried a boar-spear, and at her back was slung a bow and a quiver full of steel headed darts.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='312'>As he spoke Braggadochio crept forth on hands and knees; then, rising up boldly, shook his helmet fiercely, trying to appear as if he had just been awakened from deep slumber. The sight of her beauty restored him to self-confidence, and he was beginning to resume airs of vanity when a vision of the weapons she carried cowed him. Her manner, however, again reassured him. She addressed him as a companion-in-arms, and Braggadochio, taking up the strain, recounted the wondrous deeds he had done, then boldly asked who she was that thus ranged the forest and did not dwell at court. To this she replied, that honour was only truly to be found in toil, and that he who idled at home need not hope to win it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='313'>While she spoke Braggadochio, presuming on her graciousness, grew more and more insolent in his demeanour.

So, concluding that he had better depart lest worse things should befall, he mounted his steed and rode away in so clumsy and untrained a manner that the noble animal chafed under him, and yearned to be eased of his burden.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='314'>Some time after this, as Braggadochio and Trompart, who now also possessed a steed, were going on their way, they saw a rude rustic seated on the roadside by a beautiful lady, richly decked with jewels. Now, these were no other than the false Florimell and her lover, son of the old witch who had sent the cruel beast after Florimell the true. Braggadochio thought a knight such as himself more suited to the fair lady than any rustic. He therefore couched his spear, rode up to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pain;death;damsel;spear' adjectives='' verbs='be;ride;declare;yield;couch' valence='5.0575' arousal='4.4175' dominance='5.02833333333'>the man</entity>, declaring that the damsel was his, and must be yielded to him on pain of death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='315'>The rustic, greatly alarmed, and not daring to fight against so powerful-looking an enemy, let his lady go, and Braggadochio mounted her on Trompart"s horse and led her off, a proud and happy man.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='316'>The appearance of this knight greatly disconcerted Braggadochio, but he looked as fierce as he could, and made a show of cheering his lady, who also was afraid. The knight came on, fierce and powerful, and bade Braggadochio give up the lady or else do battle for her. This challenge made the boaster quake with terror, but he put on the best appearance of bravery he could, and addressing the stranger declared that man to be very foolish who sought to win with words what he had gained with blows. At this <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='angry' verbs='fight;grow;prepare;tell' valence='4.588' arousal='4.628' dominance='5.298'>the knight</entity> grew angry, and told <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='angry' verbs='fight;grow;prepare;tell' valence='4.588' arousal='4.628' dominance='5.298'>Braggadochio</entity> to prepare to fight.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='325'>And here fortune favoured Braggadochio, for there arose a great quarrel as to whose Florimell should be.

At length Sir Satyrane proposed that all should forego their claim, and that the false Florimell should be placed in their midst, and of her own free will choose her rightful lord. To this the knights agreed, and after looking long at each one, as if she would fain have pleased them all, Florimell turned to Braggadochio. The knights were almost mad with disappointment and anger at her choice, so Braggadochio, feeling rather uncomfortable and not very safe among them, bore her off in the night, and left them to complain.</paragraph>

This day was to end the tournament, and as the fight grew more and more fierce, Marinell became surrounded, and was in serious danger. At that moment the brave Sir Artegal, whom Britomart sought, entered the tilting-yard, and at the same time, Braggadochio, Trompart, and the lady. Sir Artegal saw Marinell"s danger, and hastened to his aid, but not wishing to be recognized, he changed shields with Braggadochio before entering the lists. After a hard combat, he succeeded in rescuing <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='knight;combat;honour' adjectives='hard' verbs='win;succeed;oppose;rescue' valence='5.3675' arousal='5.125' dominance='5.48375'>Marinell</entity> from the opposing knights, and together they won every honour of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='knight;combat;honour' adjectives='hard' verbs='win;succeed;oppose;rescue' valence='5.3675' arousal='5.125' dominance='5.48375'>the field</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='328'>The tournament ended, Sir Artegal returned his shield to Braggadochio, and the whole company repaired to the great hall, where the judges of the tilting match were to announce the name of him who had won the prize. There also stood the true Florimell, ready to greet every knight according to the deeds he had done. Then the judges called for the stranger knight who had rescued Marinell, but Artegal did not move, and in his stead Braggadochio advanced and showed his shield, which all recognized as that belonging to the victor. The trumpets sounded three times in his honour, the judges awarded him the prize, and Florimell came forth to greet him and to thank him for the honour he had done her name.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='329'>At these rude words, Florimell turned aside, and Braggadochio, who had kept his lady veiled until now, brought her boldly forth before all the people, maintaining that she and not the other was Florimell the true. She was indeed fair, and for a moment the assemblage was stupified, and agreed that if this were not the Florimell famed throughout Faeryland, she was yet more beautiful. Even Marinell was dismayed, and knew not what to believe. Then arose Sir Artegal, and no longer able to contain his anger against Braggadochio, plainly discovered himself, and charging the boaster with utter falsehood, declared it was he and not Braggadochio who had rescued Marinell; for proof of which he pointed to the false knight"s unused sword. He next called for Florimell, and leading her up to the other, caused the two to stand side by side. Behold, the false could not abide the presence of the true, and the false Florimell faded away before their eyes, and no trace of her was left but the empty girdle. The people were struck dumb with astonishment, and Braggadochio was seized with despair and remained as still as if he were lifeless. Artegal broke the silence, for he stooped and lifted the girdle, and presented it to Florimell. She fastened it on her waist, and it fitted perfectly; and all were convinced that this was indeed <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='joy;token;waist' adjectives='' verbs='be;fit;crowd;give;convince;fasten' valence='5.981' arousal='4.076' dominance='5.821'>Florimell</entity>, and crowded around her, giving her tokens of their joy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='330'>Meantime, a commotion arose in the hall. The knight Guyon, to whom the stolen horse belonged, had arrived, and seeing Braggadochio"s horse recognized it as his own. Seizing its reins with one hand and drawing his sword with the other, he insisted on having it restored. Braggadochio refused, and a quarrel ensued, which bade fair to be a bloody one. Then Artegal came forward and asked Guyon whether he could prove the steed to be his own. Guyon replied that there was a mark inside the horse"s mouth by which he could certainly recognize it. At this several of those present tried to open its mouth, and were severely bitten for their pains.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='337'>It was the last day of the tournament when they arrived. Many brave combats had already taken place, but for this day was reserved the most eager display of valour. Full many a knightly deed was wrought, and when fortune seemed to forsake the side of Satyrane, he himself was ever ready to assist his knights and uphold their honour, proving once again his far-famed prowess. Nor was there one that day who did not put forth his utmost strength, as might be well seen from the many wounds received, the shivered spears and broken swords, and horses that ran riderless. Still the knights of Sir Satyrane kept the ascendency. But when the day had dragged on a weary pace, there appeared from out the other side a stranger. Whence he came no man could say, nor could they discover aught from the arms which he bore. His steed was caparisoned with oaken leaves, his armour looked like wild weeds decked with wood mosses, and on his ragged shield was the strange device, "Salvagesse sans finesse." On entering the lists this new-comer levelled his spear at the first knight he met, and overthrew him at the first encounter. Knight after knight he vanquished, until his spear split, and then he drew his sword, and with it hewed and slashed at helmets until everyone began to shun the very sight of him as of death itself. And now all men wondered who this was, and whence he came, inquiring one of another by what name he was called, and when they could learn nothing they dubbed him the Savage Knight because of his wild appearance. He was, however, no knight of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='knight' adjectives='' verbs='be;brave' valence='6.4575' arousal='4.3275' dominance='6.39'>the woods</entity>, but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='knight' adjectives='' verbs='be;brave' valence='6.4575' arousal='4.3275' dominance='6.39'>Artegal</entity>, the brave and mighty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='338'>Thus were Sir Satyrane and his knights dismayed by the sole power of Artegal, and none of them durst stand in the field before him, but were beaten back and chased about all the day, until evening came, and the sun began to slant downwards in the heavens. Then, again, there rushed out from the thickest press, an unknown knight, who in turn put to shame even the glory of Sir Artegal.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='339'>This was Britomart, who, eager to restore the day to Sir Satyrane, bent her powerful spear towards Artegal"s helmet, and smote him so sore a blow that he fell from his charger, and was for a time unable to arise.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='348'>So together they plotted vengeance on the unconscious and noble Britomart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='349'>While they were thus talking, they saw far off, a knight, dressed in foreign arms and strange accoutrements, whom on nearer approach, they recognized as none other than this same Knight of the Heben Spear. Then Scudamour prayed Sir Artegal to let him make the first attack. Artegal granted the request, and Scudamour, preparing his spear for battle, ran fiercely against his foe. Britomart, seeing his intention, prepared to receive the onset, and so entertained <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;onset;intention;britomart;rider;ground' adjectives='' verbs='receive;be;see;entertain;prepare' valence='5.83545454545' arousal='4.04727272727' dominance='5.94272727273'>Sir Scudamour</entity>, that presently both horse and rider were on the ground.</paragraph>

He leapt lightly up, and snatching his deadly blade, sprang upon Britomart, assailing her with such vigour that although she was mounted and he on foot, she was forced to give way before him. Now, as they fought, it happened that Britomart wheeled suddenly round, when Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='blow;sir;steed;s;dismount;sword;crest' adjectives='round' verbs='wheel;force;wound;fight;fall;strike;happen' valence='4.79733333333' arousal='4.51733333333' dominance='4.96'>Artegal</entity>"s sword struck a blow behind her crest, which falling backward, wounded her steed, and forced her to dismount.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='351'>Not a whit dismayed, she cast from her the enchanted spear, and betook herself to her shield and sword.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='352'>But now the tide of battle began to change, for Britomart grew weary, while Artegal, through very fighting, seemed to gain rather than to lose strength. He showered blow after blow on his opponent as if he would tear her body from her soul, and then gathering together all his force, the Savage Knight upraised his arm to deal a stroke from which it seemed impossible that Britomart could escape with her life. Down came the cruel blow, and falling on her helmet, struck off the face-piece, then glancing aside, did no further hurt.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='353'>And now appeared the maiden"s beauteous countenance, shining like the ruddy morn; and all around, her fair hair--loosened from its band by the stir of the fight--fell like a golden shower glistening as the shining sand. And as Sir Artegal once more raised his sword, thinking to deal the last deadly blow, his arm was suddenly arrested; and benumbed with secret fear, shrank from its revengeful purpose, while the cruel sword fell from his slackened fingers to the ground. Then Artegal, having gazed long on the fair and unexpected vision, fell humbly on his knee, thinking that she who stood before him was a heavenly goddess, and horror-struck with what he had done, prayed for pardon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='354'>But Britomart, full of wrath because of the stroke that had revealed her face, still held her arm uplifted, and standing sternly over the knight, threatened to strike unless he would return to the combat, bidding him arise or he should surely die.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='355'>When Britomart beheld the face of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beauty;house;britomart;father;face;arm;s;courage;way;mirror;spirit;side' adjectives='magic;angry;manly;haughty;upraised' verbs='be;subdue;give;see;countenance;have;fall;become;behold' valence='5.826' arousal='4.2336' dominance='5.6076'>Artegal</entity> in all its manly beauty, she saw that it was the countenance she had beheld in the magic mirror in her father"s house; her angry courage gave way, her haughty spirit became subdued, and her upraised arm fell quietly by her side.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='356'>But the maiden was very proud, and cared not to show that she was conquered, so by-and-bye she tried to uplift her hand again, as if rage and revenge still remained in her soul, but it fell harmless, for she caught sight of Sir Artegal"s fair countenance. Then she tried to force bitter, angry words from her tongue, but it too refused to obey her will, and instead of wrathful speeches, would utter only mild and gentle words.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='357'>And Scudamour, relieved from all his jealous fears by the vision of her loveliness, grew sportive in his speech, rallying Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;loveliness;behaviour;speech;scudamour;fear;vision;opponent' adjectives='jealous;sportive;sudden;late;humble' verbs='rally;relieve;grow' valence='5.26416666667' arousal='4.61666666667' dominance='5.44416666667'>Artegal</entity> on his so sudden humble behaviour towards his late opponent.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='359'>When Britomart heard the name of Artegal, she knew in very truth that this was the knight whom Merlin had told her she should wed. Her heart gave a great leap. She trembled for sudden joy and secret fear, while the blood rushed through her veins and mounted to her fair face. Then, fearful of betraying herself, she strove the harder to continue in her former angry mood, trying thus to hide her newly-awakened feeling.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='360'>"Ye gentle knights," she said, "whom fortune hath brought to be spectators of the emotion which secret fate hath wrought in this fair lady, marvel not, and henceforth be not the prey of idle fears and jealous thoughts. Nor may you, Sir Artegal, again disdain the might of woman"s arm, which hath twice conquered you, nor any longer be rebellious unto love, which is the crown of knighthood and the bond of noble minds. And you, fair lady knight," continued the old woman, "relent, and grant him your grace."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='361'>Britomart blushed deeply at her nurse"s words, but Artegal rejoiced in his inmost heart, yet dared not make too sudden a change in his demeanour, nor show openly the love which her beauty and quiet dignity of manner, so grave and full of princeliness, inspired within him. But his passion grew the stronger from the very restraint imposed upon him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='362'>Here Scudamour, whose heart had all this time been racked with fear and hope, interposed, with a request for tidings of Amoret. This Britomart at once granted, and went on to relate a sad tale: how, after freeing her from the enchanter, and guarding her with tender care and love for many a day, she had lost her in a wild desert, where from sheer weariness Britomart had fallen asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='363'>Poor Scudamour was terribly cast down by these melancholy tidings, and only plucked up a faint hope when Britomart pledged herself to remain with him until together they found the missing dame.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='364'>Meantime the three combatants being thus reconciled one to another, mounted their steeds, and rode towards a certain resting-place known to Sir Artegal, where they were well received and cared for. Here they remained until their wounds were healed, and their weary limbs thoroughly rested.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>And all the time they sojourned there, Sir Artegal served Britomart with meek service, watching continually how he might best please her. Thus day by day he made progress in his suit; and though Britomart in her womanly pride tried hard to conceal the love she bore him she could not quite succeed. So well did Artegal woo, so skilfully did he contrive, that at length he brought the noble damsel to bay and forced her to lay aside her seeming indifference and to hearken to his words. And as she listened to the vows with which he swore to love and guard her, Britomart"s reserve gave way, and she yielded a glad consent to love and own him for her lord until marriage should unite them for ever.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>But their marriage might not be yet, for Sir Artegal had been sent out from the court of Gloriana, Queen of Faeryland, on a hard adventure, and until it was achieved he might not turn aside from following after it. And now that his limbs were rested and his wounds were healed, the knight knew the time was come when he must leave Britomart and continue on his way, so he told her of the adventure on which he was bound. She, poor maiden, having just begun to taste of the rest and comfort of his presence, was sorely grieved and exceeding loth to be so soon parted from her "dearest love." But he, strong in the sense of duty, persuaded her to acquiesce, and with fresh vows of love and constancy, promised to return to her so soon as ever his enterprise was ended, which would not, he thought, be longer than three months.</paragraph>

At that moment Belphoebe returned, and when she saw her faithful squire so tender towards the lady, her heart swelled with proud disdain. In her sudden passion she was ready to have killed both squire and lady with the very bow which had already slain the monster. She however restrained herself, and drawing near to Timias, exclaimed, "Is this the faith?" then turned and fled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='402'>Distressed at her rebuke Timias instantly arose and followed her, but ever as he drew near she threatened him with her bow and would not permit him to approach her. After a long and fruitless pursuit the squire was forced to turn back with a sad heart. Finding a solitary part of the forest he chose a glade made gloomy with mossy trees, and there built a hut to live in. He broke his weapons and threw them away, vowing never again to fight nor ever again speak to a woman, but to live alone and deplore his grief. The better to keep his foolish vow he cut and spoiled his clothes, let his hair grow until it fell untended over his shoulders, ate only wild fruits and drank only running water. Thus he weakened himself until he was unfit to carry arms, and disguised himself until no one could recognize him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='403'>Indeed it chanced that one day Prince Arthur came into that part of the forest and found Timias in this wretched plight. The Prince talked to him and tried to make out who he was, but never guessed he was all the time addressing his lost squire.

Rising hastily she attempted to grasp it, but the dove flew out of her reach, and when she saw that Belphoebe followed, lingered until the maid was near, when she again flew a little way forward, and thus flying and resting lured her far into the forest. They at length arrived near to the abode of Timias, when the dove flew straight into his hand. There she began a most piteous plaint, as if to force Belphoebe to understand who this was. The maiden, however, although sorry for this wretched-looking man, and wishful to do him any good she could did not recognize him. But Timias knew her: he said nothing, but fell humbly at her feet, and kissing the ground on which she trod, washed it with his tears and looked at her with wistful looks. She did not understand him, but wondered at his courtly manners, and pitying his misery, asked him whether heaven or the cruelty of man or his own wilfulness were its cause.

Now, while Sir Calidore looked at the fair damsel and noted the difference in her mien from that of her companions, his heart, all unawares, became drawn towards her, and he stood gazing on her, quite forgetful of his quest, and that the Beast was all this time getting farther and farther away from him. And after the repast was quite over, he still stayed talking to the shepherds, hoping all the time that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shepherd;adventure;repast;time' adjectives='' verbs='be;overhear;stay;talk;recount;hope' valence='5.988' arousal='4.024' dominance='5.724'>Pastorella</entity> would overhear the adventures he recounted.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='435'>One day, as Sir Calidore, Coridon, and Pastorella were gathering strawberries in a green wood, a tiger rushed suddenly out of the forest, and with cruel jaws and wide open mouth ran straight at Pastorella. It happened that the others had wandered a little way from her, and the poor damsel, left defenceless, cried out for help. Coridon came running to her aid, but seeing the fierce beast, fled in terror, for his own life was dearer to him than hers. But when Sir Calidore came up and saw the tiger ready to tear Pastorella"s limbs, rage, not fear, filled his soul, and with no weapon but his shepherd"s hook, he ran at the wild beast and stunned it by his blow, and before it had time to recover he had struck off its head, which he laid at the feet of the trembling Pastorella. From that time she showed marked preference for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bride;preference;time' adjectives='little;marked' verbs='be;promise;show' valence='6.025' arousal='4.09625' dominance='5.71125'>Calidore</entity>, and a little after promised to be his bride.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='436'>Here they brought their captives, meaning to sell them to the first merchants who passed that way. But they had not been long in the island before the captain of the brigands fell in love with Pastorella and wished her for his wife. Now Pastorella, being betrothed to Calidore, could not listen to his wish, and this made him angry, and yet he loved her so much that he continued to try hard to gain her affection. All this made her so unhappy that she became ill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>When the brigands found that their captain was gone, the fighting ceased, and the combatants became as eager to make friends as they were before to quarrel; so having agreed among themselves, they lighted candles and began the melancholy search for the dead. Their captain they found cruelly slain, and by him the dying maid. Seeing that there was still life in Pastorella, they used every means to restore her, and at length succeeded. But when she was able to look round, and saw her father and her friends lying dead, wringing her hands, she wept and wailed and wished herself of their number. However, as the brigands were very anxious that she should get well, they took care of her in their rude way. When they went out to plunder, they left one of themselves--the best, although all were bad--in charge of her, but he was of little use, scarce giving her food or rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='438'>Meantime Sir Calidore had returned from the chase and had found the desolation caused by the brigands. He was almost mad with grief and rage, and his anguish was increased by the sad fact that there was no one to whom he could speak, nor any of whom he could ask tidings. He sought everywhere, but in vain; the woods and the plain were alike silent and empty. Roaming about restlessly in his despair, he at length saw someone coming towards him. The new-comer was dressed in rags, his hair was standing on end, and he was running as if from great danger. As he came near, Sir Calidore saw that it was Coridon. Hastening up to him <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='other' adjectives='' verbs='ask;be;hasten;take;have' valence='5.52' arousal='3.715' dominance='5.61166666667'>the knight</entity> asked where <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='other' adjectives='' verbs='ask;be;hasten;take;have' valence='5.52' arousal='3.715' dominance='5.61166666667'>Pastorella</entity> and the others had been taken.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='440'>On hearing these tidings, Sir Calidore"s heart well-nigh broke; but after a time he recovered spirit and determined to rescue Pastorella were she still alive, or to avenge her, were she dead.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='441'>As they neared the Island they came to a hill, on which they saw shepherds with their flocks. They determined to go and learn from them the latest tidings. Great was their surprise when Coridon recognized the flocks as the very ones that had been stolen from them, and these shepherds no other than the thieves. This discovery alarmed him greatly, and his heart began to lose all courage, but Sir Calidore reassured him as best he could and prevailed upon him to advance upon the men, who were all asleep. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;plan' adjectives='' verbs='prevent;have;slay' valence='5.32428571429' arousal='4.01714285714' dominance='5.76714285714'>Coridon</entity> would have slain them, but Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;plan' adjectives='' verbs='prevent;have;slay' valence='5.32428571429' arousal='4.01714285714' dominance='5.76714285714'>Calidore</entity>, who had another plan, prevented him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='442'>Sitting down by their side, he wakened them gently, told them the time of day, and beginning to talk, asked them questions which would, he hoped, reveal the truth as to Pastorella. And when the brigands in turn questioned Sir Calidore and asked who he and his comrade might be, the knight replied that they were herdsmen who sought for hire. On hearing this the thieves at once offered them wages to take care of their flocks. Sir Calidore accepted the offer, and when night came, he and Coridon returned with the outlaws as their hired servants. They quickly learned all the secrets of the caverns, and to their great joy found that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='joy;secret;cavern' adjectives='great' verbs='live;find;learn' valence='6.81' arousal='4.35571428571' dominance='6.17285714286'>Pastorella</entity> still lived.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='443'>After a time of patient waiting Sir Calidore"s opportunity came. The brigands had returned from a fray and slept soundly. In the dead of night Sir Calidore arose, and armed only with an old sword which he had found, made his way to the new captain"s cavern. Coridon, too cowardly to join boldly with him, too fearful to be left behind, followed faltering. They found the doors fast closed, but Sir Calidore attacked them with all his force and burst them open. The noise awoke the chief brigand, who came rushing to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sir;moment;noise;brigand;slew' adjectives='few;chief' verbs='come;rush;awake' valence='5.36' arousal='4.63333333333' dominance='5.69888888889'>the entrance</entity>, where in a few moments Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;moment;noise;brigand;slew' adjectives='few;chief' verbs='come;rush;awake' valence='5.36' arousal='4.63333333333' dominance='5.69888888889'>Calidore</entity> slew him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='444'>Meantime the sound of the fray struck terror into the heart of Pastorella, but when the well-known and much-loved voice of Sir Calidore called to her, joy and comfort took the place of misery and despair, and her spirit revived within her. His voice was to her as the sunshine to the wintry earth, and she who had longed for death felt the spring of life arise anew within her. Nor did Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;time;arm;distraught' adjectives='strong' verbs='do;rush;rejoice;take;kiss' valence='5.75642857143' arousal='4.54714285714' dominance='5.88214285714'>Calidore</entity> rejoice less: like one distraught he rushed to her, and taking her in his strong arms kissed her a thousand times.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='445'>But now the alarm had roused all the brigand camp, who came flocking to their captain"s cavern. Sir Calidore stood in the doorway, and as they pressed forward, he slew them one by one until the entrance was fairly blocked by dead bodies. Then he rested until daylight dawned; and when there was sufficient light to see his way, he arose, chose from among the slain a trusty sword and went out into the open day. There a great crowd awaited ready to attack him. Then began a terrible fight. On every side the brigands set upon him, and sorely they oppressed him, nor did any spare him; yet so skilled and powerful was Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='enemy;sir;brand;way;slaying;aid;brigand;side' adjectives='powerful;skilled;spare;trusty' verbs='do;set;be;oppress;disperse;come;scatter' valence='5.24470588235' arousal='4.06352941176' dominance='5.39235294118'>Calidore</entity> that by the aid of his trusty brand he dispersed and scattered his enemies, slaying all that came into his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='446'>Now all this time the Blattant Beast was ranging at will, no one stopping or restraining his course. And Sir Calidore deemed it high time to follow his quest once more, although he must first secure the safety of his love. He therefore took her to the Castle Belgard, where dwelt the good Sir Bellamour with Claribell, his wife, and there they were warmly welcomed and hospitably entertained, for Sir Bellamour knew Sir Calidore right well, and had loved him for his prowess ever since they had served together in the field. And Claribell was drawn towards the fair Pastorella, and tended her so lovingly that she soon grew strong and well.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='447'>With ceaseless pains and toils Sir Calidore resumed his task. It was in some respects easier than before, for the Beast had gradually waxed more powerful, and wherever it went left traces of its spoil.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='448'>The knight found that it had invaded the homes of men of all conditions of life and in all had done great damage; that at length it had reached the clergy, and among them had wrought such spoil and havoc, and committed such thefts that to tell all would be impossible. And now Sir Calidore, who had followed its track with ceaseless care, came to a monastery, where he found the Blattant Beast destroying and despoiling with might and main. It had broken into the cloisters and scattered the monks hither and thither; it had pursued them into their cells and had not spared even the holy things of religion. For it broke into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='altar;everything;desk;confusion;chancel' adjectives='' verbs='break;cast;rob;throw;injure' valence='4.60333333333' arousal='4.33222222222' dominance='4.77555555556'>the church</entity> and robbed the chancel; threw down the desks and injured the altar, and cast everything into confusion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='449'>Here Sir Calidore found it; and the Blattant Beast, knowing his power of old, at once fled, but the knight pursued with great swiftness and got nearer and nearer to the monster, until at length he overtook it in a narrow place. Attacking it fiercely, Sir Calidore forced the Beast to turn and face him. Then the knight struck it with his sharp steel, and in return it rushed savagely upon him, its ugly mouth wide open so as to expose the double row of iron teeth, and the thousand yelling, barking, back-biting tongues therein. Not one whit afraid, Sir Calidore fell upon the monster with such might that he obliged it to give way, and for a moment so mastered it that all it could do was to spit forth poisonous venom from its foaming, bloody jaws, threatening in vain to bite. Then rearing itself on its hind legs, it attacked him with its claws as if it would have rent him in pieces. But Sir Calidore was on his guard, and thrust his shield before him; then putting out all his strength he forced the creature back until it fell. Quick as thought <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='strength;shield' adjectives='' verbs='hold;think;fling' valence='6.20166666667' arousal='4.68' dominance='6.32166666667'>the knight</entity> flung his shield upon it, and with all his strength held it down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='450'>At this the Beast raged and roared most horribly, and foamed out bloody gore, and strove in vain to rear itself upright. The more it strove, the firmer the knight held it. It bit, and scratched, and threw out venom, and behaved like a very fiend, so mad was its rage that any should hold it under, and still Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='anger;sir;venom;power;rage' adjectives='mad;greater;fiend' verbs='be;scratch;keep;increase;behave;become;hold;throw' valence='5.03333333333' arousal='4.71833333333' dominance='5.38555555556'>Calidore</entity> kept on, for the more its anger increased the greater became his power.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='451'>Then when the Beast felt it could do nothing against the knight, it began to reveal its deepest, most wicked nature, and used its tongue no longer to spit out blood or venom, but to speak reproaches and to utter wicked lies of Sir Calidore. But even these could not cause this true knight so to forget himself as to grow angry and release his hold for a single moment. He held on tighter and tighter until the Beast was almost strangled in his grasp. At length when he saw that the creature"s power was growing less, he drew forth a muzzle made of the strongest iron, and with it closed its cruel mouth and shut in its blasphemous tongues. To the muzzle he fastened a long chain, and by this drew forth the Blattant Beast, cowed and captive. Never before had any dared to curb its will or restrain its tongues, and it greatly repined at its bondage, inwardly chafing under a restraint which nevertheless it did not dare to withstand. It trembled under Sir Calidore"s mighty hand, and like a beaten dog followed him where he went. Thus was the once powerful Beast led through all Faeryland, its former victims thronging out of the towns to see it captive and to praise and admire its captor. Thus then did Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;chain;liberty;beast;pest;world;lifetime' adjectives='more;scandalous' verbs='break;do;rid;range' valence='5.16142857143' arousal='4.575' dominance='5.11357142857'>Calidore</entity> rid the world during his lifetime of a scandalous pest, although after his days the Beast broke its chain and ranged once more at liberty.</paragraph>

With many tears she had laid it down and watched behind bushes until a shepherd coming to the spot lifted the babe and carried it away.</paragraph>

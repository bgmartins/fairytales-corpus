	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='9'>I. WHAT! NO CHILDREN?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='10'>Once upon a time, so long ago that I have quite forgotten the date, there lived a king and queen who had no children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='11'>And the king said to himself, "All the queens of my acquaintance have children, some three, some seven, and some as many as twelve; and my queen has not one. I feel ill-used." So he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it. But she bore it all like a good patient queen as she was. Then the king grew very cross indeed. But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='joke' adjectives='good' verbs='pretend;take' valence='5.9775' arousal='4.49125' dominance='5.52625'>the queen</entity> pretended to take it all as a joke, and a very good one too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='12'>"Why don"t you have any daughters, at least?" said he. "I don"t say _sons_; that might be too much to expect."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='13'>"I am sure, dear king, I am very sorry," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king' adjectives='sorry' verbs='be;say' valence='5.80444444444' arousal='4.32111111111' dominance='5.76888888889'>the queen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='14'>"So you ought to be," retorted <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='virtue;_' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;make;retort' valence='5.93375' arousal='4.04875' dominance='5.45375'>the king</entity>; "you are not going to make a virtue of _that_, surely."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='15'>But he was not an ill-tempered king, and in any matter of less moment would have let the queen have her own way with all his heart. This, however, was an affair of state.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='16'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='smile' valence='7.205' arousal='4.835' dominance='6.88'>The queen</entity> smiled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='17'>"You must have patience with a lady, you know, dear king," said she.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='18'>She was, indeed, a very nice queen, and heartily sorry that she could not oblige <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='queen' adjectives='sorry;nice' verbs='oblige;be' valence='5.80714285714' arousal='4.26' dominance='5.61428571429'>the king</entity> immediately.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='19'>The king tried to have patience, but he succeeded very badly. It was more than he deserved, therefore, when, at last, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;princess' adjectives='little;lovely;last;more' verbs='be;give;cry;deserve' valence='6.20454545455' arousal='4.68818181818' dominance='5.31818181818'>the queen</entity> gave him a daughter--as lovely a little princess as ever cried.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='22'>II. WON"T I, JUST?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='23'>The day drew near when the infant must be christened. The king wrote all the invitations with his own hand. Of course somebody was forgotten.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='24'>Now it does not generally matter if somebody _is_ forgotten, only you must mind who. Unfortunately, the king forgot without intending to forget; and so the chance fell upon the Princess Makemnoit, which was awkward. For the princess was the king"s own sister; and he ought not to have forgotten her. But she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king, their father, that he had forgotten her in making his will; and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations. But poor relations don"t do anything to keep you in mind of them. Why don"t they? <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='garret' adjectives='' verbs='see;live' valence='6.74' arousal='4.35333333333' dominance='6.01'>The king</entity> could not see into the garret she lived in, could he?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='25'>She was a sour, spiteful creature. The wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness, and made her face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter. If ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody, this king was justified in forgetting his sister, even at a christening. She looked very odd, too. Her forehead was as large as all the rest of her face, and projected over it like a precipice. When she was angry her little eyes flashed blue. When she hated anybody, they shone yellow and green. What they looked like when she loved anybody, I do not know; for I never heard of her loving anybody but herself, and I do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got used to herself. But what made it highly imprudent in the king to forget her was--that she was awfully clever. In fact, she was a witch; and when she bewitched anybody, he very soon had enough of it; for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness, and all the clever ones in cleverness. She despised all the modes we read of in history, in which offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges; and therefore, after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation, she made up her mind at last to go without one, and make the whole family miserable, like a princess as she was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='26'>So she put on her best gown, went to the palace, was kindly received by the happy monarch, who forgot that he had forgotten her, and took her place in the procession to the royal chapel. When they were all gathered about the font, she contrived to get next to it, and throw something into the water; after which she maintained a very respectful demeanour till the water was applied to the child"s face. But at that moment she turned round in her place three times, and muttered the following words, loud enough for those beside her to hear:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='27'>"Light of spirit, by my charms,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='28'>Light of body, every part,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='29'>Never weary human arms--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='30'>Only crush thy parents" heart!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='31'>They all thought she had lost her wits, and was repeating some foolish nursery rhyme; but a shudder went through the whole of them notwithstanding. The baby, on the contrary, began to laugh and crow; while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry, for she thought she was struck with paralysis: she could not feel the baby in her arms. But she clasped it tight and said nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='32'>The mischief was done.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='34'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='35'>III. SHE CAN"T BE OURS</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='36'>Her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity. If you ask me how this was effected, I answer, "In the easiest way in the world. She had only to destroy gravitation." For the princess was a philosopher, and knew all the _ins_ and _outs_ of the laws of gravitation as well as the _ins_ and _outs_ of her boot-lace. And being a witch as well, she could abrogate those laws in a moment; or at least so clog their wheels and rust their bearings, that they would not work at all. But we have more to do with what followed than with how it was done.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='37'>The first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was, that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down, she flew from her arms towards the ceiling. Happily, the resistance of the air brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it. There she remained, horizontal as when she left her nurse"s arms, kicking and laughing amazingly. The nurse in terror flew to the bell, and begged the footman, who answered it, to bring up the house-steps directly. Trembling in every limb, she climbed upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='limb;baby;tail;s;clothes' adjectives='top' verbs='float;reach;stand;have;catch;climb;tremble' valence='5.49142857143' arousal='3.76785714286' dominance='5.545'>the steps</entity>, and had to stand upon the very top, and reach up, before she could catch the floating tail of the baby"s long clothes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='38'>When the strange fact came to be known, there was a terrible commotion in the palace. The occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally a repetition of the nurse"s experience. Astonished that he felt no weight when the child was laid in his arms, he began to wave her up and--not down, for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before, and there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction, as was testified by her peals of tiny laughter. The king stood staring up in speechless amazement, and trembled so that his beard shook like grass in the wind. At last, turning to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horror-struck' adjectives='last' verbs='stare;be;stammer;turn;say;gasp' valence='5.50166666667' arousal='4.44666666667' dominance='5.89333333333'>the queen</entity>, who was just as horror-struck as himself, he said, gasping, staring, and stammering,--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='39'>"She _can"t_ be ours, queen!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='40'>Now <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cause;effect' adjectives='much;cleverer;defective' verbs='come;be;begin;suspect;have' valence='5.319' arousal='3.917' dominance='5.239'>the queen</entity> was much cleverer than <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cause;effect' adjectives='much;cleverer;defective' verbs='come;be;begin;suspect;have' valence='5.319' arousal='3.917' dominance='5.239'>the king</entity>, and had begun already to suspect that "this effect defective came by cause."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='41'>"I am sure she is ours," answered she. "But we ought to have taken better care of her at the christening. People who were never invited ought not to have been present."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='42'>"Oh, ho!" said the king, tapping his forehead with his forefinger, "I have it all. I"ve found her out. Don"t you see it, queen? <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='bewitch;have' valence='6.75' arousal='4.47' dominance='5.73'>Princess Makemnoit</entity> has bewitched her."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='43'>"That"s just what I say," answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s' adjectives='' verbs='answer;say' valence='5.706' arousal='4.696' dominance='5.774'>the queen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='44'>"I beg your pardon, my love; I did not hear you.--John! bring <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='throne' adjectives='' verbs='bring;get' valence='5.434' arousal='4.236' dominance='5.746'>the steps</entity> I get on my throne with."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='46'>The throne-steps were brought, and set upon the dining-table, and John got upon the top of them. But he could not reach the little princess, who lay like a baby-laughter-cloud in the air, exploding continuously.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>IV. WHERE IS SHE?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='52'>One fine summer day, a month after these her first adventures, during which time she had been very carefully watched, the princess was lying on the bed in the queen"s own chamber, fast asleep. One of the windows was open, for it was noon, and the day so sultry that the little girl was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself. The queen came into the room, and not observing that the baby was on the bed, opened another window. A frolicsome fairy wind, which had been watching for a chance of mischief, rushed in at the one window, and taking its way over the bed where the child was lying, caught her up, and rolling and floating her along like a piece of flue, or a dandelion-seed, carried her with it through the opposite window, and away. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='loss;down-stair' adjectives='ignorant' verbs='go;occasion;have' valence='5.215' arousal='4.6' dominance='5.19166666667'>The queen</entity> went down-stairs, quite ignorant of the loss she had herself occasioned.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='53'>When the nurse returned, she supposed that her Majesty had carried her off, and, dreading a scolding, delayed making inquiry about her. But hearing nothing, she grew uneasy, and went at length to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;length;boudoir;majesty;hearing' adjectives='uneasy' verbs='go;s;grow;find' valence='5.6875' arousal='4.2025' dominance='5.60125'>the queen</entity>"s boudoir, where she found her Majesty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='54'>"Please, your Majesty, shall I take the baby?" said she.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='55'>"Where is she?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='6.235' arousal='4.265' dominance='6.165'>the queen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>"Please forgive me. I know it was wrong."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='57'>"What do you mean?" said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grave' adjectives='' verbs='say;look' valence='5.195' arousal='4.445' dominance='5.6325'>the queen</entity>, looking grave.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>"Oh! don"t frighten me, your Majesty!" exclaimed the nurse, clasping her hands.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>The queen saw that something was amiss, and fell down in a faint. The nurse rushed about the palace, screaming, "My baby! my baby!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>Every one ran to the queen"s room. But the queen could give no orders. They soon found out, however, that the princess was missing, and in a moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden; and in one minute more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping of hands. They had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush, to which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her, finishing its mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little white sleeper. Startled by the noise the servants made, she woke, and, furious with glee, scattered the rose-leaves in all directions, like a shower of spray in the sunset.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>She was watched more carefully after this, no doubt; yet it would be endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess. But there never was a baby in a house, not to say a palace, that kept the household in such constant good-humour, at least below-stairs. If it was not easy for her nurses to hold her, at least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache. And she was so nice to play at ball with! There was positively no danger of letting her fall. They might throw her down, or knock her down, or push her down, but couldn"t _let_ her down. It is true, they might let her fly into the fire or the coal-hole, or through the window; but none of these accidents had happened as yet. If you heard peals of laughter resounding from some unknown region, you might be sure enough of the cause. Going down into the kitchen, or _the room_, you would find Jane and Thomas, and Robert and Susan, all and sum, playing at ball with the little princess. She was the ball herself, and did not enjoy it the less for that. Away she went, flying from one to another, screeching with laughter. And the servants loved the ball itself better even than the game. But they had to take some care how they threw her, for if she received an upward direction, she would never come down again without being fetched.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>But above-stairs it was different.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>The operation gave him no pleasure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>"To think," said he to himself, "that every one of these gold sovereigns weighs a quarter of an ounce, and my real, live, flesh-and-blood princess weighs nothing at all!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>And he hated his gold sovereigns, as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>The queen was in the parlour, eating bread and honey. But at the second mouthful she burst out crying, and could not swallow it. The king heard her sobbing. Glad of anybody, but especially of his queen, to quarrel with, he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box, clapped his crown on his head, and rushed into the parlour.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>"What is all this about?" exclaimed he. "What are you crying for, queen?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>Meantime, notwithstanding awkward occurrences, and griefs that she brought upon her parents, the little princess laughed and grew--not fat, but plump and tall. She reached the age of seventeen, without having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney; by rescuing her from which, a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face. Nor, thoughtless as she was, had she committed anything worse than laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way. When she was told, for the sake of experiment, that General Clanrunfort was cut to pieces with all his troops, she laughed; when she heard that the enemy was on his way to besiege her papa"s capital, she laughed hugely; but when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the mercy of the enemy"s soldiery--why, then she laughed immoderately. She never could be brought to see the serious side of anything. When her mother cried, she said,--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>"What queer faces mamma makes! And she squeezes water out of her cheeks? Funny mamma!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='110'>And when her papa stormed at her, she laughed, and danced round and round him, clapping her hands, and crying,--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>"Do it again, papa. Do it again! It"s such fun! Dear, funny papa!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='112'>And if he tried to catch her, she glided from him in an instant, not in the least afraid of him, but thinking it part of the game not to be caught. With one push of her foot, she would be floating in the air above his head; or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and sideways, like a great butterfly. It happened several times, when her father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private, that they were interrupted by vainly repressed outbursts of laughter over their heads; and looking up with indignation, saw her floating at full length in the air above them, whence she regarded them with the most comical appreciation of the position.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='113'>One day an awkward accident happened. The princess had come out upon the lawn with one of her attendants, who held her by the hand. Spying her father at the other side of the lawn, she snatched her hand from the maid"s, and sped across to him. Now when she wanted to run alone, her custom was to catch up a stone in each hand, so that she might come down again after a bound. Whatever she wore as part of her attire had no effect in this way: even gold, when it thus became as it were a part of herself, lost all its weight for the time. But whatever she only held in her hands retained its downward tendency. On this occasion she could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad, that was walking across the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in. Not knowing what disgust meant, for this was one of her peculiarities, she snatched up the toad and bounded away. She had almost reached her father, and he was holding out his arms to receive her, and take from her lips the kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud, when a puff of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page, who had just been receiving a message from his Majesty. Now it was no great peculiarity in the princess that, once she was set agoing, it always cost her time and trouble to check herself. On this occasion there was no time. She _must_ kiss--and she kissed the page. She did not mind it much; for she had no shyness in her composition; and she knew, besides, that she could not help it. So she only laughed, like a musical box. The poor page fared the worst. For the princess, trying to correct the unfortunate tendency of the kiss, put out her hands to keep her off the page; so that, along with the kiss, he received, on the other cheek, a slap with the huge black toad, which she poked right into his eye. He tried to laugh, too, but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion of countenance, as showed that there was no danger of his pluming himself on the kiss. As for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='dignity;page' adjectives='whole' verbs='be;speak;do;hurt' valence='5.588' arousal='3.974' dominance='5.651'>the king</entity>, his dignity was greatly hurt, and he did not speak to the page for a whole month.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>I may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run, if her mode of progression could properly be called running. For first she would make a bound; then, having alighted, she would run a few steps, and make another bound. Sometimes she would fancy she had reached the ground before she actually had, and her feet would go backwards and forwards, running upon nothing at all, like those of a chicken on its back. Then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun; only in her laugh there was something missing. What it was, I find myself unable to describe. I think it was a certain tone, depending upon the possibility of sorrow--_morbidezza_, perhaps. She never smiled.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='148'>Now at the head of this college were two very wise Chinese philosophers--by name, Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck. For them the king sent; and straightway they came. In a long speech he communicated to them what they knew very well already--as who did not?--namely, the peculiar condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt; and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause and probable cure of her _infirmity_. The king laid stress upon the word, but failed to discover his own pun. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hum-drum;silence;humility' adjectives='' verbs='retire;hear;laugh' valence='6.34333333333' arousal='4.27166666667' dominance='6.285'>The queen</entity> laughed; but Hum-Drum and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hum-drum;silence;humility' adjectives='' verbs='retire;hear;laugh' valence='6.34333333333' arousal='4.27166666667' dominance='6.285'>Kopy-Keck</entity> heard with humility and retired in silence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='149'>The consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting, for the thousandth time, each his favourite theories. For the condition of the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every question arising from the division of thought--in fact, of all the Metaphysics of the Chinese Empire. But it is only justice to say that they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical question, _what was to be done_.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='150'>Hum-Drum was a Materialist, and Kopy-Keck was a spiritualist. The former was slow and sententious; the latter was quick and flighty: the latter had generally the first word; the former the last.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='151'>"I reassert my former assertion," began Kopy-Keck, with a plunge. "There is not a fault in the princess, body or soul; only they are wrong put together. Listen to me now, Hum-Drum, and I will tell you in brief what I think. Don"t speak. Don"t answer me. I _won"t_ hear you till I have done.-- At that decisive moment, when souls seek their appointed habitations, two eager souls met, struck, rebounded, lost their way, and arrived each at the wrong place. The soul of the princess was one of those, and she went far astray. She does not belong by rights to this world at all, but to some other planet, probably Mercury. Her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal frame. She cares for nothing here. There is no relation between her and this world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='152'>"She must therefore be taught, by the sternest compulsion, to take an interest in the earth as the earth. She must study every department of its history--its animal history; its vegetable history; its mineral history; its social history; its moral history; its political history; its scientific history; its literary history; its musical history; its artistical history; above all, its metaphysical history. She must begin with the Chinese dynasty and end with Japan. But first of all she must study geology, and especially the history of the extinct races of animals--their natures, their habits, their loves, their hates, their revenges. She must--"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='153'>"Hold, h-o-o-old!" roared Hum-Drum. "It is certainly my turn now. My rooted and insubvertible conviction is, that the causes of the anomalies evident in the princess"s condition are strictly and solely physical. But that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist. Hear my opinion.--From some cause or other, of no importance to our inquiry, the motion of her heart has been reversed. That remarkable combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way--I mean in the case of the princess: it draws in where it should force out, and forces out where it should draw in. The offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted. The blood is sent forth by the veins, and returns by the arteries. Consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism--lungs and all. Is it then at all mysterious, seeing that such is the case, that on the other particular of gravitation as well, she should differ from normal humanity? My proposal for the cure is this:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='154'>"Phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety. Let it be affected, if necessary, in a warm bath. When she is reduced to a state of perfect asphyxy, apply a ligature to the left ankle, drawing it as tight as the bone will bear. Apply, at the same moment, another of equal tension around the right wrist. By means of plates constructed for the purpose, place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air-pumps. Exhaust the receivers. Exhibit a pint of French brandy, and await the result."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='160'>VIII. TRY A DROP OF WATER.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='161'>Perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in love. But how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is a difficulty--perhaps _the_ difficulty. As for her own feelings on the subject, she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey and stings to be fallen into. But now I come to mention another curious fact about her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='162'>The palace was built on the shore of the loveliest lake in the world; and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother. The root of this preference no doubt, although the princess did not recognize it as such, was, that the moment she got into it, she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived--namely, gravity. Whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury, I do not know. But it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was. The manner in which this alleviation of her misfortune was discovered was as follows:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='163'>One summer evening, during the carnival of the country, she had been taken upon the lake by the king and queen, in the royal barge. They were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats. In the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor"s barge, for his daughter, who was a great favourite with her, was in it with her father. Now though the old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune, yet, happening on this occasion to be in a particularly good humour, as the barges approached each other, he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor"s barge. He lost his balance, however, and, dropping into the bottom of the barge, lost his hold of his daughter; not, however, before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person, though in a somewhat different direction; for, as the king fell into the boat, she fell into the water. With a burst of delightful laughter she disappeared in the lake. A cry of horror ascended from the boats. They had never seen the princess go down before. Half the men were under water in a moment; but they had all, one after another, come up to the surface again for breath, when--tinkle, tinkle, babble, and gush! came the princess"s laugh over the water from far away. There she was, swimming like a swan. Nor would she come out for king or queen, chancellor or daughter. She was perfectly obstinate.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='164'>But at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual. Perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing. At all events, after this, the passion of her life was to get into the water, and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it. Summer and winter it was quite the same; only she could not stay so long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in. Any day, from morning till evening in summer, she might be descried--a streak of white in the blue water--lying as still as the shadow of a cloud, or shooting along like a dolphin; disappearing, and coming up again far off, just where one did not expect her. She would have been in the lake of a night, too, if she could have had her way; for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it; and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water, and no one would have been any the wiser. Indeed, when she happened to wake in the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation. But there was the sad difficulty of getting into it. She had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water. For the slightest gust of wind would blow her away; and a gust might arise in the stillest moment. And if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it, her situation would be dreadfully awkward, irrespective of the wind; for at best there she would have to remain, suspended in her night-gown, till she was seen and angled for by someone from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='push;water;someone;wind;situation' adjectives='irrespective;night-gown;best;awkward' verbs='be;suspend;angle;give;reach;see;remain;have;fail' valence='5.50052631579' arousal='3.96263157895' dominance='5.31368421053'>the window</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='165'>"Oh! if I had my gravity," thought she, contemplating the water, "I would flash off this balcony like a long white sea-bird, headlong into the darling wetness. Heigh-ho!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='166'>This was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='167'>Another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom. For she could not walk out without a _cortge_, consisting in part of a troop of light horse, for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her. And the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years, till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress, and held by twenty noblemen. Of course horseback was out of the question. But she bade good-bye to all this ceremony when she got into the water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='168'>And so remarkable were its effects upon her, especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity, that Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years; in the hope that, as the water did her so much good, the earth would do her yet more. But the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment, and would not give his consent. Foiled in this, they yet agreed in another recommendation; which, seeing that the one imported his opinions from China and the other from Thibet, was very remarkable indeed. They argued that, if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious, water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure; in short, that if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry, she might recover her lost gravity.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='169'>But how was this to be brought about? Therein lay all the difficulty--to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough. To make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh. They sent for a professional beggar; commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe; helped him, out of the court charade-box, to whatever he wanted for dressing up, and promised great rewards in the event of his success. But it was all in vain. She listened to the mendicant artist"s story, and gazed at his marvellous make-up, till she could contain herself no longer, and went into the most undignified contortions for relief, shrieking, positively screeching with laughter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='170'>When she had a little recovered herself, she ordered her attendants to drive him away, and not give him a single copper; whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge, for it sent her into violent hysterics, from which she was with difficulty recovered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='171'>But so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial, that he put himself in a rage one day, and, rushing up to her room, gave her an awful whipping. Yet not a tear would flow. She looked grave, and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming--that was all. The good old tyrant, though he put on his best gold spectacles to look, could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her eyes.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='175'>It must have been about this time that the son of a king, who lived a thousand miles from Lagobel, set out to look for the daughter of a queen. He travelled far and wide, but as sure as he found a princess, he found some fault in her. Of course he could not marry a mere woman, however beautiful; and there was no princess to be found worthy of him. Whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself, I cannot pretend to say. All I know is, that he was a fine, handsome, brave, generous, well-bred, and well-behaved youth, as all princes are.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='176'>In his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess; but as everybody said she was bewitched, he never dreamed that she could bewitch him. For what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity? Who could tell what she might not lose next? She might lose her visibility, or her tangibility; or, in short, the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium; so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive. Of course he made no further inquiries about her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='177'>One day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest. These forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers, like a sieve that keeps back the bran. Then the princes get away to follow their fortunes. In this they have the advantage of the princesses, who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun. I wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='178'>One lovely evening, after wandering about for many days, he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest; for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them; and he soon came upon a kind of heath. Next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood; but by this time it was getting late, and there was nobody in the fields to direct him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='179'>After travelling for another hour, his horse, quite worn out with long labour and lack of food, fell, and was unable to rise again. So he continued his journey on foot. At length he entered another wood--not a wild forest, but a civilized wood, through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake. Along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness. Suddenly he paused, and listened. Strange sounds came across the water. It was, in fact, the princess laughing. Now there was something odd in her laugh, as I have already hinted, for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity; and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming. Looking over the lake, he saw something white in the water; and, in an instant, he had torn off his tunic, kicked off his sandals, and plunged in. He soon reached the white object, and found that it was a woman.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='225'>So perfectly like other people had she been in the water, that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly, grasp the balcony, and disappear through the window. He turned, almost expecting to see her still by his side. But he was alone in the water. So he swam away quietly, and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber. As soon as they disappeared, he landed in search of his tunic and sword, and, after some trouble, found them again. Then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side. There the wood was wilder, and the shore steeper--rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides, and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night, and all night long. He soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess"s room, and where, even in the broad daylight, he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore. It was a sort of cave in the rock, where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves, and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake.

Whenever Care intruded, this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='230'>When he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave, he saw the princess already floating about in the lake, attended by the king or queen--whom he knew by their crowns--and a great company in lovely little boats, with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow, and flags and streamers of a great many more. It was a very bright day, and soon the prince, burned up with the heat, began to long for the cold water and the cool princess. But he had to endure till twilight; for the boats had provisions on board, and it was not till the sun went down that the gay party began to vanish. Boat after boat drew away to the shore, following that of the king and queen, till only one, apparently the princess"s own boat, remained. But she did not want to go home even yet, and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her. At all events, it rowed away; and now, of all the radiant company, only one white speck remained.

She shot to the surface, and, without a word, swam at full speed towards the higher side of the lake. He followed, begging to know if she was ill, or what was the matter. She never turned her head, or took the smallest notice of his question. Arrived at the shore, she coasted the rocks with minute inspection. But she was not able to come to a conclusion, for the moon was very small, and so she could not see well.

It was fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and festering, full of lovely creatures dying, and ugly creatures coming to life, like the unmaking of a world.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='286'>Now the fact was that the old princess was at the root of the mischief. When she heard that her niece found more pleasure in the water than anyone else out of it, she went into a rage, and cursed herself for her want of foresight.</paragraph>

Then she threw some powder into the water, and stirred it with her bare arm, muttering over it words of hideous sound, and yet more hideous import. Then she set the tub aside, and took from the chest a huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys, that clattered in her shaking hands. Then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all. Before she had finished, out from the tub, the water of which had kept on a slow motion ever since she had ceased stirring it, came the head and half the body of a huge gray snake. But the witch did not look round. It grew out of the tub, waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow horizontal motion, till it reached the princess, when it laid its head upon her shoulder, and gave a low hiss in her ear. She started--but with joy; and seeing the head resting on her shoulder, drew it towards her and kissed it. Then she drew it all out of the tub, and wound it round her body. It was one of those dreadful creatures which few have ever beheld--the White Snakes of Darkness.</paragraph>

She locked this also behind her, and descended a few more steps. If anyone had followed the witch-princess, he would have heard her unlock exactly one hundred doors, and descend a few steps after unlocking each. When she had unlocked the last, she entered a vast cave, the roof of which was supported by huge natural pillars of rock. Now this roof was the under side of the bottom of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='side;roof;bottom' adjectives='under' verbs='be' valence='5.344' arousal='3.16' dominance='5.434'>the lake</entity>.</paragraph>

It then began to move its head backwards and forwards, with a slow oscillating motion, as if looking for something. At the same moment the witch began to walk round and round the cavern, coming nearer to the centre every circuit; while the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she did over the floor, for she kept holding it up.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='295'>She let it go, left it hanging, and sat down on a great stone, with her black cat, which had followed her all round the cave, by her side. Then she began to knit and mutter awful words. The snake hung like a huge leech, sucking at the stone; the cat stood with his back arched, and his tail like a piece of cable, looking up at the snake; and the old woman sat and knitted and muttered. Seven days and seven nights they remained thus; when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if exhausted, and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried seaweed. The witch started to her feet, picked it up, put it in her pocket, and looked up at the roof. One drop of water was trembling on the spot where the snake had been sucking. As soon as she saw that, she turned and fled, followed by her cat. Shutting the door in a terrible hurry, she locked it, and having muttered some frightful words, sped to the next, which also she locked and muttered over; and so with all the hundred doors, till she arrived in her own cellar. There she sat down on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='delight;water;door' adjectives='ready;faint;malicious' verbs='rush;listen;hear;sit' valence='5.725' arousal='4.055' dominance='5.91916666667'>the floor</entity> ready to faint, but listening with malicious delight to the rushing of the water, which she could hear distinctly through all the hundred doors.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='296'>But this was not enough. Now that she had tasted revenge, she lost her patience. Without further measures, the lake would be too long in disappearing. So the next night, with the last shred of the dying old moon rising, she took some of the water in which she had revived the snake, put it in a bottle, and set out, accompanied by her cat. Before morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake, muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream, and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle. When she had finished the circuit she muttered yet again, and flung a handful of water towards the moon. Thereupon every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble, dying away like the pulse of a dying man. The next day there was no sound of falling water to be heard along the borders of the lake. The very courses were dry; and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='300'>Never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly had the prince had a single interview with her. He had seen her once or twice in the lake; but as far as he could discover, she had not been in it any more at night. He had sat and sung, and looked in vain for his Nereid; while she, like a true Nereid, was wasting away with her lake, sinking as it sank, withering as it dried. When at length he discovered the change that was taking place in the level of the water, he was in great alarm and perplexity. He could not tell whether the lake was dying because the lady had forsaken it; or whether the lady would not come because the lake had begun to sink. But he resolved to know so much at least.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='301'>He disguised himself, and, going to the palace, requested to see the lord chamberlain. His appearance at once gained his request; and the lord chamberlain, being a man of some insight, perceived that there was more in the prince"s solicitation than met the ear. He felt likewise that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties might arise. So he granted the prince"s prayer to be made shoe-black to the princess. It was rather cunning in the prince to request such an easy post, for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as other princesses. He soon learned all that could be learned about the princess. He went nearly distracted; but after roaming about <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pair;diving;depth;boot;polish' adjectives='dainty;extra' verbs='do;be;distract;put;remain;call;roam;go' valence='5.80833333333' arousal='3.60722222222' dominance='5.65722222222'>the lake</entity> for days, and diving in every depth that remained, all that he could do was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never called for.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='302'>For the princess kept her room, with the curtains drawn to shut out the dying lake. But she could not shut it out of her mind for a moment. It haunted her imagination so that she felt as if the lake were her soul, drying up within her, first to mud, then to madness and death. She thus brooded over the change, with all its dreadful accompaniments, till she was nearly distracted. As for the prince, she had forgotten him. However much she had enjoyed his company in the water, she did not care for him without it. But she seemed to have forgotten her father and mother too. The lake went on sinking. Small slimy spots began to appear, which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the water. These grew to broad patches of mud, which widened and spread, with rocks here and there, and floundering fishes and crawling eels swarming. The people went everywhere catching these, and looking for anything that might have dropped from the royal boats.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='304'>It happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake.

It was a plate of gold covered with writing.

All the pent-up crying of her life was spent now. And a rain came on, such as had never been seen in that country. The sun shone all the time, and the great drops, which fell straight to the earth, shone likewise. The palace was in the heart of a rainbow. It was a rain of rubies, and sapphires, and emeralds, and topazes. The torrents poured from the mountains like molten gold; and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet, the lake would have overflowed and inundated the country. It was full from shore to shore.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='458'>Of course the prince and princess were betrothed at once. But the princess had to learn to walk, before they could be married with any propriety.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='474'>Somewhere near these borders, on the other side, by the edge of a great forest, lived a labourer with his wife and a great many children. One day Tricksey-Wee, as they called her, teased her brother Buffy-Bob, till he could not bear it any longer, and gave her a box on the ear. Tricksey-Wee cried; and Buffy-Bob was so sorry and so ashamed of himself that he cried too, and ran off into the wood. He was so long gone that Tricksey-Wee began to be frightened, for she was very fond of her brother; and she was so distressed that she had first teased him and then cried, that at last she ran into the wood to look for him, though there was more chance of losing herself than of finding him. And, indeed, so it seemed likely to turn out; for, running on without looking, she at length found herself in a valley she knew nothing about. And no wonder; for what she thought was a valley with round, rocky sides, was no other than the space between two of the roots of a great tree that grew on the borders of Giantland. She climbed over the side of it, and went towards what she took for a black, round-topped mountain, far away; but which she soon discovered to be close to her, and to be a hollow place so great that she could not tell what it was hollowed out of. Staring at it, she found that it was a doorway; and going nearer and staring harder, she saw the door, far in, with a knocker of iron upon it, a great many yards above her head, and as large as the anchor of a big ship. Now, nobody had ever been unkind to Tricksey-Wee, and therefore she was not afraid of anybody. For Buffy-Bob"s box on the ear she did not think worth considering. So spying a little hole at the bottom of the door which had been nibbled by some giant mouse, she crept through it, and found herself in an enormous hall. She could not have seen the other end of it at all, except for the great fire that was burning there, diminished to a spark in the distance. Towards this fire she ran as fast as she could, and was not far from it when something fell before her with a great clatter, over which she tumbled, and went rolling on the floor. She was not much hurt however, and got up in a moment. Then she saw that what she had fallen over was not unlike a great iron bucket. When she examined it more closely, she discovered that it was a thimble; and looking up to see who had dropped it, beheld a huge face, with spectacles as big as the round windows in a church, bending over her, and looking everywhere for the thimble. Tricksey-Wee immediately laid hold of it in both her arms, and lifted it about an inch nearer to the nose of the peering giantess. This movement made the old lady see where it was, and, her finger popping into it, it vanished from the eyes of Tricksey-Wee, buried in the folds of a white stocking like a cloud in the sky, which Mrs. Giant was busy darning. For it was Saturday night, and her husband would wear nothing but white stockings on Sunday. To be sure he did eat little children, but only _very_ little ones; and if ever it crossed his mind that it was wrong to do so, he always said to himself that he wore whiter stockings on Sunday than any other giant in all Giantland.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='489'>Tricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob peered through the bristles, and discovered a row of little boys, about a dozen, with very fat faces and goggle eyes, sitting before the fire, and looking stupidly into it.

Now and then, however, he could not keep his teeth off them, and would eat one by the bye, without salt.</paragraph>

Now, what made them very wretched indeed was, that they knew if they could only keep from eating, and grow thin, the giant would dislike them, and turn them out to find their way home; but notwithstanding this, so greedy were they, that they ate as much as ever they could hold. The giantess, who fed them, comforted herself with thinking that they were not real boys and girls, but only little pigs pretending to be boys and girls.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='491'>"Now tell me the truth," cried the giant, bending his face down over them.

See what comes of lying!" asked no more questions; for, as he always kept his word, he was afraid he might have to do the same to them all; and he did not like boiled boys. He like to eat them crisp, as radishes, whether forked or not, ought to be eaten. He then sat down, and asked his wife if his supper was ready. She looked into the pot, and throwing the boy out with the ladle, as if he had been a black beetle that had tumbled in and had had the worst of it, answered that she thought it was. Whereupon he rose to help her; and taking the pot from the fire, poured the whole contents, bubbling and splashing, into a dish like a vat. Then they sat down to supper. The children in the broom could not see what they had; but it seemed to agree with them, for the giant talked like thunder, and the giantess answered like the sea, and they grew chattier and chattier.

I can warrant no one else will touch it while she has got it. But she is rather capricious, and I confess I am not easy about it; for the least scratch of one of her claws would do for me at once.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='528'>The fact was, they were creeping along a channel in the heart of a giant tree; and the noise they heard was the noise of the sap rushing along in its wooden pipes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='529'>"It sounds kind and good," said Tricksey. "It is water running. Now it must be running from somewhere to somewhere. I think we had better go on, and we shall come somewhere."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='530'>It was now rather difficult to go on, for they had to climb as if they were climbing a hill; and now the passage was wide. Nearly worn out, they saw light overhead at last, and creeping through a crack into the open air, found themselves on the fork of a huge tree. A great, broad, uneven space lay around them, out of which spread boughs in every direction, the smallest of them as big as the biggest tree in the country of common people. Overhead were leaves enough to supply all the trees they had ever seen. Not much moonlight could come through, but the leaves would glimmer white in the wind at times. The tree was full of giant birds. Every now and then, one would sweep through, with a great noise. But, except an occasional chirp, sounding like a shrill pipe in a great organ, they made no noise. All at once an owl began to hoot. He thought he was singing. As soon as he began, other birds replied, making rare game of him. To their astonishment, the children found they could understand every word they sang. And what they sang was something like this:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='531'>"I will sing a song.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='532'>I"m the Owl."   "Sing a song, you Sing-song</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='540'>The owl spread out his silent, soft, sly wings, and lighting between Tricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob, nearly smothered them, closing up one under each wing. It was like being buried in a down bed. But the owl did not like anything between his sides and his wings, so he opened his wings again, and the children made haste to get out. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='courtesy;spectacles;eye;s;round;giantess;front;face;bird;mr.' adjectives='huge;bigger' verbs='be;look;whisper;drop;say;want;go' valence='5.98944444444' arousal='4.29166666667' dominance='5.53277777778'>Tricksey-Wee</entity> immediately went in front of the bird, and looking up into his huge face, which was as round as the eyes of the giantess"s spectacles, and much bigger, dropped a pretty courtesy, and said,--"Please, Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='courtesy;spectacles;eye;s;round;giantess;front;face;bird;mr.' adjectives='huge;bigger' verbs='be;look;whisper;drop;say;want;go' valence='5.98944444444' arousal='4.29166666667' dominance='5.53277777778'>Owl</entity>, I want to whisper to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='541'>"Very well, small child," answered the owl, looking important, and stooping his ear towards her. "What is it?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='543'>"Oh, you naughty child! That"s a secret. For shame!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='544'>And with a great hiss that terrified them, the owl flew into the tree. All birds are fond of secrets; but not many of them can keep them so well as the owl.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='545'>So the children went on because they did not know what else to do. They found the way very rough and difficult, the tree was so full of humps and hollows. Now and then they plashed into a pool of rain; now and then they came upon twigs growing out of the trunk where they had no business, and they were as large as full-grown poplars. Sometimes they came upon great cushions of soft moss, and on one of them they lay down and rested. But they had not lain long before they spied a large nightingale sitting on a branch, with its bright eyes looking up at the moon. In a moment more he began to sing, and the birds about him began to reply, but in a different tone from that in which they had replied to the owl. Oh, the birds did call the nightingale such pretty names! The nightingale sang, and the birds replied like this:--</paragraph>

When the nightingale stopped they got up and wandered on. They did not know where they were going, but they thought it best to keep going on, because then they might come upon something or other. They were very sorry they had forgotten to ask the nightingale about the eagle"s nest, but his music had put everything else out of their heads. They resolved, however, not to forget the next time they had a chance.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='659'>"Well, it"s no business of mine," rejoined Lady Lark, a little offended, and quite vexed that she had told them. So she flew away to find some breakfast for her little ones, who by this time were chirping very impatiently. The children looked at each other, joined hands, and walked off.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='660'>In a minute more the sun was up, and they soon reached the outside of the tree. The bark was so knobby and rough, and full of twigs, that they managed to get down, though not without great difficulty. Then, far away to the north, they saw a huge peak, like the spire of a church, going right up into the sky. They thought this must be Mount Skycrack, and turned their faces towards it. As they went on, they saw a giant or two, now and then, striding about the fields or through the woods, but they kept out of their way. Nor were they in much danger; for it was only one or two of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='giant;child;danger' adjectives='fond;much' verbs='be' valence='5.683' arousal='3.988' dominance='5.454'>the border</entity> giants that were so very fond of children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='661'>At last they came to the foot of Mount Skycrack.

The whole face of it, from top to bottom, was covered with a network of spiders" webs, with threads of various sizes, from that of silk to that of whipcord. The webs shook and quivered, and waved in the sun, glittering like silver. All about ran huge greedy spiders, catching huge silly flies, and devouring them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='662'>Here they sat down to consider what could be done. The spiders did not heed them, but ate away at the flies.--Now, at the foot of the mountain, and all round it, was a ring of water, not very broad, but very deep. As they sat watching them, one of the spiders, whose web was woven across this water, somehow or other lost his hold, and fell in on his back. Tricksey-Wee and Buffy-Bob ran to his assistance, and laying hold each of one of his legs, succeeded, with the help of the other legs, which struggled spiderfully, in getting him out upon dry land. As soon as he had shaken himself, and dried himself a little, the spider turned to the children, saying,--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='663'>"And now, what can I do for you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='664'>"Tell us, please," said they, "how we can get up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;nest' adjectives='she-eagle' verbs='say;please;tell;get' valence='5.85428571429' arousal='3.93857142857' dominance='5.79857142857'>the mountain</entity> to the she-eagle"s nest."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='669'>"My dear child," answered the spider, in a tone of injured dignity, "I eat nothing but what is mischievous or useless. You have helped me, and now I will help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='670'>The children rose at once, and climbing as well as they could, reached the spider"s nest in the centre of the web. Nor did they find it very difficult; for whenever too great a gap came, the spider spinning a strong cord stretched it just where they would have chosen to put their feet next. He left them in his nest, after bringing them two enormous honey-bags, taken from bees that he had caught; but presently about six of the wisest of the spiders came back with him. It was rather horrible to look up and see them all round the mouth of the nest, looking down on them in contemplation, as if wondering whether they would be nice eating. At length one of them said,--"Tell us truly what you want with the eagle, and we will try to help you."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='674'>"Ah! but you might do better than that," said the spider.--"Now we have resolved to help you. Here is a little bag of spider-juice. The giants cannot bear spiders, and this juice is dreadful poison to them. We are all ready to go up with you, and drive the eagle away.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='675'>"But how can we do that?" said Buffy. "The bag is not much bigger than a pudding-bag."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='677'>"Yes; but what are we to do with the heart?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='678'>"Put it in the bag, to be sure. Only, first, you must squeeze a drop out of the other bag upon it. You will see what will happen."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='679'>"Very well; we will do as you tell us," said Tricksey-Wee. "And now, if you please, how shall we go?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='680'>"Oh, that"s our business," said the first spider. "You come with me, and my grandfather will take your brother. Get up."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='681'>So Tricksey-Wee mounted on the narrow part of the spider"s back, and held fast. And Buffy-Bob got on the grandfather"s back. And up they scrambled, over one web after another, up and up--so fast!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='682'>"What can we want with so many?" she thought; but she said nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='683'>The moon was now up, and it was a splendid sight below and around them. All Giantland was spread out under them, with its great hills, lakes, trees, and animals. And all above them was the clear heaven, and Mount Skycrack rising into it, with its endless ladders of spider-webs, glittering like cords made of moonbeams. And up the moonbeams went, crawling, and scrambling, and racing, a huge army of huge spiders.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='684'>At length they reached all but the very summit, where they stopped.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='687'>Up rushed the whole army, past the children, over the edge of the nest, on to the she-eagle, and buried themselves in her feathers. In a moment she became very restless, and went pecking about with her beak. All at once she spread out her wings, with a sound like a whirlwind, and flew off to bathe in the sea; and then the spiders began to drop from her in all directions on their gossamer wings. The children had to hold fast to keep the wind of the eagle"s flight from blowing them off. As soon as it was over, they looked into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='heart;s;thing' adjectives='awful;ugly' verbs='be;look;lay' valence='5.14727272727' arousal='4.28454545455' dominance='5.24'>the nest</entity>, and there lay <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;s;thing' adjectives='awful;ugly' verbs='be;look;lay' valence='5.14727272727' arousal='4.28454545455' dominance='5.24'>the giant</entity>"s heart--an awful and ugly thing.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='689'>So Tricksey took her bag, and squeezed a drop out of it upon the heart.

It shrunk and shrivelled till it was nearly gone; and Buffy-Bob caught it up and put it into his bag. Then the two spiders turned and went down again as fast as they could. Before they got to the bottom, they heard the shrieks of the she-eagle over the loss of her egg; but the spiders told them not to be alarmed, for her eyes were too big to see them.--By the time they reached the foot of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fly;spider;nothing;time;foot;home' adjectives='busy' verbs='be;get;reach;have;catch;happen' valence='5.72428571429' arousal='3.95214285714' dominance='5.43214285714'>the mountain</entity>, all the spiders had got home, and were busy again catching flies, as if nothing had happened.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='741'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='742'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='743'>There was a boy who used to sit in the twilight and listen to his great-aunt"s stories.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='745'>"And what is the key for?" the boy would ask. "What is it the key of? What will it open?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='746'>"That nobody knows," his aunt would reply. "He has to find that out."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='748'>"Better never find it than sell it," returned his aunt.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='749'>Now, all that his great-aunt told the boy about the golden key would have been nonsense, had it not been that their little house stood on the borders of Fairyland. For it is perfectly well known that out of Fairyland nobody ever can find where the rainbow stands. The creature takes such good care of its golden key, always flitting from place to place, lest anyone should find it! But in Fairyland it is quite different. Things that look real in this country look very thin indeed in Fairyland, while some of the things that here cannot stand still for a moment, will not move there. So it was not in the least absurd of the old lady to tell her nephew such things about the golden key.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='750'>"Did you ever know anybody find it?" he asked one evening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='751'>"Yes. Your father, I believe, found it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='757'>"I don"t know. There it is."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='758'>"Perhaps it is the rainbow"s egg."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='759'>"Perhaps it is. You will be a happy boy if you find <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='boy' adjectives='happy' verbs='be;find' valence='6.13' arousal='4.05142857143' dominance='5.93714285714'>the nest</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='760'>"Perhaps it comes tumbling down the rainbow from the sky."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='761'>"Perhaps it does."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='762'>One evening, in summer, he went into his own room, and stood at the lattice-window, and gazed into the forest which fringed the outskirts of Fairyland. It came close up to his great-aunt"s garden, and, indeed, sent some straggling trees into it. The forest lay to the east, and the sun, which was setting behind the cottage, looked straight into the dark wood with his level red eye. The trees were all old, and had few branches below, so that the sun could see a great way into the forest; and the boy, being keen-sighted, could see almost as far as the sun. The trunks stood like rows of red columns in the shine of the red sun, and he could see down aisle after aisle in the vanishing distance. And as he gazed into the forest he began to feel as if the trees were all waiting for him, and had something they could not go on with till he came to them. But he was hungry, and wanted his supper. So he lingered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='763'>Suddenly, far among the trees, as far as the sun could shine, he saw a glorious thing. It was the end of a rainbow, large and brilliant. He could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before. Only the spring of the rainbow-arch was visible. He could see nothing of it above the trees.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='764'>"The golden key!" he said to himself, and darted out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;dart' valence='5.92' arousal='3.9375' dominance='6.3175'>the house</entity>, and into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;dart' valence='5.92' arousal='3.9375' dominance='6.3175'>the wood</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='765'>He had not gone far before the sun set. But the rainbow only glowed the brighter: for the rainbow of Fairyland is not dependent upon the sun as ours is. The trees welcomed him. The bushes made way for him. The rainbow grew larger and brighter; and at length he found himself within two trees of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='766'>It was a grand sight, burning away there in silence, with its gorgeous, its lovely, its delicate colours, each distinct, all combining. He could now see a great deal more of it. It rose high into the blue heavens, but bent so little that he could not tell how high the crown of the arch must reach. It was still only a small portion of a huge bow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='767'>He stood gazing at it till he forgot himself with delight--even forgot the key which he had come to seek. And as he stood it grew more wonderful still. For in each of the colours, which was as large as the column of a church, he could faintly see beautiful forms slowly ascending as if by the steps of a winding stair. The forms appeared irregularly--now one, now many, now several, now none--men and women and children--all different, all beautiful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='768'>He drew nearer to the rainbow. It vanished. He started back a step in dismay. It was there again, as beautiful as ever. So he contented himself with standing as near it as he might, and watching the forms that ascended the glorious colours towards the unknown height of the arch, which did not end abruptly, but faded away in the blue air, so gradually that he could not say where it ceased.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='769'>When the thought of the golden key returned, the boy very wisely proceeded to mark out in his mind the space covered by the foundation of the rainbow, in order that he might know where to search, should the rainbow disappear. It was based chiefly upon a bed of moss.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='770'>Meantime it had grown quite dark in the wood. The rainbow alone was visible by its own light. But the moment the moon rose the rainbow vanished. Nor could any change of place restore the vision to the boy"s eyes. So he threw himself down upon the mossy bed, to wait till the sunlight would give him a chance of finding the key. There he fell fast asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='771'>When he woke in the morning the sun was looking straight into his eyes. He turned away from it, and the same moment saw a brilliant little thing lying on the moss within a foot of his face. It was the golden key. The pipe of it was of plain gold, as bright as gold could be. The handle was curiously wrought and set with sapphires. In a terror of delight he put out his hand and took it, and had it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='772'>He lay for a while, turning it over and over, and feeding his eyes upon its beauty. Then he jumped to his feet, remembering that the pretty thing was of no use to him yet. Where was the lock to which the key belonged? It must be somewhere, for how could anybody be so silly as make a key for which there was no lock? Where should he go to look for it? He gazed about him, up into the air, down to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tree;grass;keyhole;cloud;air' adjectives='' verbs='see;gaze' valence='6.2575' arousal='3.61375' dominance='5.56875'>the earth</entity>, but saw no keyhole in the clouds, in the grass, or in the trees.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='773'>Just as he began to grow disconsolate, however, he saw something glimmering in the wood. It was a mere glimmer that he saw, but he took it for a glimmer of rainbow, and went towards it.--And now I will go back to the borders of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='border' adjectives='' verbs='go' valence='5.46' arousal='4.015' dominance='5.435'>the forest</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='774'>Not far from the house where the boy had lived there was another house, the owner of which was a merchant, who was much away from home. He had lost his wife some years before, and had only one child, a little girl, whom he left to the charge of two servants, who were very idle and careless. So she was neglected and left untidy, and was sometimes ill-used besides.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='775'>Now, it is well known that the little creatures commonly called fairies, though there are many different kinds of fairies in Fairyland, have an exceeding dislike to untidiness. Indeed, they are quite spiteful to slovenly people. Being used to all the lovely ways of the trees and flowers, and to the neatness of the birds and all woodland creatures, it makes them feel miserable, even in their deep woods and on their grassy carpets, to think that within the same moonlight lies a dirty, uncomfortable, slovenly house. And this makes them angry with the people that live in it, and they would gladly drive them out of the world if they could. They want the whole earth nice and clean. So they pinch the maids black and blue, and play them all manner of uncomfortable tricks.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='776'>But this house was quite a shame, and the fairies in the forest could not endure it. They tried everything on the maids without effect, and at last resolved upon making a clean riddance, beginning with the child. They ought to have known that it was not her fault, but they have little principle and much mischief in them, and they thought that if they got rid of her the maids would be sure to be turned away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='777'>So one evening, the poor little girl having been put to bed early, before the sun was down, the servants went off to the village, locking the door behind them. The child did not know she was alone, and lay contentedly looking out of her window towards the forest, of which, however, she could not see much, because of the ivy and other creeping plants which had straggled across her window. All at once she saw an ape making faces at her out of the mirror, and the heads carved upon a great old wardrobe grinning fearfully. Then two old spider-legged chairs came forward into the middle of the room, and began to dance a queer, old-fashioned dance. This set her laughing, and she forgot the ape and the grinning heads. So the fairies saw they had made a mistake, and sent the chairs back to their places. But they knew that she had been reading the story of Silverhair all day. So the next moment she heard the voices of the three bears upon the stair, big voice, middle voice, and little voice, and she heard their soft, heavy tread, as if they had had stockings over their boots, coming nearer and nearer to the door of her room, till she could bear it no longer. She did just as Silverhair did, and as the fairies wanted her to do: she darted to the window, pulled it open, got upon the ivy, and so scrambled to the ground. She then fled to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='fast' verbs='run;flee' valence='5.64333333333' arousal='4.87666666667' dominance='5.38333333333'>the forest</entity> as fast as she could run.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='778'>Now, although she did not know it, this was the very best way she could have gone; for nothing is ever so mischievous in its own place as it is out of it; and, besides, these mischievous creatures were only the children of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wanderer;being;one;place;way;child;nothing;creature' adjectives='good;many;able;evil;own;mischievous;other;best;more' verbs='do;help;get;hurt;know;have;go;be' valence='5.73633333333' arousal='3.80566666667' dominance='5.56133333333'>Fairyland</entity>, as it were, and there are many other beings there as well; and if a wanderer gets in among them, the good ones will always help him more than the evil ones will be able to hurt him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='779'>The sun was now set, and the darkness coming on, but the child thought of no danger but the bears behind her. If she had looked round, however, she would have seen that she was followed by a very different creature from a bear. It was a curious creature, made like a fish, but covered, instead of scales, with feathers of all colours, sparkling like those of a humming-bird. It had fins, not wings, and swam through the air as a fish does through the water. Its head was like the head of a small owl.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='780'>After running a long way, and as the last of the light was disappearing, she passed under a tree with drooping branches. It dropped its branches to the ground all about her, and caught her as in a trap. She struggled to get out, but the branches pressed her closer and closer to the trunk. She was in great terror and distress, when the air-fish, swimming into the thicket of branches, began tearing them with its beak. They loosened their hold at once, and the creature went on attacking them, till at length they let the child go. Then the air-fish came from behind her, and swam on in front, glittering and sparkling all lovely colours; and she followed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='781'>It led her gently along till all at once it swam in at a cottage-door. The child followed still. There was a bright fire in the middle of the floor, upon which stood a pot without a lid, full of water that boiled and bubbled furiously. The air-fish swam straight to the pot and into the boiling water, where it lay quiet. A beautiful woman rose from the opposite side of the fire and came to meet the girl. She took her up in her arms, and said,--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='782'>"Ah, you are come at last! I have been looking for you a long time."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='783'>She sat down with her on her lap, and there the girl sat staring at her. She had never seen anything so beautiful. She was tall and strong, with white arms and neck, and a delicate flush on her face. The child could not tell what was the colour of her hair, but could not help thinking it had a tinge of dark green. She had not one ornament upon her, but she looked as if she had just put off quantities of diamonds and emeralds. Yet here she was in the simplest, poorest little cottage, where she was evidently at home. She was dressed in shining green.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='812'>She took off the girl"s night-gown, rose with her in her arms, and going to the wall of the cottage, opened a door. Then Tangle saw a deep tank, the sides of which were filled with green plants, which had flowers of all colours. There was a roof over it like the roof of the cottage. It was filled with beautiful clear water, in which swam a multitude of such fishes as the one that had led her to the cottage. It was the light their colours gave that showed the place in which they were.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='814'>The fishes came crowding about her. Two or three of them got under her head and kept it up.

Then the lady, who had been looking on all the time, spoke again; whereupon some thirty or forty of the fishes rose out of the water underneath Tangle, and so bore her up to the arms the lady held out to take her.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='820'>"I know what you mean," returned the lady. "You do not like to eat the messenger that brought you home. But it is the kindest return you can make. The creature was afraid to go until it saw me put the pot on, and heard me promise it should be boiled the moment it returned with you. Then it darted out of the door at once. You saw it go into the pot of itself the moment it entered, did you not?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='821'>"I did," answered Tangle, "and I thought it very strange; but then I saw you, and forgot all about the fish."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='822'>"In Fairyland," resumed the lady, as they sat down to the table, "the ambition of the animals is to be eaten by the people; for that is their highest end in that condition. But they are not therefore destroyed. Out of that pot comes something more than the dead fish, you will see."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='823'>Tangle now remarked that the lid was on the pot. But the lady took no further notice of it till they had eaten the fish, which Tangle found nicer than any fish she had ever tasted before. It was as white as snow, and as delicate as cream. And the moment she had swallowed a mouthful of it, a change she could not describe began to take place in her. She heard a murmuring all about her, which became more and more articulate, and at length, as she went on eating, grew intelligible. By the time she had finished her share, the sounds of all the animals in the forest came crowding through the door to her ears; for the door still stood wide open, though it was pitch dark outside; and they were no longer sounds only; they were speech, and speech that she could understand. She could tell what the insects in the cottage were saying to each other too. She had even a suspicion that the trees and flowers all about <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tree;flower;suspicion;communication' adjectives='other' verbs='be;say;hold;hear;have' valence='6.06538461538' arousal='3.99076923077' dominance='5.94230769231'>the cottage</entity> were holding midnight communications with each other; but what they said she could not hear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='824'>As soon as the fish was eaten, the lady went to the fire and took the lid off the pot. A lovely little creature in human shape, with large white wings, rose out of it, and flew round and round the roof of the cottage; then dropped, fluttering, and nestled in the lap of the lady. She spoke to it some strange words, carried it to the door, and threw it out into the darkness. Tangle heard the flapping of its wings die away in the distance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='825'>"Now have we done the fish any harm?" she said, returning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='826'>"No," answered Tangle, "I do not think we have. I should not mind eating one every day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='827'>"They must wait their time, like you and me too, my little Tangle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='828'>And she smiled a smile which the sadness in it made more lovely.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='831'>"I want one of you," she said,--"the wisest."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='832'>Thereupon the fishes got together in the middle of the tank, with their heads forming a circle above the water, and their tails a larger circle beneath it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='837'>Tangle was soon lost in the strangest, loveliest dreams. And the beautiful lady was in every one of her dreams.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='838'>In the morning she woke to the rustling of leaves over her head, and the sound of running water. But, to her surprise, she could find no door--nothing but the moss-grown wall of the cottage. So she crept through an opening in the arbour, and stood in the forest. Then she bathed in a stream that ran merrily through the trees, and felt happier; for having once been in her grandmother"s pond, she must be clean and tidy ever after; and, having put on her green dress, felt like a lady.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='839'>She spent that day in the wood, listening to the birds and beasts and creeping things. She understood all that they said, though she could not repeat a word of it; and every kind had a different language, while there was a common though more limited understanding between all the inhabitants of the forest. She saw nothing of the beautiful lady, but she felt that she was near her all the time; and she took care not to go out of sight of the cottage. It was round, like a snow-hut or a wigwam; and she could see neither door nor window in it. The fact was, it had no windows; and though it was full of doors, they all opened from the inside, and could not even be seen from the outside.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='840'>She was standing at the foot of a tree in the twilight, listening to a quarrel between a mole and a squirrel, in which the mole told the squirrel that the tail was the best of him, and the squirrel called the mole Spade-fists, when, the darkness having deepened around her, she became aware of something shining in her face, and looking round, saw that the door of the cottage was open, and the red light of the fire flowing from it like a river through the darkness. She left Mole and Squirrel to settle matters as they might, and darted off to the cottage. Entering, she found the pot boiling on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pot;lady;side' adjectives='lovely;other;grand' verbs='sit;find;boil;enter' valence='5.85818181818' arousal='4.07727272727' dominance='5.92090909091'>the fire</entity>, and the grand, lovely lady sitting on the other side of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='841'>"I"ve been watching you all day," said the lady. "You shall have something to eat by and by, but we must wait till our supper comes home."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='842'>She took Tangle on her knee, and began to sing to her--such songs as made her wish she could listen to them for ever. But at length in rushed the shining fish, and snuggled down in the pot. It was followed by a youth who had outgrown his worn garments. His face was ruddy with health, and in his hand he carried a little jewel, which sparkled in the firelight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='843'>The first words <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word' adjectives='' verbs='be;say' valence='6.42' arousal='4.162' dominance='6.17'>the lady</entity> said were,--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='845'>Now Mossy was the name his companions had given him, because he had a favourite stone covered with moss, on which he used to sit whole days reading; and they said <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;mossy;name;moss;companion' adjectives='favourite;whole' verbs='be;use;sit;read;give;cover;begin;say;have;grow' valence='6.01888888889' arousal='3.65166666667' dominance='5.81944444444'>the moss</entity> had begun to grow upon him too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='846'>Mossy held out his hand. The moment the lady saw that it was the golden key, she rose from her chair, kissed Mossy on the forehead, made him sit down on her seat, and stood before him like a servant.

But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tear;eye' adjectives='beautiful' verbs='wait;let;beg;sit' valence='5.53375' arousal='3.98875' dominance='5.5325'>the lady</entity> begged him, with tears in her beautiful eyes, to sit, and let her wait on him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='847'>"But you are a great, splendid, beautiful lady," said Mossy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='848'>"Yes, I am. But I work all day long--that is my pleasure; and you will have to leave me so soon!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='849'>"How do you know that, if you please, madam?" asked Mossy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='850'>"Because you have got the golden key."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='856'>"You may stop here to-night, and have some of my supper. But you must go in the morning. All I can do for you is to give you clothes. Here is a girl called Tangle, whom you must take with you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='857'>"That _will_ be nice," said Mossy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='858'>"No, no!" said Tangle. "I don"t want to leave you, please, Grandmother."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='859'>"You must go with him, Tangle. I am sorry to lose you, but it will be the best thing for you.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='860'>So saying, she took the fish from the pot, and put the lid on as before.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='861'>The lady then showed Mossy into just such another chamber as that of Tangle; and in the morning he found a suit of clothes laid beside him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='865'>"That I will," said Mossy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='866'>And Tangle cast a glance at him, and thought she should like to go with him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='868'>She kissed Tangle on the mouth and Mossy on the forehead, led them to the door, and waved her hand eastward. Mossy and Tangle took each other"s hand and walked away into the depth of the forest. In his right hand Mossy held the golden key.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='869'>They wandered thus a long way, with endless amusement from the talk of the animals. They soon learned enough of their language to ask them necessary questions. The squirrels were always friendly, and gave them nuts out of their own hoards; but the bees were selfish and rude, justifying themselves on the ground that Tangle and Mossy were not subjects of their queen, and charity must begin at home, though indeed they had not one drone in their poorhouse at the time. Even the blinking moles would fetch them an earth-nut or a truffle now and then, talking as if their mouths, as well as their eyes and ears, were full of cotton wool, or their own velvety fur. By the time they got out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='grandmother;mossy;tangle;time' adjectives='sorry;fond;other;least' verbs='be;send;have;get' valence='5.94583333333' arousal='3.74666666667' dominance='5.59333333333'>the forest</entity> they were very fond of each other, and Tangle was not in the least sorry that her grandmother had sent her away with Mossy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='870'>At length the trees grew smaller, and stood farther apart, and the ground began to rise, and it got more and more steep, till the trees were all left behind, and the two were climbing a narrow path with rocks on each side. Suddenly they came upon a rude doorway, by which they entered a narrow gallery cut in the rock. It grew darker and darker, till it was pitch-dark, and they had to feel their way. At length the light began to return, and at last they came out upon a narrow path on the face of a lofty precipice. This path went winding down the rock to a wide plain, circular in shape, and surrounded on all sides by mountains. Those opposite to them were a great way off, and towered to an awful height, shooting up sharp, blue, ice-enamelled pinnacles. An utter silence reigned where they stood. Not even the sound of water reached them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='871'>Looking down, they could not tell whether the valley below was a grassy plain or a great still lake. They had never seen any space look like it. The way to it was difficult and dangerous, but down the narrow path they went, and reached the bottom in safety. They found it composed of smooth, light-coloured sandstone, undulating in parts, but mostly level. It was no wonder to them now that they had not been able to tell what it was, for this surface was everywhere crowded with shadows. The mass was chiefly made up of the shadows of leaves innumerable, of all lovely and imaginative forms, waving to and fro, floating and quivering in the breath of a breeze whose motion was unfelt, whose sound was unheard. No forests clothed the mountain-sides, no trees were anywhere to be seen, and yet the shadows of the leaves, branches, and stems of all various trees covered the valley as far as their eyes could reach. They soon spied the shadows of flowers mingled with those of the leaves, and now and then the shadow of a bird with open beak, and throat distended with song. At times would appear the forms of strange, graceful creatures, running up and down the shadow-boles and along the branches, to disappear in the wind-tossed foliage. As they walked they waded knee-deep in the lovely lake. For the shadows were not merely lying on the surface of the ground, but heaped up above it like substantial forms of darkness, as if they had been cast upon a thousand different planes of the air. Tangle and Mossy often lifted their heads and gazed upwards to discry whence the shadows came; but they could see nothing more than a bright mist spread above them, higher than the tops of the mountains, which stood clear against it. No forests, no leaves, no birds were visible.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='872'>After a while, they reached more open spaces, where the shadows were thinner; and came even to portions over which shadows only flitted, leaving them clear for such as might follow. Now a wonderful form, half bird-like half human, would float across on outspread sailing pinions. Anon an exquisite shadow group of gambolling children would be followed by the loveliest female form, and that again by the grand stride of a Titanic shape, each disappearing in the surrounding press of shadowy foliage. Sometimes a profile of unspeakable beauty or grandeur would appear for a moment and vanish. Sometimes they seemed lovers that passed linked arm in arm, sometimes father and son, sometimes brothers in loving contest, sometimes sisters entwined in gracefullest community of complex form. Sometimes wild horses would tear across, free, or bestrode by noble shadows of ruling men. But some of the things which pleased them most they never knew how to describe.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='877'>So he lay down on the ground, and about him on every side, and over his head, was the constant play of the wonderful shadows. He could look through them, and see the one behind the other, till they mixed in a mass of darkness. Tangle, too, lay admiring, and wondering, and longing after the country whence the shadows came. When they were rested they rose and pursued their journey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='878'>How long they were in crossing this plain I cannot tell; but before night Mossy"s hair was streaked with gray, and Tangle had got wrinkles on her forehead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='879'>As evening grew on, the shadows fell deeper and rose higher. At length they reached a place where they rose above their heads, and made all dark around them. Then they took hold of each other"s hand, and walked on in silence and in some dismay. They felt the gathering darkness, and something strangely solemn besides, and the beauty of the shadows ceased to delight them. All at once Tangle found that she had not a hold of Mossy"s hand, though when she lost it she could not tell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='880'>"Mossy, Mossy!" she cried aloud in terror.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='881'>But no Mossy replied.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='882'>A moment after, the shadows sank to her feet, and down under her feet, and the mountains rose before her. She turned towards the gloomy region she had left, and called once more upon Mossy.

She threw herself down and wept in despair.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='883'>Suddenly she remembered that the beautiful lady had told them, if they lost each other in a country of which she could not remember the name, they were not to be afraid, but to go straight on.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='887'>When she opened her eyes, she saw a beautiful little figure with wings standing beside her, waiting.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='888'>"I know you," said Tangle. "You are my fish."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='889'>"Yes. But I am a fish no longer. I am an aranth now."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='893'>Thereupon the aranth took to his wings, and flew on through the long, narrow passage, reminding Tangle very much of the way he had swum on before her when he was a fish. And the moment his white wings moved, they began to throw off a continuous shower of sparks of all colours, which lighted up the passage before them.--All at once he vanished, and Tangle heard a low, sweet sound, quite different from the rush and crackle of his wings. Before her was an open arch, and through it came light, mixed with the sound of sea-waves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='894'>She hurried out, and fell, tired and happy, upon the yellow sand of the shore. There she lay, half asleep with weariness and rest, listening to the low plash and retreat of the tiny waves, which seemed ever enticing the land to leave off being land, and become sea. And as she lay, her eyes were fixed upon the foot of a great rainbow standing far away against the sky on the other side of the sea. At length she fell fast asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='895'>When she awoke, she saw an old man with long white hair down to his shoulders, leaning upon a stick covered with green buds, and so bending over her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='904'>For there she hoped to find Mossy again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='905'>"Ah! indeed, that would be worth doing," said the old man. "But I cannot, for I do not know the way myself. But I will send you to the Old Man of the Earth. Perhaps he can tell you. He is much older than I am."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='906'>Leaning on his staff, he conducted her along the shore to a steep rock, that looked like a petrified ship turned upside down. The door of it was the rudder of a great vessel, ages ago at the bottom of the sea. Immediately within the door was a stair in the rock, down which the old man went, and Tangle followed. At the bottom the old man had his house, and there he lived.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='907'>As soon as she entered it, Tangle heard a strange noise, unlike anything she had ever heard before. She soon found that it was the fishes talking. She tried to understand what they said; but their speech was so old-fashioned, and rude, and undefined, that she could not make much of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='908'>"I will go and see about those fishes for my daughter," said the Old Man of the Sea.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='909'>And moving a slide in the wall of his house, he first looked out, and then tapped upon a thick piece of crystal that filled the round opening. Tangle came up behind him, and peeping through the window into the heart of the great deep green ocean, saw the most curious creatures, some very ugly, all very odd, and with especially queer mouths, swimming about everywhere, above and below, but all coming towards the window in answer to the tap of the Old Man of the Sea. Only a few could get their mouths against the glass; but those who were floating miles away yet turned their heads towards it. The old man looked through the whole flock carefully for some minutes, and then turning to Tangle, said,--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='910'>"I am sorry I have not got one ready yet. I want more time than she does. But I will send some as soon as I can."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='911'>He then shut the slide.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='912'>Presently a great noise arose in the sea. The old man opened the slide again, and tapped on the glass, whereupon the fishes were all as still as sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='913'>"They were only talking about you," he said. "And they do speak such nonsense!--To-morrow," he continued, "I must show you the way to the Old Man of the Earth. He lives a long way from here."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='914'>"Do let me go at once," said Tangle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='915'>"No. That is not possible. You must come this way first."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='916'>He led her to a hole in the wall, which she had not observed before. It was covered with the green leaves and white blossoms of a creeping plant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='917'>"Only white-blossoming plants can grow under the sea," said the old man. "In there you will find a bath, in which you must lie till I call you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='918'>Tangle went in, and found a smaller room or cave, in the further corner of which was a great basin hollowed out of a rock, and half-full of the clearest sea-water. Little streams were constantly running into it from cracks in the wall of the cavern. It was polished quite smooth inside, and had a carpet of yellow sand in the bottom of it. Large green leaves and white flowers of various plants crowded up and over it, draping and covering it almost entirely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='919'>No sooner was she undressed and lying in the bath, than she began to feel as if the water were sinking into her, and she were receiving all the good of sleep without undergoing its forgetfulness. She felt the good coming all the time. And she grew happier and more hopeful than she had been since she lost Mossy. But she could not help thinking how very sad it was for a poor old man to live there all alone, and have to take care of a whole seaful of stupid and riotous fishes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='920'>After about an hour, as she thought, she heard his voice calling her, and rose out of the bath. All the fatigue and aching of her long journey had vanished. She was as whole, and strong, and well as if she had slept for seven days.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='921'>Returning to the opening that led into the other part of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='form;opening;face;part;amazement;man' adjectives='majestic;beautiful;other;grand' verbs='start;see;return;lead;wait' valence='5.81315789474' arousal='4.23947368421' dominance='5.73842105263'>the house</entity>, she started back with amazement, for through it she saw the form of a grand man, with a majestic and beautiful face, waiting for her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='922'>"Come," he said; "I see you are ready."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='923'>She entered with reverence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='924'>"Where is the Old Man of the Sea?" she asked, humbly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='925'>"There is no one here but me," he answered, smiling. "Some people call me the Old Man of the Sea. Others have another name for me, and are terribly frightened when they meet me taking a walk by the shore. Therefore I avoid being seen by them, for they are so afraid, that they never see what I really am. You see me now.--But I must show you <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='show' valence='5.38714285714' arousal='4.28285714286' dominance='5.15285714286'>the way</entity> to the Old Man of the Earth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='926'>He led her into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='corner;rock;opening;bath' adjectives='opposite' verbs='be;see;lead' valence='5.41363636364' arousal='3.83909090909' dominance='5.32727272727'>the cave</entity> where the bath was, and there she saw, in the opposite corner, a second opening in the rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='927'>"Go down that stair, and it will bring you to him," said the Old Man of the Sea.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='928'>With humble thanks Tangle took her leave. She went down the winding stair, till she began to fear there was no end to it. Still down and down it went, rough and broken, with springs of water bursting out of the rocks and running down the steps beside her. It was quite dark about her, and yet she could see. For after being in that bath, people"s eyes always give out a light they can see by. There were no creeping things in the way. All was safe and pleasant though so dark and damp and deep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='929'>At last there was not one step more, and she found herself in a glimmering cave. On a stone in the middle of it sat a figure with its back towards her--the figure of an old man bent double with age. From behind she could see his white beard spread out on the rocky floor in front of him. He did not move as she entered, so she passed round that she might stand before him and speak to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='930'>The moment she looked in his face, she saw that he was a youth of marvellous beauty. He sat entranced with the delight of what he beheld in a mirror of something like silver, which lay on the floor at his feet, and which from behind she had taken for his white beard. He sat on, heedless of her presence, pale with the joy of his vision. She stood and watched him. At length, all trembling, she spoke. But her voice made no sound. Yet the youth lifted up his head. He showed no surprise, however, at seeing her--only smiled a welcome.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='931'>"Are you the Old Man of the Earth?" Tangle had said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='932'>And the youth answered, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='youth;ear' adjectives='' verbs='answer;hear' valence='5.824' arousal='3.956' dominance='5.75'>Tangle</entity> heard him, though not with her ears:--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='935'>"Ah! that I do not know. I only dream about it myself. I see its shadows sometimes in my mirror: the way to it I do not know. But I think the Old Man of the Fire must know. He is much older than I am. He is the oldest man of all."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='936'>"Where does he live?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='937'>"I will show you the way to his place. I never saw him myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='938'>So saying, the young man rose, and then stood for a while gazing at Tangle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='939'>"I wish I could see that country too," he said. "But I must mind my work."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='940'>He led her to the side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ear;side' adjectives='' verbs='tell;lead;lay' valence='5.48571428571' arousal='3.63428571429' dominance='5.38714285714'>the cave</entity>, and told her to lay her ear against <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ear;side' adjectives='' verbs='tell;lead;lay' valence='5.48571428571' arousal='3.63428571429' dominance='5.38714285714'>the wall</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='941'>"What do you hear?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='942'>"I hear," answered Tangle, "the sound of a great water running inside the rock."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='943'>"That river runs down to the dwelling of the oldest man of all--the Old Man of the Fire. I wish I could go to see him. But I must mind my work. That river is the only way to him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='944'>Then the Old Man of the Earth stooped over the floor of the cave, raised a huge stone from it, and left it leaning. It disclosed a great hole that went plumb-down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='945'>"That is <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;say' valence='6.0' arousal='3.58666666667' dominance='5.73666666667'>the way</entity>," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='946'>"But there are no stairs."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='947'>"You must throw yourself in. There is no other way."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='948'>She turned and looked him full in the face--stood so for a whole minute, as she thought: it was a whole year--then threw herself headlong into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='face' adjectives='full;whole' verbs='be;look;throw;turn;stand;think' valence='5.718' arousal='3.83466666667' dominance='5.57466666667'>the hole</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='949'>When she came to herself, she found herself gliding down fast and deep. Her head was under water, but that did not signify, for, when she thought about it, she could not remember that she had breathed once since her bath in the cave of the Old Man of the Sea. When she lifted up her head a sudden and fierce heat struck her, and she sank it again instantly, and went sweeping on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='950'>Gradually the stream grew shallower. At length she could hardly keep her head under. Then the water could carry her no farther. She rose from the channel, and went step for step down the burning descent. The water ceased altogether. The heat was terrible. She felt scorched to the bone, but it did not touch her strength. It grew hotter and hotter. She said, "I can bear it no longer." Yet she went on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='951'>At the long last, the stair ended at a rude archway in an all but glowing rock. Through this archway Tangle fell exhausted into a cool mossy cave. The floor and walls were covered with moss--green, soft, and damp. A little stream spouted from a rent in the rock and fell into a basin of moss. She plunged her face into it and drank. Then she lifted her head and looked around. Then she rose and looked again. She saw no one in the cave. But the moment she stood upright she had a marvellous sense that she was in the secret of the earth and all its ways. Everything she had seen, or learned from books; all that her grandmother had said or sung to her; all the talk of the beasts, birds, and fishes; all that had happened to her on her journey with Mossy, and since then in the heart of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beast;word;heart;journey;fish;mossy;grandmother;everything;book;thing;bird;talk;man' adjectives='same' verbs='be;say;see;understand;have;learn;put;sing;happen;mean' valence='5.85413793103' arousal='4.00344827586' dominance='5.77034482759'>the earth</entity> with the Old man and the Older man--all was plain: she understood it all, and saw that everything meant the same thing, though she could not have put it into words again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='952'>The next moment she descried, in a corner of the cave, a little naked child sitting on the moss. He was playing with balls of various colours and sizes, which he disposed in strange figures upon the floor beside him. And now Tangle felt that there was something in her knowledge which was not in her understanding. For she knew there must be an infinite meaning in the change and sequence and individual forms of the figures into which the child arranged the balls, as well as in the varied harmonies of their colours, but what it all meant she could not tell.* He went on busily, tirelessly, playing his solitary game, without looking up, or seeming to know that there was a stranger in his deep-withdrawn cell. Diligently as a lace-maker shifts her bobbins, he shifted and arranged his balls. Flashes of meaning would now pass from them to Tangle, and now again all would be not merely obscure, but utterly dark. She stood looking for a long time, for there was fascination in the sight; and the longer she looked the more an indescribable vague intelligence went on rousing itself in her mind. For seven years she had stood there watching the naked child with his coloured balls, and it seemed to her like seven hours, when all at once the shape the balls took, she knew not why, reminded her of the Valley of Shadows, and she spoke:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='953'>"Where is the Old Man of the Fire?" she said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='954'>* I think I must be indebted to Novalis for these geometrical figures.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='955'>"Here I am," answered the child, rising and leaving his balls on the moss. "What can I do for you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='956'>There was such an awfulness of absolute repose on the face of the child that Tangle stood dumb before him. He had no smile, but the love in his large gray eyes was deep as the centre. And with the repose there lay on his face a shimmer as of moonlight, which seemed as if any moment it might break into such a ravishing smile as would cause the beholder to weep himself to death. But the smile never came, and the moonlight lay there unbroken. For the heart of the child was too deep for any smile to reach from it to his face.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='957'>"Are you the oldest man of all?" Tangle at length, although filled with awe, ventured to ask.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='958'>"Yes, I am. I am very, very old. I am able to help you, I know. I can help everybody." And the child drew near and looked up in her face so that she burst into tears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='959'>"Can you tell me the way to the country the shadows fall from?" she sobbed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='960'>"Yes. I know the way quite well. I go there myself sometimes. But you could not go my way; you are not old enough. I will show you how you can go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='961'>"Do not send me out into the great heat again," prayed Tangle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='962'>"I will not," answered the child.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='963'>And he reached up, and put his little cool hand on her heart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='964'>"Now," he said, "you can go. The fire will not burn you. Come."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='965'>He led her from the cave, and following him through another archway, she found herself in a vast desert of sand and rock. The sky of it was of rock, lowering over them like solid thunderclouds; and the whole place was so hot that she saw, in bright rivulets, the yellow gold and white silver and red copper trickling molten from the rocks. But the heat never came near her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='966'>When they had gone some distance, the child turned up a great stone, and took something like an egg from under it. He next drew a long curved line in the sand with his finger, and laid the egg in it. He then spoke something Tangle could not understand. The egg broke, a small snake came out, and, lying in the line in the sand, grew and grew till he filled it. The moment he was thus full-grown, he began to glide away, undulating like a sea-wave.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='967'>"Follow that serpent," said the child. "He will lead you the right way."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='968'>Tangle followed the serpent. But she could not go far without looking back at the marvellous child. He stood alone in the midst of the glowing desert, beside a fountain of red flame that had burst forth at his feet, his naked whiteness glimmering a pale rosy red in the torrid fire. There he stood, looking after her, till, from the lengthening distance, she could see him no more. The serpent went straight on, turning neither to the right nor left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='969'>Meantime Mossy had got out of the Lake of Shadows, and, following his mournful, lonely way, had reached the sea-shore. It was a dark, stormy evening. The sun had set. The wind was blowing from the sea. The waves had surrounded the rock within which lay the old man"s house. A deep water rolled between it and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;figure' adjectives='majestic;deep' verbs='be;roll;walk' valence='5.719' arousal='4.001' dominance='5.402'>the shore</entity>, upon which a majestic figure was walking alone.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='976'>Mossy followed him. The waves flew from before the footsteps of the Old Man of the Sea, and Mossy followed upon dry sand.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='978'>Now Mossy was an old man by this time. He looked much older than the Old Man of the Sea, and his feet were very weary.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='979'>After looking at him for a moment, the old man took him by the hand and led him into his inner cave. There he helped him to undress, and laid him in the bath. And he saw that one of his hands Mossy did not open.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='980'>"What have you in that hand?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='981'>Mossy opened his hand, and there lay the golden key.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='982'>"Ah!" said the old man, "that accounts for your knowing me. And I know <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='go;know;have' valence='5.982' arousal='3.904' dominance='5.332'>the way</entity> you have to go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='983'>"I want to find <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shadow;mossy' adjectives='' verbs='say;whence;find;want;fall' valence='5.49428571429' arousal='4.18428571429' dominance='5.44285714286'>the country</entity> whence the shadows fall," said Mossy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='984'>"I dare say you do. So do I. But meantime, one thing is certain.--What is that key for, do you think?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='985'>"For a key-hole somewhere. But I don"t know why I keep it. I never could find the key-hole. And I have lived a good while, I believe," said Mossy, sadly. "I"m not sure that I"m not old. I know my feet ache."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='986'>"Do they?" said the old man, as if he really meant to ask the question; and Mossy, who was still lying in the bath, watched his feet for a moment before he replied,--"No, they do not. Perhaps I am not old either."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='987'>"Get up and look at yourself in the water."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='988'>He rose and looked at himself in the water, and there was not a gray hair on his head or a wrinkle on his skin.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='989'>"You have tasted of death now," said the old man. "Is it good?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='990'>"It is good," said Mossy. "It is better than life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='991'>"No, said the old man: it is only more life.--Your feet will make no holes in the water now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='992'>"What do you mean?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='993'>"I will show you that presently."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='994'>They returned to the outer cave, and sat and talked together for a long time. At length the Old Man of the Sea rose, and said to Mossy,--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='995'>"Follow me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='996'>He led him up the stair again, and opened another door. They stood on the level of the raging sea, looking towards the east. Across the waste of waters, against the bosom of a fierce black cloud, stood the foot of a rainbow, glowing in the dark.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='997'>"This indeed is my way," said Mossy, as soon as he saw the rainbow, and stepped out upon the sea. His feet made no holes in the water. He fought the wind, and clomb the waves, and went on towards the rainbow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='998'>The storm died away. A lovely day and a lovelier night followed. A cool wind blew over the wide plain of the quiet ocean. And still Mossy journeyed eastward. But the rainbow had vanished with the storm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='999'>Day after day he held on, and he thought he had no guide. He did not see how a shining fish under the water directed his steps. He crossed the sea, and came to a great precipice of rock, up which he could discover but one path. Nor did this lead him farther than half-way up the rock, where it ended on a platform. Here he stood and pondered.--It could not be that the way stopped here, else what was the path for? It was a rough path, not very plain, yet certainly a path.--He examined the face of the rock. It was smooth as glass. But as his eyes kept roving hopelessly over it, something glittered, and he caught sight of a row of small sapphires. They bordered a little hole in the rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1000'>"The key-hole!" he cried.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1001'>He tried the key. It fitted. It turned. A great clang and clash, as of iron bolts on huge brazen caldrons, echoed thunderously within. He drew out the key. The rock in front of him began to fall. He retreated from it as far as the breadth of the platform would allow. A great slab fell at his feet. In front was still the solid rock, with this one slab fallen forward out of it. But the moment he stepped upon it, a second fell, just short of the edge of the first, making the next step of a stair, which thus kept dropping itself before him as he ascended into the heart of the precipice. It led him into a hall fit for such an approach--irregular and rude in formation, but floor, sides, pillars, and vaulted roof, all one mass of shining stones of every colour that light can show. In the centre stood seven columns, ranged from red to violet. And on the pedestal of one of them sat a woman, motionless, with her face bowed upon her knees. Seven years had she sat there waiting. She lifted her head as Mossy drew near. It was Tangle. Her hair had grown to her feet, and was rippled like the windless sea on broad sands. Her face was beautiful, like her grandmother"s, and as still and peaceful as that of the Old Man of the Fire. Her form was tall and noble. Yet Mossy knew her at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1002'>"How beautiful you are, Tangle!" he said, in delight and astonishment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1003'>"Am I?" she returned. "Oh, I have waited for you so long! But you, you are like the Old Man of the Sea. No. You are like the Old Man of the Earth. No, no. You are like the oldest man of all. You are like them all. And yet you are my own old Mossy! How did you come here? What did you do after I lost you? Did you find the key-hole? Have you got the key still?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1004'>She had a hundred questions to ask him, and he a hundred more to ask her. They told each other all their adventures, and were as happy as man and woman could be. For they were younger and better, and stronger and wiser, than they had ever been before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1005'>It began to grow dark. And they wanted more than ever to reach the country whence the shadows fall. So they looked about them for a way out of the cave. The door by which Mossy entered had closed again, and there was half a mile of rock between them and the sea. Neither could Tangle find the opening in the floor by which the serpent had led her thither. They searched till it grew so dark that they could see nothing, and gave it up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1006'>After a while, however, the cave began to glimmer again. The light came from the moon, but it did not look like moonlight, for it gleamed through those seven pillars in the middle, and filled the place with all colours. And now Mossy saw that there was a pillar beside the red one, which he had not observed before. And it was of the same new colour that he had seen in the rainbow when he saw it first in the fairy forest. And on it he saw a sparkle of blue. It was the sapphires round the key-hole.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1007'>He took his key. It turned in the lock to the sound of Aeolian music. A door opened upon slow hinges, and disclosed a winding stair within. The key vanished from his fingers. Tangle went up. Mossy followed. The door closed behind them. They climbed out of the earth; and, still climbing, rose above it. They were in the rainbow. Far abroad, over ocean and land, they could see through its transparent walls the earth beneath their feet. Stairs beside stairs wound up together, and beautiful beings of all ages climbed along with them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1008'>They knew that they were going up to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shadow' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;whence;know;fall' valence='5.73666666667' arousal='3.76333333333' dominance='5.2'>the country</entity> whence the shadows fall.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1009'>And by this time I think they must have got there.</paragraph>

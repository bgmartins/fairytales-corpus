It waalcfor a most powerful charm, the object  being two-fold : firstly, to make a donkey play the pianoforte,  and secondly, to cure a school-boy of putting his hands in his  pockets and wearing out his trousers at the knees ; so you can  fancy Merlin had to take a good deal of trouble, having to achieve  such a difScult thing. At the end of the two-hundred-and-ninety   fifth mile he found the herb he wanted. It was called ^^ sttcke,\"\"  or by others  " cudd\"obllb,\"\" and Merlin had always found it  useftd both for donkeys and school-boys. In fact, since the time  of the great enchanter, schoolmasters have found it so handy  that they have been in the habit of keeping a variety of this  herb, called \"\" kayne,\"\" constantly in use in their establishments.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>u"Merlin, however, saw that something was weighing heavily on  the spirits of his entertainers; and questioned them concerning  the cause of their grief.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='83'>u"Tom waSj as I have told you^ as big as his father"s thumb;  and he never grew any bigger^ so that the ploughman sometimes  wished he had merely asked for a son without saying anything  at all about his thumb ; or that Merlin had not granted his wish  so exactly to the letter. For he feared such a little fellow as his  son would never be able to defend himself against the attacks  of the rude boys in the village^ who would^ he thought^ take  advantage of their superior size to illtreat and annoy little Tom,  or as his father expressed it to ^" punch "un.^" But the plough-  man need have been under no fear as to the punching process ;  for what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='^;plough;man;fear;punching;process;strength;quality;match;urchin;place' adjectives='cunning;latter;whole' verbs='have;be;lack;make;make'>Tonmiy</entity> lacked in strength he made up for in cunning,  and this latter quality made him a match for any urchin in the  whole place.

But the boys saved him all trouble in the matter, by refusing  to play with him any more at all. And so may every little boy  be served who cheats at marbles  say I.</paragraph>

She could scarcely be-  lieve her eyes^ and at last fancied the pudding must be bewitched^  and accordingly determined to give it away to the first person  who came by^ and who cared to take it off her hands. You  will think this was not very generous of the good woman to part  with what she did not care to keep in the house j but I know a  good many boys and girls who want to be thought liberal  merely because they give away the plaything they are tired of,  or the old broken doll with one eye which has been lying about  in the lumber room for months.

But the cow, in cropping up the thistles, hap-  pened to choose the very one to which our little friend was tied,  and all at once he found himself in a great red cavern with two  rows of white pillars going ""champ  champ P" all round him  in a very alarming manner. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fright;top;voice;lus;mother' adjectives='little' verbs='begin;cry;see;be;roar'>Tom</entity> began to cry out with fright  when he saw where he was, and roared at the top of his little  voice, for lus mother.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='118'>u"Master Tom was rather a forward boy for his age^ and still  more so for his size; and he soon thought he ought to have  some employment by which he might make himself useful.  I believe, he wanted to be put to ploughing or threshings or  some light labour of that kind; but his fetther^ though he ad-  mired the boy"s spirit^ did not care to bring him on quite so  &amp;st. To indulge the little man^ however^ his father told him  he should be driver^ and he made him a whip of a barley-straw  to drive along the plough horse. Tom thought this very grand^  and used to halloo at the horses^ and crack his whip in a most  valiant manner; but as he could never strike higher than the  horse"s hoof^ it is doubtful whether he was really of much use..  One day^ however, as he stood upon a dod of earth to aim a  mighty blow at one of the horses, his foot slipped, and he rolled  over and over into a fuiMw. A raven, hoYering near, picked  up the barley-straw whip and little Tommy together. Up through  the air the poor little man was whisked, so swiftly that it took  his breath away; but luckily the raven stopped to rest on the  terrace of a castle belonging to the giant Orumbo; and here  the raven dropped Tom, who was, as you may suppose, very  glad to be set down, and very much  flurried by the speed at  which he had been compelled to travd.

So he opened his mouth and swallowed Tom down. Poor Tom  was in a worse plight than ever; for if he had compelled the  fish to set him free^ as the giant had done^ he would only have  been shot out into the sea and must have perished by drowning;  so his only chance was to wait patiently in hope that the fish  might be caught. And it was not long before this happened;  for the fish was a greedy kind of fellow, always in search of  something to eat, and never satisfied; and so one day he snapped  up a bait hanging at the end of a fishing line, though if he had  been less eager )ie might easily have seen the hook peeping  through. And that makes me think how many greedy children  have enjoyed themselves like this at Christmas parties, and never  thought of the hook that peeped through what they ate, in the  shape of headache and sickness next day, and the doctor, and  rhubarb powders, and the feeling of having acted like a piggy.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='344'>This Btory cannot boast the high antiquity wliich investamany of our  nursery legends with additional interest. The adventure of SUverhair  with the three bears is evidently a tale of modem origin. But though  we cannot make a guess at the author\"s name, we think the source  whence he has derived the idea of the child\"s visit to the bear\"s domicile  is manifest enough. In the old Oerman story " Schneeweisschen," or  \"\" Schneewittchen," so pleasingly told in the collection of the Brothers  Grimm, and in Bechstein\"s delightful \"* Marchenbuch," and translated  into our own language under the title of " Snowdrop," the heroine of  the tale, persecuted by a wicked queen takes refuge in a little house in  the wood, inhabited by seven dwarfs. The owners are absent on her  arrival, and she behaves herself somewhat in the style of Silverhair ; but  she distributes her favors more equally, eating out of all the seven  plates, drinking from each of the seven mugs, &amp;c. The dwarfs come  home, and one says, \"\" Who has been eating from my plate ?" Another,  " Who has been picking at my bread ? " A third, " Who has been  cutting with my knife P " &amp;c. ; and finally, the intruder is found asleep  on the seventh dwarfs bed, like Silverhair on the couch of the little  bear. It is this idea, we doubt not, that has been worked out by the  gifted but anonymous author of " The Three Bears," who has merely  altered the characters, in deference, perhaps, to English juvenile taste,  which delights in the adventurers of animals, while in German nurseries  dwarfs, brownies, and cluricaunes, under the general names of "Zwerge"  and " Kobolde," are greater favourites than even the brute creation.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='355'>One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw at a dis-  tance a great cloud of dust which seemed to approach him. It  proved to be a large body of horse ; and thinking that they might  be thieves, for there had been much talk of a large body of fierce  mounted marauders who had been pillaging the country round  that neighbourhood, he climbed a large thick tree from whence  he could see all that passed without being seen. This tree stood  at the foot of a very high rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='356'>The troop, who were all well mounted and armed, came to  the foot of the rock, and there dismounted. Ali Baba counted  forty of them. By their mien and equipment he never doubted  but that they were thieves, and in this opinion he was not mis-  taken, for they were the very thieves of whose daring exploits so  much had been said, and who were supposed to possess a strong-  hold in the forest. Every man unbridled his horse, tied him to  some shrub, and hxmg a bag of com about his neck. Then each  of them took his portmanteau, which seemed to Ali Baba by  the weight to contain gold and silver, and followed oue who  appeared to be their captain. This man came under the tree in  which Ali Baba was hid ; and pronounced distinctly the words   " Sesame, open." Hereupon a door opened in the rock. After  the captain had made all his troop go in, he followed them him-  self, and the door shut again.</paragraph>

The captain made  an apology for the trouble he was giving, and accepted the invita-  tion. Ali Baba not only bore him company, but entertained him  with many things to divert him until the hour for retiring to  rest had arrived. Morgiana, who had been very busy during the  evening, had still some work to do after the household had retired.  Finding the oil in her lamp exhausted, and having none handy,  she bethought her of the merchant\"s oil in the court-yard, and  ran out with her lamp to fill it firom one of the jars; when  she came to the first jar, the thief within said softly  ^\"\"Is it  time ? " Though very much astonished, she answered, " Not yet,**  and went in the same manner to the other jars, giving the same  answer, until she came to the jar of oil. She was now aware that  her master was watched by foes, and determined to save him from  them. She placed a great kettle upon the fire, filled it with oil  fix&gt;m the ftdl jar, and as soon as it boiled she went and poured  enough into every jar to stifle and destroy the thief within. As  soon as this was accomplished, she heard the captain giving a  signal to his band by throwing stones at the jars. Receiving  no answer he descended to the court-yard, and looking into the  jars discovered what had happened. Enraged, and in despair at  being foiled in his design, he forced the lock of the garden door  vnd made his escape.</paragraph>

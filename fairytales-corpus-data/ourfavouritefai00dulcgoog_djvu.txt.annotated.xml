	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='60'>Well, one day this great Merlin was on a journey. He had  walked two himdred and ninety-five miles in search of a certain  herb he wanted. It waalcfor a most powerful charm, the object  being two-fold : firstly, to make a donkey play the pianoforte,  and secondly, to cure a school-boy of putting his hands in his  pockets and wearing out his trousers at the knees ; so you can  fancy Merlin had to take a good deal of trouble, having to achieve  such a difScult thing. At the end of the two-hundred-and-ninety   fifth mile he found the herb he wanted. It was called ^^ sttcke,""  or by others  " cudd"obllb,"" and Merlin had always found it  useftd both for donkeys and school-boys. In fact, since the time  of the great enchanter, schoolmasters have found it so handy  that they have been in the habit of keeping a variety of this  herb, called "" kayne,"" constantly in use in their establishments.

The best bread and the freshest bowl of milk were  placed at his service ; and the good woman, in particulaTj seemed  most anxious to do honor to her guest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>Merlin, however, saw that something was weighing heavily on  the spirits of his entertainers; and questioned them concerning  the cause of their grief.

For he feared such a little fellow as his  son would never be able to defend himself against the attacks  of the rude boys in the village^ who would^ he thought^ take  advantage of their superior size to illtreat and annoy little Tom,  or as his father expressed it to ^" punch "un.^" But the plough-  man need have been under no fear as to the punching process ;  for what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='strength;urchin;process;plough;place;punching;fear;^;quality;match;man' adjectives='latter;whole;cunning' verbs='be;make;lack;have' valence='5.47176470588' arousal='3.97058823529' dominance='5.76588235294'>Tonmiy</entity> lacked in strength he made up for in cunning,  and this latter quality made him a match for any urchin in the  whole place.</paragraph>

But the boys saved him all trouble in the matter, by refusing  to play with him any more at all. And so may every little boy  be served who cheats at marbles  say I.</paragraph>

Greatly surprised was the good woman^ I can tell you^  when she beheld the pudding bobbing up and down in the pot^  ^dancing a sort of hornpipe all by itself. She could scarcely be-  lieve her eyes^ and at last fancied the pudding must be bewitched^  and accordingly determined to give it away to the first person  who came by^ and who cared to take it off her hands. You  will think this was not very generous of the good woman to part  with what she did not care to keep in the house j but I know a  good many boys and girls who want to be thought liberal  merely because they give away the plaything they are tired of,  or the old broken doll with one eye which has been lying about  in the lumber room for months.

The tinker  had not gone iar before he felt a fmmy sort of motion  " bump   bump  bump!" in his wallet. At first he thought a rat must  have got in there, and opened his bag to see. But, to his horror,  be heard a voice from inside the pudding crying out most  distinctly " Hullo  I say  you let me ou-n-ut t  ^You let me  o-u-tl" and the pudding began to kick and dance in a most  alarming manner.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='110'>A short time after^ Tom went with his mother to milk the  cow; that is to say, his mother was to milk the cow, and Tom  to make remarks and observations upon the subject. As it was  a very windy day, his mother very prudently tied her little son  to a thistle with a bit of thread, for fear he should be blown  over and over. But the cow, in cropping up the thistles, hap-  pened to choose the very one to which our little friend was tied,  and all at once he found himself in a great red cavern with two  rows of white pillars going ""champ  champ P" all round him  in a very alarming manner. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='top;voice;lus;fright;mother' adjectives='little' verbs='roar;be;begin;cry;see' valence='5.457' arousal='4.357' dominance='5.204'>Tom</entity> began to cry out with fright  when he saw where he was, and roared at the top of his little  voice, for lus mother.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='118'>Master Tom was rather a forward boy for his age^ and still  more so for his size; and he soon thought he ought to have  some employment by which he might make himself useful.  I believe, he wanted to be put to ploughing or threshings or  some light labour of that kind; but his fetther^ though he ad-  mired the boy"s spirit^ did not care to bring him on quite so  &amp;st. To indulge the little man^ however^ his father told him  he should be driver^ and he made him a whip of a barley-straw  to drive along the plough horse. Tom thought this very grand^  and used to halloo at the horses^ and crack his whip in a most  valiant manner; but as he could never strike higher than the  horse"s hoof^ it is doubtful whether he was really of much use..  One day^ however, as he stood upon a dod of earth to aim a  mighty blow at one of the horses, his foot slipped, and he rolled  over and over into a fuiMw. A raven, hoYering near, picked  up the barley-straw whip and little Tommy together. Up through  the air the poor little man was whisked, so swiftly that it took  his breath away; but luckily the raven stopped to rest on the  terrace of a castle belonging to the giant Orumbo; and here  the raven dropped Tom, who was, as you may suppose, very  glad to be set down, and very much  flurried by the speed at  which he had been compelled to travd.

The midddle-sized bear had a middle-sized  porridge pot, and a chair and bed to match. For the little bear  there was such a nice^ttle chair, and a neat little bed, and  a little porridge pot that held just enough to fill the little  bear"s little stomach.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='344'>This Btory cannot boast the high antiquity wliich investamany of our  nursery legends with additional interest. The adventure of SUverhair  with the three bears is evidently a tale of modem origin. But though  we cannot make a guess at the author"s name, we think the source  whence he has derived the idea of the child"s visit to the bear"s domicile  is manifest enough. In the old Oerman story " Schneeweisschen," or  "" Schneewittchen," so pleasingly told in the collection of the Brothers  Grimm, and in Bechstein"s delightful "* Marchenbuch," and translated  into our own language under the title of " Snowdrop," the heroine of  the tale, persecuted by a wicked queen takes refuge in a little house in  the wood, inhabited by seven dwarfs. The owners are absent on her  arrival, and she behaves herself somewhat in the style of Silverhair ; but  she distributes her favors more equally, eating out of all the seven  plates, drinking from each of the seven mugs, &amp;c. The dwarfs come  home, and one says, "" Who has been eating from my plate ?" Another,  " Who has been picking at my bread ? " A third, " Who has been  cutting with my knife P " &amp;c. ; and finally, the intruder is found asleep  on the seventh dwarfs bed, like Silverhair on the couch of the little  bear. It is this idea, we doubt not, that has been worked out by the  gifted but anonymous author of " The Three Bears," who has merely  altered the characters, in deference, perhaps, to English juvenile taste,  which delights in the adventurers of animals, while in German nurseries  dwarfs, brownies, and cluricaunes, under the general names of "Zwerge"  and " Kobolde," are greater favourites than even the brute creation.</paragraph>

This decided  the thief at once ; by strong persuasion, and the promise of two  gold pieces, Baba Mustapha consented to have his eyes bound and  endeavour to remember the road he had formerly traversed under  similar circumstances. He rose from his seat, led the thief to  the spot where Morgiana had bound his eyes, and where the thief  did so likewise ; when blindfold, Mustapha said, " This was the  way I turned,"* and followed by the thief he proceeded with great  deliberation until he arrived directly opposite Cassim"s house;  "" I went no further than here,*" said he.

Exasperated at their present  fidlure, they demanded the forfeited life of their baffled comrade ;  and he was accordingly executed. Another of the gang came  forward and undertook the same task, on the same conditions.  He went to Baba Mustapha, bribed him as the other had done,  and marked the door with red chalk in a place which, as he ima  gined, was remote from sight.

Finding the oil in her lamp exhausted, and having none handy,  she bethought her of the merchant"s oil in the court-yard, and  ran out with her lamp to fill it firom one of the jars; when  she came to the first jar, the thief within said softly  ^""Is it  time ? " Though very much astonished, she answered, " Not yet,**  and went in the same manner to the other jars, giving the same  answer, until she came to the jar of oil. She was now aware that  her master was watched by foes, and determined to save him from  them. She placed a great kettle upon the fire, filled it with oil  fix&gt;m the ftdl jar, and as soon as it boiled she went and poured  enough into every jar to stifle and destroy the thief within. As  soon as this was accomplished, she heard the captain giving a  signal to his band by throwing stones at the jars. Receiving  no answer he descended to the court-yard, and looking into the  jars discovered what had happened. Enraged, and in despair at  being foiled in his design, he forced the lock of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='vnd;door;lock;despair;design;escape' adjectives='enraged;foiled' verbs='be;make;force' valence='5.192' arousal='4.071' dominance='5.197'>the garden</entity> door  vnd made his escape.</paragraph>

One day he met some foresters, and they made a bet with  him that he could not shoot a deer which was standing at a  very great distance; he did it, but they refused to pay their  bet, so he was offended and left them, and when he was a  little way off they laughed at him, which made him very angry,  so in the heat of passion he turned round and shot at them  with his arrows until he had killed them all. Almost before  he was a man he had spent all his fortune and got deeply  in debt by keeping three hundred bowmen to be his companions  in his sports, and so many were the pranks he played, and so  great were his debts, that the abbot of a monastery close by  became his enemy and caused him to be outlawed. He then  went and lived in the woods and killed the king"s deer for  food. Some other young men, who were wild like himself, went  with him, others joined them, and in a few years there was  about one hundred of them, with Bobin for their captain.

His extraction was noble, and his true name IIobsbt Fitzooth, which  vulgar pronunciation easily corrupted into BoBiy Hoon. He is fre-  quently styled, and commonly reputed to have been, Eabl of Huktino-  noK ; a title to which, in the latter part of his life at least, he actually  appears to have had some sort of pretension. In his vouth he is re-  ported to have been of a wild and extravagant disposition, insomuch  that his inheritance being consumed or forfeited by his excesses, and his  person outlawed for debt, either from necessity or choice he sought an  asylum in the woods and forests, with which immense tracts, especially  in the northern parts of the kingdom, were at that time covered. Of  these he chiefly affected Bamsdale, in Yorkshire ; Sherwood, in Not-  tinghamshire ; and, according to some, Plumpton-park, in Cumberland.  Here he either found, or was afterwards joined by, a number of persons  in similar circumstances, who appear to have considered and obeyed  him as their chief or leader, and of whom his principal favorites, or  those in whose courage and fidelity he most confided, were Little Johit  (whose surname is said to have been JNailor), William Scablock  (Scathelock, or Scarlet), George a Green, pinder (or pound-keeper),  of Wakefield, Much, a miller"s son, and a certain monk or frier, named  Tuck. He is likevrise said to have been accompanied in his retreat by  a female; of whom he was enamoured, and whose real or adopted name  was IVIariak.</paragraph>

At length,  the infirmities of old age increasing upon him, and desirous to be re-  lieved, in a fit of sickness, by being let blood, he applied for that pur-  pose to the prioress of Kirkleys-nunnery in Yorkshire, his rela&amp;on,  (women, and particularly religious women, being, in those times, some-  what better skilled in surgery than the sex is at present), by whom he was  treacherously suffered to bleed to death.

The ass is very well as far as  he goes, but the difficulty is to find out how to make him go far  enough.

And to tell you the truths I was very  glad the cat served out the two brothers in this way^ for bb they  had left the Marquis of Carabas quite alone in his poverty^ they  decidedly had no right to expect they should come in for a share  of his wealth. However^ he returned good for evil^ as a good  brother should do^ and gave each of them a large piece of very  fine land to cultivate. They established farms^ and in due time  became wealthy men. But they always regretted that they had  not taken a little more notice of their younger brother in the  days when he sat disconsolate, without knowing how he should  set about getting his living; and the two young men felt that  they did not deserve the kindness they received at his hands,  which was rather an impleasant reflection.</paragraph>

So that, at last, no party  was considered complete if he did not grace it by his presence  and his talents and talons, (for you will perceive this cat had  natural talents as well as natural talons). With children he  was especially a favorite, and has even been known to allow them  to stroke his fur the wrong way to see the electric spark.

In the old and most unsatiBfiBustory version, the chronicle ends  at the exciting point where the wolf sprang upon Little Bed Eiding  Hood and ate her up in a moment. In the next version, we arrive  at a somewhat more satisfactory result ; the wolf is killed, and thus at  least the death of the ill-fated heroine of the tale is avenged. But still  it seemed a hard thing that the poor little child should suffer death  merely for a piece of amiable indiscretion, and accordingly the German  tale of ""Bothkappcher"* seeks to evade this difficulty by making  the wolf swallow both grandmother and child wholly and thus enabling  them to be freed from their unpleasant position on the cutting open  of the wolf by the huntsman. The conclusion of the Gferman tale is  in the same "whimsical strain. The huntsmen finding the wolf asleep^  Bobstitute two great stones for the grandmother and grandchild, with-  out disturbing the monster"s nap ; the wolf goes to drink at the stream,  and tumbling in, is borne down by the weight of the stones. This  version appeared too extravagant to present to English children even  as a fiury tale. It has been therefore thought advisable to retain  the old English version of the story, merely altering the condusion  to avoid killing the heroine.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1136'>Years went on, and Cinderella became prettier, and her  step-sisters more unkind than ever. They were never weary  of tormenting the poor girl; and had not even the sense to  see that every one disliked them for it. They would dress  themselves out in great state to go to balls and parties, and  were not ashamed to ask Cinderella to help them to dress.  Then, when she had taken the greatest pains with them, these  unkind girls would say some harsh word or other to her, as  they went down stairs. And I wish every one who reads this  story, (especially every little girl), to reflect what harm is  sometimes done by unkind words, hastily uttered. Never allow  yourselves to be harsh in your speech, and even give up the  last word rather than disregard this piece of good advice.</paragraph>

They found plenty of work for  Cinderella, who after her household drudgery was done, had to  starch, iron, trim, sew, and cut out for them, in a most remark-  able way ; and when she had done her very best, tliey scolded  her for her trouble. But when the day of the ball really came,  then was indeed a tims of hurry-skurry, and hurly-burly.  263</paragraph>

He had a splendid hooee and large varehouses full  of costly goods; and a hundred guests bowed themBelves before  him, and sat down at his table every day. As his wealth in-  creased, so did the number of his firiends; and at last it was  difficult to tell which was the greater  ^the wealth of the mer-  chant, or the amount of praise and flattery bestowed upon him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1243'>The merchant"s family consisted of tlu-ee sons and three  daughters. The sons were tall, well-grown, young men, with  honest hearts and open countenances, and the daughters were  all handsome, dark-eyed ladies. But, as it frequently happens,  the chief gifts of loveliness and grace had been bestowed upon  the youD^cst of them all; and so bright and happy was her  291</paragraph>

One of his  largest ships, with a very costly cargo, was miserably wrecked  on the high seas, and only two of the sailors were saved, after  clinging for days to the fragment of a mast. Another equally  valuable vessel was taken by pirates; and a third fell into the  hands of the enemy"s fleet. By land he was equally unfortu-  nate; his largest warehouse was burnt, and the Bedouins  attacked and plundered a caravan conveying his goods across the  desert.

I am sorry to say, the two sisters had quite  counted on being asked this question, and were ready with a long  list of things they wanted, chiefly fine dresses and jewels ; and  their requests somewhat astonished the merchant, who promised,  however, they should have what they wanted. Beauty had not  been thinking about herself all this while, and did not know what  to reply, as she had no wish for anything in particular; so, in  order not to disappoint her father"s kind intention, she begged  him to bring her a full-blown rose, as there were none in their  garden. The elder sisters laughed at Beauty in secret for what  they called her stupid choice; but they did not dare to show  their spite openly for fear of their brothers. So the merchant  rode off on a horse he had borrowed from a Mend, and the daugh-  ters stood at the door waving their handkerchiefs and crying  " Good-bye !

But at last she made up her mind to ask Mr. Smith to teach  her when he had a moment to spare. This he readily agreed  to do ; and little Margery used to leam of him an hour every  evening. This was aU the time the good man could spare for  her.</paragraph>

She walked contentedly along one field and across another;  at one tune wending her way along the high road, at another  taking a short cut along a shady lane, where the tall trees waved  on each side, and the scent of the flowering thorn lingered in  the quiet evening. But the evening was not so cool as one might  have expected. There was a dose stifling feeling in the air;  and the cattle, as they were driven along the road^ tossed up  their heads and appeared to be gasping for breath* Little Goody  Two-shoes thought there must be a storm coming on; and  she wais right. For a moment there was a rustle among the  trees, as if they were whispering to each other; then it grew  darker and darker, and all was quiet. Goody Two-shoes was  far too sensible a little girl to be afiraid of the dark and of  ghosts. She knew that the stories people told of their appear-  ing at night and in lonely places, were nothing but idle tales,  and that those who believed such tales were as foolish as those  who told them. But she knew that if she did not make haste  she should be wetted to the skin. So Goody Two-shoes gathered  her ekirts closer about her, and took to her heels and ran.  Presently she saw an old bam by the way-side; it belonged  to a farm which stood empty, for the feimer who owned it  had died only a few weeks before; but a few trasses of straw  had been left in the bam till the family should have time to  remove them; and upon one of these trusses little Goody sat  down, quite tired and out of breath with her nm, just as the</paragraph>

Now it would have been rather difBcult for any other  person to have got to the sqitire so late in the evening. Bat  the servants all knew Margery, and loved her for her kind  heart and ready obliging ways; so the fat butler sent at once  to the squire, as he sat at dinner with his friends, and told him  that little Two-shoes wanted very much to see him on a matter  of great importance.

The squire saw there was not a moment to lose;  he went back and told his friends the news he had heard. They  all determined to stay and help hinir take the thieves. The lights  were put out at the usual hour, so that the robbers might fancy  all the people of the house were in bed, and several of the ser-  vants hid themselves behind trees in front of the house, to pounce  upon the thieves when they came. Sure enough, at about one  o"clock in the morning, the three men came creeping creeping   up to the house, with a dark lantern, and a basket of tools to  break open doors with. But every one was quite ready for them;  and before they were aware, six men sprang upon them and held  them fast. The thieves struggled in vain to get away. They  were bound tightly and lodged in an outhouse till next morning,  when a cart came to take them to gaol. I hear they were after-  wards sent out of the coimtry, a long way off across the sea,  to a country where they had to work in chains on the roads,  and to go through many hardships. One of them, I have heard,  reformed his ways, and was so industrious, and behaved himself  so well, that he received a pardon, and lived in Australia, where  he died a rich man.

But he soon got tired  of doing so, especially as he happened to be very hungry ; and sat  down to take his frugal supper. This time the giant had the  whole of a salted hog for his supper, besides three large salted  cod-fishes, which he ate as a moderate man might eat herrings.  This salt fare made him rather thirsty, so he drank three great  oesks of strong beer, whereas his usual custom was to wash down  his supper with only two.

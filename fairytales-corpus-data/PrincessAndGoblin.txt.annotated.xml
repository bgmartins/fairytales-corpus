	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='18'>There was once a little princess whose father was king over a great country full of mountains and valleys.  His palace was built upon one of the mountains, and was very grand and beautiful.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='farmhouse;name;people;house;half;mother;half-way;mountain;base;peak;birth;country;castle;side' adjectives='large;strong' verbs='be;send;bear;bring' valence='6.24958333333' arousal='4.04625' dominance='5.65208333333'>The princess</entity>, whose name was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='farmhouse;name;people;house;half;mother;half-way;mountain;base;peak;birth;country;castle;side' adjectives='large;strong' verbs='be;send;bear;bring' valence='6.24958333333' arousal='4.04625' dominance='5.65208333333'>Irene</entity>, was born there, but she was sent soon after her birth, because her mother was not very strong, to be brought up by country people in a large house, half castle, half farmhouse, on the side of another mountain, about half-way between its base and its peak.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='19'>The princess was a sweet little creature, and at the time my story begins was about eight years old, I think, but she got older very fast. Her face was fair and pretty, with eyes like two bits of night sky, each with a star dissolved in the blue.  Those eyes you would have thought must have known they came from there, so often were they turned up in that direction.  The ceiling of her nursery was blue, with stars in it, as like the sky as they could make it. But I doubt if ever she saw the real sky with the stars in it, for a reason which I had better mention at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>These mountains were full of hollow places underneath; huge caverns, and winding ways, some with water running through them, and some shining with all colours of the rainbow when a light was taken in. There would not have been much known about them, had there not been mines there, great deep pits, with long galleries and passages running off from them, which had been dug to get at the ore of which the mountains were full.  In the course of digging, the miners came upon many of these natural caverns.  A few of them had far-off openings out on the side of a mountain, or into a ravine.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='21'>Now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings, called by some gnomes, by some kobolds, by some goblins.  There was a legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground, and were very like other people.  But for some reason or other, concerning which there were different legendary theories, the king had laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them, or had required observances of them they did not like, or had begun to treat them with more severity, in some way or other, and impose stricter laws; and the consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the country.  According to the legend, however, instead of going to some other country, they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns, whence they never came out but at night, and then seldom showed themselves in any numbers, and never to many people at once.  It was only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains that they were said to gather even at night in the open air.  Those who had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in the course of generations; and no wonder, seeing they lived away from the sun, in cold and wet and dark places.  They were now, not ordinarily ugly, but either absolutely hideous, or ludicrously grotesque both in face and form.  There was no invention, they said, of the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil, that could surpass the extravagance of their appearance.  But I suspect those who said so had mistaken some of their animal companions for the goblins themselves--of which more by and by.  The goblins themselves were not so far removed from the human as such a description would imply.  And as they grew misshapen in body they had grown in knowledge and cleverness, and now were able to do things no mortal could see the possibility of.  But as they grew in cunning, they grew in mischief, and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy the people who lived in the open-air storey above them.  They had enough of affection left for each other to preserve them from being absolutely cruel for cruelty"s sake to those that came in their way; but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those who occupied their former possessions and especially against the descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion, that they sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as their inventors; and although dwarfed and misshapen, they had strength equal to their cunning.  In the process of time they had got a king and a government of their own, whose chief business, beyond their own simple affairs, was to devise trouble for their neighbours.  It will now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at night.  They were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='reason;company;goblin;attendant' adjectives='many;good;afraid' verbs='be;see;let;have' valence='5.67916666667' arousal='3.68916666667' dominance='5.395'>the house</entity> then, even in company with ever so many attendants; and they had good reason, as we shall see by and by.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='24'>The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='herself' adjectives='' verbs='lose' valence='5.615' arousal='5.425' dominance='5.065'>Princess</entity> Loses Herself</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='25'>I have said the Princess Irene was about eight years old when my story begins.  And this is how it begins.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='26'>One very wet day, when the mountain was covered with mist which was constantly gathering itself together into raindrops, and pouring down on the roofs of the great old house, whence it fell in a fringe of water from the eaves all round about it, the princess could not of course go out.  She got very tired, so tired that even her toys could no longer amuse her.  You would wonder at that if I had time to describe to you one half of the toys she had.  But then, you wouldn"t have the toys themselves, and that makes all the difference: you can"t get tired of a thing before you have it.  It was a picture, though, worth seeing--the princess sitting in the nursery with the sky ceiling over her head, at a great table covered with her toys.  If the artist would like to draw this, I should advise him not to meddle with the toys.  I am afraid of attempting to describe them, and I think he had better not try to draw them.  He had better not.  He can do a thousand things I can"t, but I don"t think he could draw those toys.  No man could better make the princess herself than he could, though--leaning with her back bowed into the back of the chair, her head hanging down, and her hands in her lap, very miserable as she would say herself, not even knowing what she would like, except it were to go out and get thoroughly wet, and catch a particularly nice cold, and have to go to bed and take gruel.  The next moment after you see her sitting there, her nurse goes out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='moment;nurse' adjectives='next' verbs='go;see;sit' valence='5.91166666667' arousal='3.95666666667' dominance='5.78'>the room</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='27'>Even that is a change, and the princess wakes up a little, and looks about her.  Then she tumbles off her chair and runs out of the door, not the same door the nurse went out of, but one which opened at the foot of a curious old stair of worm-eaten oak, which looked as if never anyone had set foot upon it.  She had once before been up six steps, and that was sufficient reason, in such a day, for trying to find out what was at the top of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='28'>Up and up she ran--such a long way it seemed to her!--until she came to the top of the third flight.  There she found the landing was the end of a long passage.  Into this she ran.  It was full of doors on each side.  There were so many that she did not care to open any, but ran on to the end, where she turned into another passage, also full of doors. When she had turned twice more, and still saw doors and only doors about her, she began to get frightened.  It was so silent!  And all those doors must hide rooms with nobody in them!  That was dreadful. Also the rain made a great trampling noise on the roof.  She turned and started at full speed, her little footsteps echoing through the sounds of the rain--back for the stairs and her safe nursery.  So she thought, but she had lost herself long ago.  It doesn"t follow that she was lost, because she had lost herself, though.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='29'>She ran for some distance, turned several times, and then began to be afraid.  Very soon she was sure that she had lost the way back. Rooms everywhere, and no stair!  Her little heart beat as fast as her little feet ran, and a lump of tears was growing in her throat. But she was too eager and perhaps too frightened to cry for some time.  At last her hope failed her.  Nothing but passages and doors everywhere!  She threw herself on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sob;cry;burst' adjectives='' verbs='break;throw;wail' valence='4.1575' arousal='4.86875' dominance='4.42625'>the floor</entity>, and burst into a wailing cry broken by sobs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='30'>She did not cry long, however, for she was as brave as could be expected of a princess of her age.  After a good cry, she got up, and brushed the dust from her frock.  Oh, what old dust it was! Then she wiped her eyes with her hands, for princesses don"t always have their handkerchiefs in their pockets, any more than some other little girls I know of.  Next, like a true princess, she resolved on going wisely to work to find her way back: she would walk through the passages, and look in every direction for the stair. This she did, but without success.  She went over the same ground again an again without knowing it, for the passages and doors were all alike.  At last, in a corner, through a half-open door, she did see a stair.  But alas! it went the wrong way: instead of going down, it went up.  Frightened as she was, however, she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair could lead.  It was very narrow, and so steep that she went on like a four-legged creature on her hands and feet.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='33'>The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='see;shall' adjectives='' verbs='' valence='6.59' arousal='4.28' dominance='5.87666666667'>Princess</entity> and--We Shall See Who</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='34'>When she came to the top, she found herself in a little square place, with three doors, two opposite each other, and one opposite the top of the stair.  She stood for a moment, without an idea in her little head what to do next.  But as she stood, she began to hear a curious humming sound.  Could it be the rain?  No.  It was much more gentle, and even monotonous than the sound of the rain, which now she scarcely heard. The low sweet humming sound went on, sometimes stopping for a little while and then beginning again.  It was more like the hum of a very happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower, than anything else I can think of at this moment.  Where could it come from?  She laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was there--then to another.  When she laid her ear against the third door, there could be no doubt where it came from: it must be from something in that room.  What could it be?  She was rather afraid, but her curiosity was stronger than her fear, and she opened the door very gently and peeped in.  What do you think she saw?  A very old lady who sat spinning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='35'>Perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady was an old lady, when I inform you that not only was she beautiful, but her skin was smooth and white.  I will tell you more.  Her hair was combed back from her forehead and face, and hung loose far down and all over her back.  That is not much like an old lady--is it?  Ah! but it was white almost as snow.  And although her face was so smooth, her eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be old.  The princess, though she could not have told you why, did think her very old indeed--quite fifty, she said to herself.  But she was rather older than that, as you shall hear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='36'>While <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wheel;head;hum;hers;voice;lady' adjectives='shaky;sweet;bewildered;old' verbs='stare;say;lift;mingle;continue' valence='5.37470588235' arousal='4.27529411765' dominance='5.59176470588'>the princess</entity> stared bewildered, with her head just inside <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wheel;head;hum;hers;voice;lady' adjectives='shaky;sweet;bewildered;old' verbs='stare;say;lift;mingle;continue' valence='5.37470588235' arousal='4.27529411765' dominance='5.59176470588'>the door</entity>, the old lady lifted hers, and said, in a sweet, but old and rather shaky voice, which mingled very pleasantly with the continued hum of her wheel:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='37'>"Come in, my dear; come in.  I am glad to see you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='38'>That the princess was a real princess you might see now quite plainly; for she didn"t hang on to the handle of the door, and stare without moving, as I have known some do who ought to have been princesses but were only rather vulgar little girls.  She did as she was told, stepped inside <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='shut;do;step;tell;be' valence='5.41166666667' arousal='3.61333333333' dominance='5.75'>the door</entity> at once, and shut it gently behind her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='39'>"Come to me, my dear," said the old lady.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='40'>And again the princess did as she was told.  She approached the old lady--rather slowly, I confess--but did not stop until she stood by her side, and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted stars in them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='41'>"Why, what have you been doing with your eyes, child?" asked the old lady.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='42'>"Crying," answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='answer;cry' valence='5.65333333333' arousal='4.95666666667' dominance='4.75'>the princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>"Why, child?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='44'>"Because I couldn"t find my way down again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>"But you could find your way up."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='46'>"Not at first--not for a long time."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='47'>"But your face is streaked like the back of a zebra.  Hadn"t you a handkerchief to wipe your eyes with?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='48'>"No."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>"Then why didn"t you come to me to wipe them for you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='50'>"Please, I didn"t know you were here.  I will next time."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>"There"s a good child!" said the old lady.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='52'>Then she stopped her wheel, and rose, and, going out of the room, returned with a little silver basin and a soft white towel, with which she washed and wiped the bright little face.  And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hand' adjectives='smooth;nice' verbs='be;think' valence='6.64166666667' arousal='3.88' dominance='6.0'>the princess</entity> thought her hands were so smooth and nice!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='53'>When she carried away the basin and towel, the little princess wondered to see how straight and tall she was, for, although she was so old, she didn"t stoop a bit.  She was dressed in black velvet with thick white heavy-looking lace about it; and on the black dress her hair shone like silver.  There was hardly any more furniture in the room than there might have been in that of the poorest old woman who made her bread by her spinning.  There was no carpet on the floor--no table anywhere--nothing but the spinning-wheel and the chair beside it.  When she came back, she sat down and without a word began her spinning once more, while Irene, who had never seen a spinning-wheel, stood by her side and looked on.  When the old lady had got her thread fairly going again, she said to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lady;thread' adjectives='old' verbs='go;say;look;have;get' valence='5.93' arousal='4.22888888889' dominance='5.64333333333'>the princess</entity>, but without looking at her:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='54'>"Do you know my name, child?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='55'>"No, I don"t know it," answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='t' adjectives='' verbs='answer;don;know' valence='6.112' arousal='4.532' dominance='5.494'>the princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='56'>"My name is <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='name' adjectives='' verbs='be' valence='5.9' arousal='3.235' dominance='5.32'>Irene</entity>."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>"I know that.  I let you have mine.  I haven"t got your name. You"ve got mine."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>"How can that be?" asked the princess, bewildered.  "I"ve always had my name."</paragraph>

I let you have it with pleasure."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='61'>"It was very kind of you to give me your name--and such a pretty one," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kind;name' adjectives='' verbs='be;say;give' valence='6.465' arousal='4.225' dominance='5.886'>the princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>"Oh, not so very kind!" said the old lady.  "A name is one of those things one can give away and keep all the same.  I have a good many such things.  Wouldn"t you like to know who I am, child?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>"Yes, that I should--very much."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='64'>"I"m your great-great-grandmother," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='great-great-grandmother;m' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='5.705' arousal='4.62' dominance='5.6875'>the lady</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>"What"s that?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='6.795' arousal='4.45' dominance='6.015'>the princess</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='69'>"Oh, no!" answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='answer' valence='6.87' arousal='4.71' dominance='5.845'>the princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>"I will explain it all to you when you are older," the lady went on. "But you will be able to understand this much now: I came here to take care of you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>"Is it long since you came?  Was it yesterday?  Or was it today, because it was so wet that I couldn"t get out?"</paragraph>

The princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens, but instead of that, she saw the blue sky first, and then the roofs of the house, with a multitude of the loveliest pigeons, mostly white, but of all colours, walking about, making bows to each other, and talking a language she could not understand.  She clapped her hands with delight, and up rose such a flapping of wings that she in her turn was startled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>"You"ve frightened my poultry," said the old lady, smiling.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>"I see," said the princess.  "The pigeons feed themselves.  They"ve got wings."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>"But how do you get at the eggs?  Where are their nests?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='112'>The lady took hold of a little loop of string in the wall at the side of the door and, lifting a shutter, showed a great many pigeon-holes with nests, some with young ones and some with eggs in them.  The birds came in at the other side, and she took out the eggs on this side.  She closed it again quickly, lest the young ones should be frightened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>"Oh, what a nice way!" cried the princess.  "Will you give me an egg to eat?  I"m rather hungry."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='156'>The princess wiped her eyes, and her face grew so hot that they were soon quite dry.  She sat down to her dinner, but ate next to nothing. Not to be believed does not at all agree with princesses: for a real princess cannot tell a lie.  So all the afternoon she did not speak a word.  Only when the nurse spoke to her, she answered her, for a real princess is never rude--even when she does well to be offended.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='157'>Of course the nurse was not comfortable in her mind--not that she suspected the least truth in Irene"s story, but that she loved her dearly, and was vexed with herself for having been cross to her. She thought her crossness was the cause of the princess"s unhappiness, and had no idea that she was really and deeply hurt at not being believed. But, as it became more and more plain during the evening in her every motion and look, that, although she tried to amuse herself with her toys, her heart was too vexed and troubled to enjoy them, her nurse"s discomfort grew and grew.  When bedtime came, she undressed and laid her down, but the child, instead of holding up her little mouth to be kissed, turned away from her and lay still.  Then nursie"s heart gave way altogether, and she began to cry.  At the sound of her first sob the princess turned again, and held her face to kiss her as usual.

Indeed, this day was so like the last that it would have been difficult to tell where was the use of It.  The first thing she thought of, however, was not the rain, but the lady in the tower; and the first question that occupied her thoughts was whether she should not ask the nurse to fulfil her promise this very morning, and go with her to find her grandmother as soon as she had had her breakfast.  But she came to the conclusion that perhaps the lady would not be pleased if she took anyone to see her without first asking leave; especially as it was pretty evident, seeing she lived on pigeons" eggs, and cooked them herself, that she did not want the household to know she was there.  So the princess resolved to take the first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might bring her nurse.

Of course she could refuse to take her, but then she would believe her less than ever.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='188'>Now the nurse, as she said herself afterwards, could not be every moment in the room; and as never before yesterday had the princess given her the smallest reason for anxiety, it had not yet come into her head to watch her more closely.

My own suspicion is that she had not gone up high enough, and was searching on the second instead of the third floor. When she turned to go back, she failed equally in her search after the stair.  She was lost once more.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='190'>Something made it even worse to bear this time, and it was no wonder that she cried again.  Suddenly it occurred to her that it was after having cried before that she had found her grandmother"s stair.  She got up at once, wiped her eyes, and started upon a fresh quest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='191'>This time, although she did not find what she hoped, she found what was next best: she did not come on a stair that went up, but she came upon one that went down.  It was evidently not the stair she had come up, yet it was a good deal better than none; so down she went, and was singing merrily before she reached the bottom. There, to her surprise, she found herself in the kitchen.  Although she was not allowed to go there alone, her nurse had often taken her, and she was a great favourite with the servants.  So there was a general rush at her the moment she appeared, for every one wanted to have her; and the report of where she was soon reached the nurse"s ears.  She came at once to fetch her; but she never suspected how she had got there, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='counsel' adjectives='own' verbs='get;keep;suspect;have;come;fetch' valence='5.5925' arousal='3.88625' dominance='5.34625'>the princess</entity> kept her own counsel.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='192'>Her failure to find the old lady not only disappointed her, but made her very thoughtful.  Sometimes she came almost to the nurse"s opinion that she had dreamed all about her; but that fancy never lasted very long.

The princess was very fond of being out of doors, and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather was no better.  But the mist was not of such a dark dingy grey; there was light in it; and as the hours went on it grew brighter and brighter, until it was almost too brilliant to look at; and late in the afternoon the sun broke out so gloriously that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='light;mist;hand;sun' adjectives='dark;dingy;brilliant;grey;brighter' verbs='be;look;cry;break;go;grow;clap' valence='5.669' arousal='4.2025' dominance='5.2875'>Irene</entity> clapped her hands, crying:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='198'>Lootie was very glad to please the princess.  She got her hat and cloak, and they set out together for a walk up the mountain; for the road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it, and it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain ceased.  The clouds were rolling away in broken pieces, like great, overwoolly sheep, whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost too white for the eyes to bear.  Between them the sky shone with a deeper and purer blue, because of the rain.  The trees on the roadside were hung all over with drops, which sparkled in the sun like jewels. The only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that ran down the mountain; they had changed from the clearness of crystal to a muddy brown; but what they lost in colour they gained in sound--or at least in noise, for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as before.

So on and on they did go, now to look at a group of ferns over whose tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch, now to pick a shining stone from a rock by the wayside, now to watch the flight of some bird.

Before, however, she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like her, she heard the sound of whistling, and that revived her.  Presently she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them.  He was the whistler; but before they met his whistling changed to singing. And this is something like what he sang:</paragraph>

She did not want to open a new cause of strife with the princess by saying more plainly what she meant.  Glad enough that she had succeeded both in getting home unseen, and in keeping the princess from kissing the miner"s boy, she resolved to watch her far better in future.  Her carelessness had already doubled the danger she was in.  Formerly the goblins were her only fear; now she had to protect her charge from <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fear;goblin;charge' adjectives='only' verbs='be;protect;have' valence='4.92833333333' arousal='4.29' dominance='4.89666666667'>Curdie</entity> as well.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>Curdie went home whistling.  He resolved to say nothing about the princess for fear of getting the nurse into trouble, for while he enjoyed teasing her because of her absurdity, he was careful not to do her any harm.  He saw no more of the goblins, and was soon fast asleep in his bed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='311'>He woke in the middle of the night, and thought he heard curious noises outside.  He sat up and listened; then got up, and, opening the door very quietly, went out.  When he peeped round the corner, he saw, under his own window, a group of stumpy creatures, whom he at once recognized by their shape.  Hardly, however, had he begun his "One, two, three!" when they broke asunder, scurried away, and were out of sight.  He returned laughing, got into bed again, and was fast asleep in a moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='312'>Reflecting a little over the matter in the morning, he came to the conclusion that, as nothing of the kind had ever happened before, they must be annoyed with him for interfering to protect the princess.  By the time he was dressed, however, he was thinking of something quite different, for he did not value the enmity of the goblins in the least. As soon as they had had breakfast, he set off with his father for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='breakfast;father' adjectives='' verbs='set;have' valence='6.244' arousal='3.764' dominance='5.854'>the mine</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='313'>They entered the hill by a natural opening under a huge rock, where a little stream rushed out.  They followed its course for a few yards, when the passage took a turn, and sloped steeply into the heart of the hill.  With many angles and windings and branchings-off, and sometimes with steps where it came upon a natural gulf, it led them deep into the hill before they arrived at the place where they were at present digging out the precious ore. This was of various kinds, for the mountain was very rich in the better sorts of metals.  With flint and steel, and tinder-box, they lighted their lamps, then fixed them on their heads, and were soon hard at work with their pickaxes and shovels and hammers.  Father and son were at work near each other, but not in the same gang--the passages out of which the ore was dug, they called gangs--for when the lode, or vein of ore, was small, one miner would have to dig away alone in a passage no bigger than gave him just room to work--sometimes in uncomfortable cramped positions.  If they stopped for a moment they could hear everywhere around them, some nearer, some farther off, the sounds of their companions burrowing away in all directions in the inside of the great mountain--some boring holes in the rock in order to blow it up with gunpowder, others shovelling the broken ore into baskets to be carried to the mouth of the mine, others hitting away with their pickaxes. Sometimes, if the miner was in a very lonely part, he would hear only a tap-tapping, no louder than that of a woodpecker, for the sound would come from a great distance off through the solid mountain rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='314'>The work was hard at best, for it is very warm underground; but it was not particularly unpleasant, and some of the miners, when they wanted to earn a little more money for a particular purpose, would stop behind the rest and work all night.  But you could not tell night from day down there, except from feeling tired and sleepy; for no light of the sun ever came into those gloomy regions.  Some who had thus remained behind during the night, although certain there were none of their companions at work, would declare the next morning that they heard, every time they halted for a moment to take breath, a tap-tapping all about them, as if the mountain were then more full of miners than ever it was during the day; and some in consequence would never stay overnight, for all knew those were the sounds of the goblins.  They worked only at night, for the miners" night was the goblins" day. Indeed, the greater number of the miners were afraid of the goblins; for there were strange stories well known amongst them of the treatment some had received whom the goblins had surprised at their work during the night.  The more courageous of them, however, amongst them Peter Peterson and Curdie, who in this took after his father, had stayed in the mine all night again and again, and although they had several times encountered a few stray goblins, had never yet failed in driving them away.  As I have indicated already, the chief defence against them was verse, for they hated verse of every kind, and some kinds they could not endure at all.  I suspect they could not make any themselves, and that was why they disliked it so much.  At all events, those who were most afraid of them were those who could neither make verses themselves nor remember the verses that other people made for them; while those who were never afraid were those who could make verses for themselves; for although there were certain old rhymes which were very effectual, yet it was well known that a new rhyme, if of the right sort, was even more distasteful to them, and therefore more effectual in putting them to flight.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='330'>For some time Curdie worked away briskly, throwing all the ore he had disengaged on one side behind him, to be ready for carrying out in the morning.  He heard a good deal of goblin-tapping, but it all sounded far away in the hill, and he paid it little heed.  Towards midnight he began to feel rather hungry; so he dropped his pickaxe, got out a lump of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock, sat down on a heap of ore, and ate his supper. Then he leaned back for five minutes" rest before beginning his work again, and laid his head against the rock.  He had not kept the position for one minute before he heard something which made him sharpen his ears.  It sounded like a voice inside the rock. After a while he heard it again.  It was a goblin voice--there could be no doubt about that--and this time he could make out the words.</paragraph>

You see it back there--a long way.  Still, perhaps, in case of accident it would be as well to be getting out of this. Helfer, you"ll take the great chest.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>He now knew at least one of the reasons for the constant sound of the goblin hammers and pickaxes at night.  They were making new houses for themselves, to which they might retreat when the miners should threaten to break into their dwellings.  But he had learned two things of far greater importance.  The first was, that some grievous calamity was preparing, and almost ready to fall upon the heads of the miners; the second was--the one weak point of a goblin"s body; he had not known that their feet were so tender as he had now reason to suspect.  He had heard it said that they had no toes: he had never had opportunity of inspecting them closely enough, in the dusk in which they always appeared, to satisfy himself whether it was a correct report.  Indeed, he had not been able even to satisfy himself as to whether they had no fingers, although that also was commonly said to be the fact.  One of the miners, indeed, who had had more schooling than the rest, was wont to argue that such must have been the primordial condition of humanity, and that education and handicraft had developed both toes and fingers--with which proposition Curdie had once heard his father sarcastically agree, alleging in support of it the probability that babies" gloves were a traditional remnant of the old state of things; while the stockings of all ages, no regard being paid in them to the toes, pointed in the same direction.  But what was of importance was the fact concerning the softness of the goblin feet, which he foresaw might be useful to all miners.  What he had to do in the meantime, however, was to discover, if possible, the special evil design the goblins had now in their heads.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='387'>Although he knew all the gangs and all the natural galleries with which they communicated in the mined part of the mountain, he had not the least idea where the palace of the king of the gnomes was; otherwise he would have set out at once on the enterprise of discovering what the said design was.  He judged, and rightly, that it must lie in a farther part of the mountain, between which and the mine there was as yet no communication.  There must be one nearly completed, however; for it could be but a thin partition which now separated them.  If only he could get through in time to follow the goblins as they retreated!  A few blows would doubtless be sufficient--just where his ear now lay; but if he attempted to strike there with his pickaxe, he would only hasten the departure of the family, put them on their guard, and perhaps lose their involuntary guidance.  He therefore began to feel <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;noise;hand' adjectives='enough;little' verbs='feel;be;begin;find;draw' valence='5.605' arousal='3.77166666667' dominance='5.6975'>the wall</entity> With his hands, and soon found that some of the stones were loose enough to be drawn out with little noise.</paragraph>

He was slowly making it bigger, for here the rock had been very much shattered with the blasting.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='404'>There seemed to be a good many in the family, to judge from the mass of confused talk which now and then came through the hole; but when all were speaking together, and just as if they had bottle-brushes--each at least one--in their throats, it was not easy to make out much that was said.  At length he heard once more what the father goblin was saying.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='405'>"Now, then," he said, "get your bundles on your backs.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='408'>Curdie could hardly keep himself from calling through to know whether they made the fire to light their torches by.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='412'>A sound of many soft feet followed, but soon ceased.  Then Curdie flew at the hole like a tiger, and tore and pulled.  The sides gave way, and it was soon large enough for him to crawl through.  He would not betray himself by rekindling his lamp, but the torches of the retreating company, which he found departing in a straight line up a long avenue from the door of their cave, threw back light enough to afford him a glance round the deserted home of the goblins.  To his surprise, he could discover nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary natural cave in the rock, upon many of which he had come with the rest of the miners in the progress of their excavations.  The goblins had talked of coming back for the rest of their household gear: he saw nothing that would have made him suspect a family had taken shelter there for a single night.  The floor was rough and stony; the walls full of projecting corners; the roof in one place twenty feet high, in another endangering his forehead; while on one side a stream, no thicker than a needle, it is true, but still sufficient to spread a wide dampness over the wall, flowed down the face of the rock.  But the troop in front of him was toiling under heavy burdens.  He could distinguish Helfer now and then, in the flickering light and shade, with his heavy chest on his bending shoulders; while the second brother was almost buried in what looked like a great feather bed.  "Where do they get the feathers?" thought Curdie; but in a moment the troop disappeared at a turn of the way, and it was now both safe and necessary for Curdie to follow them, lest they should be round the next turning before he saw them again, for so he might lose them altogether.  He darted after them like a greyhound. When he reached the corner and looked cautiously round, he saw them again at some distance down another long passage.  None of the galleries he saw that night bore signs of the work of man--or of goblin either.  Stalactites, far older than the mines, hung from their roofs; and their floors were rough with boulders and large round stones, showing that there water must have once run.  He waited again at this corner till they had disappeared round the next, and so followed them a long way through one passage after another.  The passages grew more and more lofty, and were more and more covered in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stalactite;passage' adjectives='more;lofty' verbs='shine;be;cover;grow' valence='5.7' arousal='3.34' dominance='5.89142857143'>the roof</entity> with shining stalactites.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='413'>It was a strange enough procession which he followed.  But the strangest part of it was the household animals which crowded amongst the feet of the goblins.  It was true they had no wild animals down there--at least they did not know of any; but they had a wonderful number of tame ones.  I must, however, reserve any contributions towards the natural history of these for a later position in my story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='414'>At length, turning a corner too abruptly, he had almost rushed into the middle of the goblin family; for there they had already set down all their burdens on the floor of a cave considerably larger than that which they had left.  They were as yet too breathless to speak, else he would have had warning of their arrest.  He started back, however, before anyone saw him, and retreating a good way, stood watching till the father should come out to go to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='anyone;father;way' adjectives='good' verbs='watch;start;see;stand;go;come;retreat' valence='5.74692307692' arousal='3.88538461538' dominance='5.43153846154'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='415'>Before very long, both he and his son Helfer appeared and kept on in the same direction as before, while Curdie followed them again with renewed precaution.  For a long time he heard no sound except something like the rush of a river inside the rock; but at length what seemed the far-off noise of a great shouting reached his ears, which, however, presently ceased.  After advancing a good way farther, he thought he heard a single voice.  It sounded clearer and clearer as he went on, until at last he could almost distinguish the words.  In a moment or two, keeping after the goblins round another corner, he once more started back--this time in amazement.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='416'>He was at the entrance of a magnificent cavern, of an oval shape, once probably a huge natural reservoir of water, now the great palace hall of the goblins.  It rose to a tremendous height, but the roof was composed of such shining materials, and the multitude of torches carried by the goblins who crowded the floor lighted up the place so brilliantly, that Curdie could see to the top quite well.  But he had no idea how immense the place was until his eyes had got accustomed to it, which was not for a good many minutes. The rough projections on the walls, and the shadows thrown upwards from them by the torches, made the sides of the chamber look as if they were crowded with statues upon brackets and pedestals, reaching in irregular tiers from floor to roof. The walls themselves were, in many parts, of gloriously shining substances, some of them gorgeously coloured besides, which powerfully contrasted with the shadows.  Curdie could not help wondering whether his rhymes would be of any use against such a multitude of goblins as filled the floor of the hall, and indeed felt considerably tempted to begin his shout of "One, two, three!", but as there was no reason for routing them and much for endeavouring to discover their designs, he kept himself perfectly quiet, and peering round the edge of the doorway, listened with both his sharp ears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='417'>At the other end of the hall, high above the heads of the multitude, was a terrace-like ledge of considerable height, caused by the receding of the upper part of the cavern-wall.  Upon this sat the king and his court: the king on a throne hollowed out of a huge block of green copper ore, and his court upon lower seats around it.  The king had been making them a speech, and the applause which followed it was what Curdie had heard.  One of the court was now addressing the multitude. What he heard him say was to the following effect: "Hence it appears that two plans have been for some time together working in the strong head of His Majesty for the deliverance of his people.  Regardless of the fact that we were the first possessors of the regions they now inhabit; regardless equally of the fact that we abandoned that region from the loftiest motives; regardless also of the self-evident fact that we excel them so far in mental ability as they excel us in stature, they look upon us as a degraded race and make a mockery of all our finer feelings.  But, the time has almost arrived when--thanks to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='power;revenge;behaviour;genius;s;thanks;time;respect' adjectives='unfriendly;inventive;thorough' verbs='be;arrive;take;have' valence='5.67941176471' arousal='4.44941176471' dominance='6.02529411765'>His Majesty</entity>"s inventive genius--it will be in our power to take a thorough revenge upon them once for all, in respect of their unfriendly behaviour."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='426'>"This very evening I have had to remove my household effects; therefore the sooner we are ready to carry out the plan, for the execution of which His Majesty has been making such magnificent preparations, the better.

This discovery will, I trust, add considerably to the otherwise immense forces at His Majesty"s disposal."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='427'>He ceased, and the king graciously acknowledged his speech with a bend of his head; whereupon Glump, after a bow to His Majesty, slid down amongst the rest of the undistinguished multitude.  Then the Chancellor rose and resumed.</paragraph>

Should His Majesty be successful--as who dares to doubt?--then a peace, all to the advantage of the goblin kingdom, will be established for a generation at least, rendered absolutely secure by the pledge which His Royal Highness the prince will have and hold for the good behaviour of her relatives.  Should His Majesty fail--which who shall dare even to imagine in his most secret thoughts?--then will be the time for carrying out with rigour the design to which Glump referred, and for which our preparations are even now all but completed.  The failure of the former will render the latter imperative."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='430'>There was not much danger of meeting any goblins, for all the men at least were left behind him in the palace; but there was considerable danger of his taking a wrong turning, for he had now no light, and had therefore to depend upon his memory and his hands.  After he had left behind him the glow that issued from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='abode;s;eye;guide;glow' adjectives='new' verbs='leave;be;issue;have;concern' valence='5.64615384615' arousal='3.92692307692' dominance='5.43923076923'>the door</entity> of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='abode;s;eye;guide;glow' adjectives='new' verbs='leave;be;issue;have;concern' valence='5.64615384615' arousal='3.92692307692' dominance='5.43923076923'>Glump</entity>"s new abode, he was utterly without guide, so far as his eyes were concerned.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='431'>He was most anxious to get back through the hole before the goblins should return to fetch the remains of their furniture.  It was not that he was in the least afraid of them, but, as it was of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly discover what the plans they were cherishing were, he must not occasion the slightest suspicion that they were watched by a miner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='432'>He hurried on, feeling his way along the walls of rock.  Had he not been very courageous, he must have been very anxious, for he could not but know that if he lost his way it would be the most difficult thing in the world to find it again.  Morning would bring no light into these regions; and towards him least of all, who was known as a special rhymester and persecutor, could goblins be expected to exercise courtesy.  Well might he wish that he had brought his lamp and tinder-box with him, of which he had not thought when he crept so eagerly after the goblins!  He wished it all the more when, after a while, he found his way blocked up, and could get no farther.  It was of no use to turn back, for he had not the least idea where he had begun to go wrong.  Mechanically, however, he kept feeling about the walls that hemmed him in.  His hand came upon a place where a tiny stream of water was running down the face of the rock.  "What a stupid I am!" he said to himself.  "I am actually at the end of my journey! And there are the goblins coming back to fetch their things!" he added, as the red glimmer of their torches appeared at the end of the long avenue that led up to the cave.  In a moment he had thrown himself on the floor, and wriggled backwards through the hole.  The floor on the other side was several feet lower, which made it easier to get back. It was all he could do to lift the largest stone he had taken out of the hole, but he did manage to shove it in again.  He sat down on the ore-heap and thought.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='433'>He was pretty sure that the latter plan of the goblins was to inundate the mine by breaking outlets for the water accumulated in the natural reservoirs of the mountain, as well as running through portions of it. While the part hollowed by the miners remained shut off from that inhabited by the goblins, they had had no opportunity of injuring them thus; but now that a passage was broken through, and the goblins" part proved the higher in the mountain, it was clear to Curdie that the mine could be destroyed in an hour.  Water was always the chief danger to which the miners were exposed.  They met with a little choke-damp sometimes, but never with the explosive firedamp so common in coal-mines.  Hence they were careful as soon as they saw any appearance of water. As the result of his reflections while the goblins were busy in their old home, it seemed to Curdie that it would be best to build up the whole of this gang, filling it with stone, and clay or lie, so that there should be no smallest channel for the water to get into. There was not, however, any immediate danger, for the execution of the goblins" plan was contingent upon the failure of that unknown design which was to take precedence of it; and he was most anxious to keep the door of communication open, that he might if possible discover what the former plan was.  At the same time they could not resume their intermitted labours for the inundation without his finding it out; when by putting all hands to the work, the one existing outlet might in a single night be rendered impenetrable to any weight of water; for by filling the gang entirely up, their embankment would be buttressed by the sides of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='weight;inundation;work;hand;water;labour;outlet;embankment;time;side;gang' adjectives='single;intermitted;impenetrable;same' verbs='be;buttress;render;resume;exist;put;find;fill' valence='5.44375' arousal='3.93291666667' dominance='5.62916666667'>the mountain</entity> itself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='434'>As soon as he found that the goblins had again retired, he lighted his lamp, and proceeded to fill the hole he had made with such stones as he could withdraw when he pleased.  He then thought it better, as he might have occasion to be up a good many nights after this, to go home and have some sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='435'>How pleasant the night air felt upon the outside of the mountain after what he had gone through in the inside of it!  He hurried up the hill without meeting a single goblin on the way, and called and tapped at the window until he woke his father, who soon rose and let him in.  He told him the whole story; and, just as he had expected, his father thought it best to work that lode no farther, but at the same time to pretend occasionally to be at work there still in order that the goblins might have no suspicions.  Both father and son then went to bed and slept soundly until the morning.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='439'>The weather continued fine for weeks, and the little princess went out every day.  So long a period of fine weather had indeed never been known upon that mountain.  The only uncomfortable thing was that her nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside; and many an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the weather-cock on the stables.  If it had not been for such odd behaviour Irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins.  She never forgot <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sake;debt;princess' adjectives='own' verbs='be;pay;forget;have;remember' valence='5.37583333333' arousal='4.14083333333' dominance='5.2275'>Curdie</entity>, but him she remembered for his own sake, and indeed would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her debts until they are paid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='440'>One splendid sunshiny day, about an hour after noon, Irene, who was playing on a lawn in the garden, heard the distant blast of a bugle. She jumped up with a cry of joy, for she knew by that particular blast that her father was on his way to see her.  This part of the garden lay on the slope of the hill and allowed a full view of the country below. So she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked far away to catch the first glimpse of shining armour.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='441'>On and on they came until she could clearly distinguish the king. He rode a white horse and was taller than any of the men with him. He wore a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet, and as he came still nearer Irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the sun.  It was a long time since he had been to see her, and her little heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached, for she loved her king-papa very dearly and was nowhere so happy as in his arms.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='442'>By this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate, but Irene stood alone in front of them.

In an instant she was on the saddle and clasped in his great strong arms.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='443'>I wish I could describe the king so that you could see him in your mind.  He had gentle, blue eyes, but a nose that made him look like an eagle.

Then the king set her on the ground and, dismounting, took her hand and walked with her into the great hall, which was hardly ever entered except when he came to see his little princess.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='474'>Nothing more happened worth telling for some time.  The autumn came and went by.  There were no more flowers in the garden.  The wind blew strong, and howled among the rocks.  The rain fell, and drenched the few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches. Again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring afternoon, and sometimes, for a week together, there would be rain, nothing but rain, all day, and then the most lovely cloudless night, with the sky all out in full-blown stars--not one missing.  But the princess could not see much of them, for she went to bed early.  The winter drew on, and she found things growing dreary.  When it was too stormy to go out, and she had got tired of her toys, Lootie would take her about the house, sometimes to the housekeeper"s room, where the housekeeper, who was a good, kind old woman, made much of her--sometimes to the servants" hall or the kitchen, where she was not princess merely, but absolute queen, and ran a great risk of being spoiled. Sometimes she would run off herself to the room where the men-at-arms whom the king had left sat, and they showed her their arms and accoutrements and did what they could to amuse her.  Still at times she found it very dreary, and often and often wished that her huge great grandmother had not been a dream.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='475'>One morning the nurse left her with the housekeeper for a while. To amuse her she turned out the contents of an old cabinet upon the table. The little princess found her treasures, queer ancient ornaments, and many things the use of which she could not imagine, far more interesting than her own toys, and sat playing with them for two hours or more.  But, at length, in handling a curious old-fashioned brooch, she ran the pin of it into her thumb, and gave a little scream with the sharpness of the pain, but would have thought little more of it had not the pain increased and her thumb begun to swell.  This alarmed the housekeeper greatly.  The nurse was fetched; the doctor was sent for; her hand was poulticed, and long before her usual time she was put to bed.  The pain still continued, and although she fell asleep and dreamed a good many dreams, there was the pain always in every dream. At last it woke her UP.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='476'>The moon was shining brightly into the room.  The poultice had fallen off her hand and it was burning hot.  She fancied if she could hold it into the moonlight that would cool it.  So she got out of bed, without waking the nurse who lay at the other end of the room, and went to the window.  When she looked out she saw one of the men-at-arms walking in the garden with the moonlight glancing on his armour.  She was just going to tap on the window and call him, for she wanted to tell him all about it, when she bethought herself that that might wake Lootie, and she would put her into her bed again.  So she resolved to go to the window of another room, and call him from there.  It was so much nicer to have somebody to talk to than to lie awake in bed with the burning pain in her hand.  She opened the door very gently and went through the nursery, which did not look into the garden, to go to the other window. But when she came to the foot of the old staircase there was the moon shining down from some window high up, and making the worm-eaten oak look very strange and delicate and lovely.  In a moment she was putting her little feet one after the other in the silvery path up the stair, looking behind as she went, to see the shadow they made in the middle of the silver.  Some little girls would have been afraid to find themselves thus alone in the middle of the night, but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='middle;girl;princess' adjectives='little;afraid' verbs='be;find;have' valence='5.71384615385' arousal='4.08461538462' dominance='5.20230769231'>Irene</entity> was a princess.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='477'>As she went slowly up the stair, not quite sure that she was not dreaming, suddenly a great longing woke up in her heart to try once more whether she could not find the old lady with the silvery hair. "If she is a dream," she said to herself, "then I am the likelier to find her, if I am dreaming."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='478'>So up and up she went, stair after stair, until she Came to the many rooms--all just as she had seen them before.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='480'>When she reached the top she stood a moment listening in the dark, for there was no moon there.  Yes! it was! it was the hum of the spinning-wheel!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='501'>It was indeed very pretty stuff.  There was a good bunch of it on the distaff attached to the spinning-wheel, and in the moonlight it shone like--what shall I say it was like?  It was not white enough for silver--yes, it was like silver, but shone grey rather than white, and glittered only a little.  And the thread the old lady drew out from it was so fine that Irene could hardly see it. "I am spinning this for you, my child."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>"I will tell you by and by.  But first I will tell you what it is. It is spider-web--of a particular kind.  My pigeons bring it me from over the great sea.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='509'>The old lady rose, and left her wheel standing just as it was.  You see there was no good in putting it away, for where there was not any furniture there was no danger of being untidy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='510'>Then she took Irene by the hand, but it was her bad hand and Irene gave a little cry of pain.  "My child!" said her grandmother, "what is the matter?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='511'>Irene held her hand into the moonlight, that the old lady might see it, and told her all about it, at which she looked grave.  But she only said: "Give me your other hand"; and, having led her out upon the little dark landing, opened the door on the opposite side of it.  What was Irene"s surprise to see the loveliest room she had ever seen in her life!  It was large and lofty, and dome-shaped. From the centre hung a lamp as round as a ball, shining as if with the brightest moonlight, which made everything visible in the room, though not so clearly that the princess could tell what many of the things were.  A large oval bed stood in the middle, with a coverlid of rose colour, and velvet curtains all round it of a lovely pale blue.  The walls were also blue--spangled all over with what looked like stars of silver.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='512'>The old lady left her and, going to a strange-looking cabinet, opened it and took out a curious silver casket.  Then she sat down on a low chair and, calling Irene, made her kneel before her while she looked at her hand.  Having examined it, she opened the casket, and took from it a little ointment.  The sweetest odour filled the room--like that of roses and lilies--as she rubbed the ointment gently all over the hot swollen hand.  Her touch was so pleasant and cool that it seemed to drive away the pain and heat wherever it came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='513'>"Oh, grandmother! it is so nice!" said Irene.  "Thank you; thank you."</paragraph>

She made and kept a little heaven in that poor cottage on the high hillside for her husband and son to go home to out of the low and rather dreary earth in which they worked.  I doubt if the princess was very much happier even in the arms of her huge great-grandmother than Peter and Curdie were in the arms of Mrs. Peterson.  True, her hands were hard and chapped and large, but it was with work for them; and therefore, in the sight of the angels, her hands were so much the more beautiful.  And if Curdie worked hard to get her a petticoat, she worked hard every day to get him comforts which he would have missed much more than she would a new petticoat even in winter.  Not that she and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everything' adjectives='much;other' verbs='spoil;work;think;have' valence='5.30333333333' arousal='3.89833333333' dominance='5.67333333333'>Curdie</entity> ever thought of how much they worked for each other: that would have spoiled everything.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='545'>When left alone in the mine Curdie always worked on for an hour or two at first, following the lode which, according to Glump, would lead at last into the deserted habitation.  After that, he would set out on a reconnoitring expedition.  In order to manage this, or rather the return from it, better than the first time, he had bought a huge ball of fine string, having learned the trick from Hop-o"-my-Thumb, whose history his mother had often told him.  Not that Hop-o"-my-Thumb had ever used a ball of string--I should be sorry to be supposed so far out in my classics--but the principle was the same as that of the pebbles. The end of this string he fastened to his pickaxe, which figured no bad anchor, and then, with the ball in his hand, unrolling it as he went, set out in the dark through the natural gangs of the goblins" territory.  The first night or two he came upon nothing worth remembering; saw only a little of the home-life of the cobs in the various caves they called houses; failed in coming upon anything to cast light upon the foregoing design which kept the inundation for the present in the background.  But at length, I think on the third or fourth night, he found, partly guided by the noise of their implements, a company of evidently the best sappers and miners amongst them, hard at work.  What were they about?  It could not well be the inundation, seeing that had in the meantime been postponed to something else.  Then what was it?  He lurked and watched, every now and then in the greatest risk of being detected, but without success.  He had again and again to retreat in haste, a proceeding rendered the more difficult that he had to gather up his string as he returned upon its course.  It was not that he was afraid of the goblins, but that he was afraid of their finding out that they were watched, which might have prevented the discovery at which he aimed.  Sometimes his haste had to be such that, when he reached home towards morning, his string, for lack of time to wind it up as he "dodged the cobs", would be in what seemed most hopeless entanglement; but after a good sleep, though a short one, he always found his mother had got it right again.  There it was, wound in a most respectable ball, ready for use the moment he should want it!</paragraph>

But still he had made no discovery as to what the goblin miners were about.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='551'>About this time the gentlemen whom the king had left behind him to watch over the princess had each occasion to doubt the testimony of his own eyes, for more than strange were the objects to which they would bear witness.  They were of one sort--creatures--but so grotesque and misshapen as to be more like a child"s drawings upon his slate than anything natural.  They saw them only at night, while on guard about the house.  The testimony of the man who first reported having seen one of them was that, as he was walking slowly round the house, while yet in the shadow, he caught sight of a creature standing on its hind legs in the moonlight, with its forefeet upon a window-ledge, staring in at the window.  Its body might have been that of a dog or wolf, he thought, but he declared on his honour that its head was twice the size it ought to have been for the size of its body, and as round as a ball, while the face, which it turned upon him as it fled, was more like one carved by a boy upon the turnip inside which he is going to put a candle than anything else he could think of.  It rushed into the garden. He sent an arrow after it, and thought he must have struck it; for it gave an unearthly howl, and he could not find his arrow any more than the beast, although he searched all about the place where it vanished.  They laughed at him until he was driven to hold his tongue, and said he must have taken too long a pull at the ale-jug.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='552'>But before two nights were over he had one to side with him, for he, too, had seen something strange, only quite different from that reported by the other.  The description the second man gave of the creature he had seen was yet more grotesque and unlikely.  They were both laughed at by the rest; but night after night another came over to their side, until at last there was only one left to laugh at all his companions.  Two nights more passed, and he saw nothing; but on the third he came rushing from the garden to the other two before the house, in such an agitation that they declared--for it was their turn now--that the band of his helmet was cracking under his chin with the rising of his hair inside it. Running with him into that part of the garden which I have already described, they saw a score of creatures, to not one of which they could give a name, and not one of which was like another, hideous and ludicrous at once, gambolling on the lawn in the moonlight. The supernatural or rather subnatural ugliness of their faces, the length of legs and necks in some, the apparent absence of both or either in others, made the spectators, although in one consent as to what they saw, yet doubtful, as I have said, of the evidence of their own eyes--and ears as well; for the noises they made, although not loud, were as uncouth and varied as their forms, and could be described neither as grunts nor squeaks nor roars nor howls nor barks nor yells nor screams nor croaks nor hisses nor mews nor shrieks, but only as something like all of them mingled in one horrible dissonance. Keeping in the shade, the watchers had a few moments to recover themselves before the hideous assembly suspected their presence; but all at once, as if by common consent, they scampered off in the direction of a great rock, and vanished before the men had come to themselves sufficiently to think of following them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='553'>My readers will suspect what these were; but I will now give them full information concerning them.  They were, of course, household animals belonging to the goblins, whose ancestors had taken their ancestors many centuries before from the upper regions of light into the lower regions of darkness.  The original stocks of these horrible creatures were very much the same as the animals now seen about farms and homes in the country, with the exception of a few of them, which had been wild creatures, such as foxes, and indeed wolves and small bears, which the goblins, from their proclivity towards the animal creation, had caught when cubs and tamed.  But in the course of time all had undergone even greater changes than had passed upon their owners.  They had altered--that is, their descendants had altered--into such creatures as I have not attempted to describe except in the vaguest manner--the various parts of their bodies assuming, in an apparently arbitrary and self-willed manner, the most abnormal developments. Indeed, so little did any distinct type predominate in some of the bewildering results, that you could only have guessed at any known animal as the original, and even then, what likeness remained would be more one of general expression than of definable conformation.  But what increased the gruesomeness tenfold was that, from constant domestic, or indeed rather family association with the goblins, their countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='554'>No one understands animals who does not see that every one of them, even amongst the fishes, it may be with a dimness and vagueness infinitely remote, yet shadows the human: in the case of these the human resemblance had greatly increased: while their owners had sunk towards them, they had risen towards their owners.  But the conditions of subterranean life being equally unnatural for both, while the goblins were worse, the creatures had not improved by the approximation, and its result would have appeared far more ludicrous than consoling to the warmest lover of animal nature.  I shall now explain how it was that just then these animals began to show themselves about <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='country;s;animal;house' adjectives='' verbs='be;explain;begin;show' valence='6.01727272727' arousal='4.02818181818' dominance='5.74272727273'>the king</entity>"s country house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='555'>The goblins, as Curdie had discovered, were mining on--at work both day and night, in divisions, urging the scheme after which he lay in wait. In the course of their tunnelling they had broken into the channel of a small stream, but the break being in the top of it, no water had escaped to interfere with their work.  Some of the creatures, hovering as they often did about their masters, had found the hole, and had, with the curiosity which had grown to a passion from the restraints of their unnatural circumstances, proceeded to explore the channel.  The stream was the same which ran out by the seat on which Irene and her king-papa had sat as I have told, and the goblin creatures found it jolly fun to get out for a romp on a smooth lawn such as they had never seen in all their poor miserable lives.  But although they had partaken enough of the nature of their owners to delight in annoying and alarming any of the people whom they met on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='people;nature;course;design;owner;master' adjectives='own;alarming;annoying;incapable' verbs='be;partake;delight;have;further;meet' valence='5.73785714286' arousal='4.34857142857' dominance='5.30428571429'>the mountain</entity>, they were, of course, incapable of designs of their own, or of intentionally furthering those of their masters.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='556'>For several nights after the men-at-arms were at length of one mind as to the fact of the visits of some horrible creatures, whether bodily or spectral they could not yet say, they watched with special attention that part of the garden where they had last seen them.  Perhaps indeed they gave in consequence too little attention to the house.  But the creatures were too cunning to be easily caught; nor were the watchers quick-eyed enough to descry the head, or the keen eyes in it, which, from the opening whence <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;eye;moment;watcher;turn;whence;place;creature' adjectives='ready;quick-eyed;clear;keen;cunning' verbs='be;open;watch;leave;report;descry;catch;issue' valence='5.80434782609' arousal='3.85086956522' dominance='5.75217391304'>the stream</entity> issued, would watch them in turn, ready, the moment they should leave <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;eye;moment;watcher;turn;whence;place;creature' adjectives='ready;quick-eyed;clear;keen;cunning' verbs='be;open;watch;leave;report;descry;catch;issue' valence='5.80434782609' arousal='3.85086956522' dominance='5.75217391304'>the lawn</entity>, to report the place clear.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='559'>That Night Week</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='560'>During the whole of the week Irene had been thinking every other moment of her promise to the old lady, although even now she could not feel quite sure that she had not been dreaming.  Could it really be that an old lady lived up in the top of the house, with pigeons and a spinning-wheel, and a lamp that never went out?  She was, however, none the less determined, on the coming Friday, to ascend the three stairs, walk through the passages with the many doors, and try to find <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='grandmother;none;door;stair;passage' adjectives='many;less' verbs='be;have;ascend;walk;try;see;determine;dream;find' valence='6.094375' arousal='3.7175' dominance='5.863125'>the tower</entity> in which she had either seen or dreamed her grandmother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='561'>Her nurse could not help wondering what had come to the child--she would sit so thoughtfully silent, and even in the midst of a game with her would so suddenly fall into a dreamy mood.  But Irene took care to betray nothing, whatever efforts Lootie might make to get at her thoughts.  And Lootie had to say to herself: "What an odd child she is!" and give it up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='562'>At length the longed-for Friday arrived, and lest Lootie should be moved to watch her, Irene endeavoured to keep herself as quiet as possible.  In the afternoon she asked for her doll"s house, and went on arranging and rearranging the various rooms and their inhabitants for a whole hour.  Then she gave a sigh and threw herself back in her chair. One of the dolls would not sit, and another would not stand, and they were all very tiresome.  Indeed, there was one would not even lie down, which was too bad.  But it was now getting dark, and the darker it got the more excited <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='dark;more;necessary;excited;darker' verbs='feel;be;become;compose;get' valence='6.135' arousal='3.943' dominance='5.661'>Irene</entity> became, and the more she felt it necessary to be composed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='563'>"I see you want your tea, princess," said the nurse: "I will go and get it.  The room feels close: I will open the window a little. The evening is mild: it won"t hurt you."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='565'>I fancy Lootie was longer in returning than she had intended; for when Irene, who had been lost in thought, looked up, she saw it was nearly dark, and at the same moment caught sight of a pair of eyes, bright with a green light, glowering at her through the open window.  The next instant something leaped into the room.  It was like a cat, with legs as long as a horse"s, Irene said, but its body no bigger and its legs no thicker than those of a cat.  She was too frightened to cry out, but not too frightened to jump from her chair and run from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='chair' adjectives='frightened' verbs='jump;be;cry;run' valence='4.82375' arousal='4.555' dominance='4.53875'>the room</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='566'>It is plain enough to every one of my readers what she ought to have done--and indeed, Irene thought of it herself; but when she came to the foot of the old stair, just outside the nursery door, she imagined the creature running up those long ascents after her, and pursuing her through the dark passages--which, after all, might lead to no tower! That thought was too much.  Her heart failed her, and, turning from the stair, she rushed along to the hall, whence, finding the front door open, she darted into the court pursued--at least she thought so--by the creature.  No one happening to see her, on she ran, unable to think for fear, and ready to run anywhere to elude the awful creature with the stilt-legs.  Not daring to look behind her, she rushed straight out of the gate and up the mountain.  It was foolish indeed--thus to run farther and farther from all who could help her, as if she had been seeking a fit spot for the goblin creature to eat her in his leisure; but that is <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='spot;leisure;thing;fear;goblin;side;creature' adjectives='foolish;afraid;fit' verbs='be;run;help;serve;have;seek;eat' valence='5.48318181818' arousal='4.10454545455' dominance='5.32772727273'>the way</entity> fear serves us: it always sides with the thing we are afraid of.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='567'>The princess was soon out of breath with running uphill; but she ran on, for she fancied the horrible creature just behind her, forgetting that, had it been after her such long legs as those must have overtaken her long ago.  At last she could run no longer, and fell, unable even to scream, by the roadside, where she lay for some time half dead with terror.  But finding nothing lay hold of her, and her breath beginning to come back, she ventured at length to get half up and peer anxiously about her.  It was now so dark she could see nothing.  Not a single star was out.  She could not even tell in what direction the house lay, and between her and home she fancied the dreadful creature lying ready to pounce upon her. She saw now that she ought to have run up the stairs at once.  It was well she did not scream; for, although very few of the goblins had come out for weeks, a stray idler or two might have heard her. She sat down upon a stone, and nobody but one who had done something wrong could have been more miserable.  She had quite forgotten her promise to visit her grandmother.  A raindrop fell on her face.  She looked up, and for a moment her terror was lost in astonishment.  At first she thought the rising moon had left her place, and drawn nigh to see what could be the matter with the little girl, sitting alone, without hat or cloak, on the dark bare mountain; but she soon saw she was mistaken, for there was no light on the ground at her feet, and no shadow anywhere.  But a great silver globe was hanging in the air; and as she gazed at the lovely thing, her courage revived.  If she were but indoors again, she would fear nothing, not even the terrible creature with the long legs!  But how was she to find her way back?  What could that light be?  Could it be--? No, it couldn"t.  But what if it should be--yes--it must be--her great-great-grandmother"s lamp, which guided her pigeons home through the darkest night!  She jumped up: she had but to keep that light in view and she must find the house.  Her heart grew strong.  Speedily, yet softly, she walked down the hill, hoping to pass the watching creature unseen.  Dark as it was, there was little danger now of choosing the wrong road.  And--which was most strange--the light that filled her eyes from the lamp, instead of blinding them for a moment to the object upon which they next fell, enabled her for a moment to see it, despite the darkness.  By looking at the lamp and then dropping her eyes, she could see the road for a yard or two in front of her, and this saved her from several falls, for the road was very rough.  But all at once, to her dismay, it vanished, and the terror of the beast, which had left her the moment she began to return, again laid hold of her heart.  The same instant, however, she caught the light of the windows, and knew exactly where she was.  It was too dark to run, but she made what haste she could, and reached the gate in safety.  She found <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='right;door;room;stair;nursery;way;foot;avenue' adjectives='open;silent;long;next' verbs='turn;run;find;bound;look' valence='5.78681818182' arousal='3.875' dominance='5.70590909091'>the house</entity> door still open, ran through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='right;door;room;stair;nursery;way;foot;avenue' adjectives='open;silent;long;next' verbs='turn;run;find;bound;look' valence='5.78681818182' arousal='3.875' dominance='5.70590909091'>the hall</entity>, and, without even looking into the nursery, bounded straight up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='right;door;room;stair;nursery;way;foot;avenue' adjectives='open;silent;long;next' verbs='turn;run;find;bound;look' valence='5.78681818182' arousal='3.875' dominance='5.70590909091'>the stair</entity>, and the next, and the next; then turning to the right, ran through the long avenue of silent rooms, and found her way at once to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='right;door;room;stair;nursery;way;foot;avenue' adjectives='open;silent;long;next' verbs='turn;run;find;bound;look' valence='5.78681818182' arousal='3.875' dominance='5.70590909091'>the door</entity> at the foot of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='right;door;room;stair;nursery;way;foot;avenue' adjectives='open;silent;long;next' verbs='turn;run;find;bound;look' valence='5.78681818182' arousal='3.875' dominance='5.70590909091'>the tower</entity> stair.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='568'>When first the nurse missed her, she fancied she was playing her a trick, and for some time took no trouble about her; but at last, getting frightened, she had begun to search; and when the princess entered, the whole household was hither and thither over the house, hunting for her.  A few seconds after she reached the stair of the tower they had even begun to search the neglected rooms, in which they would never have thought of looking had they not already searched every other place they could think of in vain.  But by this time she was knocking at the old lady"s door.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='573'>The princess opened the door and peeped in.  But the room was quite dark and there was no sound of the spinning-wheel.  She grew frightened once more, thinking that, although the room was there, the old lady might be a dream after all.  Every little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she thought somebody was; but Irene had to fancy for a moment that the person she came to find was nowhere at all. She remembered, however, that at night she spun only in the moonlight, and concluded that must be why there was no sweet, bee-like humming: the old lady might be somewhere in the darkness.  Before she had time to think another thought, she heard her voice again, saying as before: "Come in, Irene."  From the sound, she understood at once that she was not in the room beside her.  Perhaps she was in her bedroom.  She turned across the passage, feeling her way to the other door.  When her hand fell on the lock, again the old lady spoke:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='574'>"Shut the other door behind you, Irene.  I always close <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='chamber;workroom' adjectives='' verbs='go;close' valence='5.285' arousal='4.40666666667' dominance='5.47833333333'>the door</entity> of my workroom when I go to my chamber."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='575'>Irene wondered to hear her voice so plainly through the door: having shut the other, she opened it and went in.  Oh, what a lovely haven to reach from the darkness and fear through which she had come!  The soft light made her feel as if she were going into the heart of the milkiest pearl; while the blue walls and their silver stars for a moment perplexed her with the fancy that they were in reality the sky which she had left outside a minute ago covered with rainclouds.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='577'>Then Irene looked again, and saw that what she had taken for a huge bouquet of red roses on a low stand against the wall was in fact a fire which burned in the shapes of the loveliest and reddest roses, glowing gorgeously between the heads and wings of two cherubs of shining silver.  And when she came nearer, she found that the smell of roses with which the room was filled came from the fire-roses on the hearth. Her grandmother was dressed in the loveliest pale blue velvet, over which her hair, no longer white, but of a rich golden colour, streamed like a cataract, here falling in dull gathered heaps, there rushing away in smooth shining falls.  And ever as she looked, the hair seemed pouring down from her head and vanishing in a golden mist ere it reached the floor.  It flowed from under the edge of a circle of shining silver, set with alternated pearls and opals.  On her dress was no ornament whatever, neither was there a ring on her hand, or a necklace or carcanet about her neck.  But her slippers glimmered with the light of the Milky Way, for they were covered with seed-pearls and opals in one mass.  Her face was that of a woman of three-and-twenty.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='691'>The spring so dear to all creatures, young and old, came at last, and before the first few days of it had gone, the king rode through its budding valleys to see his little daughter.  He had been in a distant part of his dominions all the winter, for he was not in the habit of stopping in one great city, or of visiting only his favourite country houses, but he moved from place to place, that all his people might know him.  Wherever he journeyed, he kept a constant look-out for the ablest and best men to put into office; and wherever he found himself mistaken, and those he had appointed incapable or unjust, he removed them at once.  Hence you see it was his care of the people that kept him from seeing his princess so often as he would have liked.  You may wonder why he did not take her about with him; but there were several reasons against his doing so, and I suspect her great-great-grandmother had had a principal hand in preventing it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='702'>The king was much disturbed on hearing the report of the gentlemen-at-arms concerning the creatures they had seen; and I presume would have taken Irene with him that very day, but for what the presence of the ring on her finger assured him of.

When he went away he left other six gentlemen behind him, that there might be six of them always on guard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='703'>And now, in the lovely spring weather, Irene was out on the mountain the greater part of the day.  In the warmer hollows there were lovely primroses, and not so many that she ever got tired of them.  As often as she saw a new one opening an eye of light in the blind earth, she would clap her hands with gladness, and unlike some children I know, instead of pulling it, would touch it as tenderly as if it had been a new baby, and, having made its acquaintance, would leave it as happy as she found it.  She treated the plants on which they grew like birds" nests; every fresh flower was like a new little bird to her.  She would pay visits to all the flower-nests she knew, remembering each by itself.  She would go down on her hands and knees beside one and say: "Good morning!  Are you all smelling very sweet this morning? Good-bye!" and then she would go to another nest, and say the same.  It was a favourite amusement with her.  There were many flowers up and down, and she loved them all, but the primroses were her favourites.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='705'>There were goats too about, over the mountain, and when the little kids came she was as pleased with them as with the flowers.  The goats belonged to the miners mostly-a few of them to Curdie"s mother; but there were a good many wild ones that seemed to belong to nobody. These the goblins counted theirs, and it was upon them partly that they lived.  They set snares and dug pits for them; and did not scruple to take what tame ones happened to be caught; but they did not try to steal them in any other manner, because they were afraid of the dogs the hill-people kept to watch them, for the knowing dogs always tried to bite their feet.  But the goblins had a kind of sheep of their own--very queer creatures, which they drove out to feed at night, and the other goblin creatures were wise enough to keep good watch over them, for they knew they should have their bones by and by.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='709'>Curdie was as watchful as ever, but was almost getting tired of his ill success.  Every other night or so he followed the goblins about, as they went on digging and boring, and getting as near them as he could, watched them from behind stones and rocks; but as yet he seemed no nearer finding out what they had in view.  As at first, he always kept hold of the end of his string, while his pickaxe, left just outside the hole by which he entered the goblins" country from the mine, continued to serve as an anchor and hold fast the other end.  The goblins, hearing no more noise in that quarter, had ceased to apprehend an immediate invasion, and kept no watch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='710'>One night, after dodging about and listening till he was nearly falling asleep with weariness, he began to roll up his ball, for he had resolved to go home to bed.  It was not long, however, before he began to feel bewildered.  One after another he passed goblin houses, caves, that is, occupied by goblin families, and at length was sure they were many more than he had passed as he came.  He had to use great caution to pass unseen--they lay so close together. Could his string have led him wrong?  He still followed winding it, and still it led him into more thickly populated quarters, until he became quite uneasy, and indeed apprehensive; for although he was not afraid of the cobs, he was afraid of not finding his way out. But what could he do?  It was of no use to sit down and wait for the morning--the morning made no difference here.  It was dark, and always dark; and if his string failed him he was helpless.  He might even arrive within a yard of the mine and never know it. Seeing he could do nothing better he would at least find where the end of his string was, and, if possible, how it had come to play him such a trick.  He knew by the size of the ball that he was getting pretty near the last of it, when he began to feel a tugging and pulling at it.  What could it mean?  Turning a sharp corner, he thought he heard strange sounds.  These grew, as he went on, to a scuffling and growling and squeaking; and the noise increased, until, turning a second sharp corner, he found himself in the midst of it, and the same moment tumbled over a wallowing mass, which he knew must be a knot of the cobs" creatures.  Before he could recover his feet, he had caught some great scratches on his face and several severe bites on his legs and arms.  But as he scrambled to get up, his hand fell upon his pickaxe, and before the horrid beasts could do him any serious harm, he was laying about with it right and left in the dark. The hideous cries which followed gave him the satisfaction of knowing that he had punished some of them pretty smartly for their rudeness, and by their scampering and their retreating howls, he perceived that he had routed them.  He stood for a little, weighing his battle-axe in his hand as if it had been the most precious lump of metal--but indeed no lump of gold itself could have been so precious at the time as that common tool--then untied the end of the string from it, put the ball in his pocket, and still stood thinking.  It was clear that the cobs" creatures had found his axe, had between them carried it off, and had so led him he knew not where.  But for all his thinking he could not tell what he ought to do, until suddenly he became aware of a glimmer of light in the distance.  Without a moment"s hesitation he set out for it, as fast as the unknown and rugged way would permit.  Yet again turning a corner, led by the dim light, he spied something quite new in his experience of the underground regions--a small irregular shape of something shining.  Going up to it, he found it was a piece of mica, or Muscovy glass, called sheep-silver in Scotland, and the light flickered as if from a fire behind it.  After trying in vain for some time to discover an entrance to the place where it was burning, he came at length to a small chamber in which an opening, high in the wall, revealed a glow beyond.  To this opening he managed to scramble up, and then he saw a strange sight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='711'>Below sat a little group of goblins around a fire, the smoke of which vanished in the darkness far aloft.  The sides of the cave were full of shining minerals like those of the palace hall; and the company was evidently of a superior order, for every one wore stones about head, or arms, or waist, shining dull gorgeous colours in the light of the fire. Nor had Curdie looked long before he recognized the king himself, and found that he had made his way into the inner apartment of the royal family.  He had never had such a good chance of hearing something.  He crept through the hole as softly as he could, scrambled a good way down the wall towards them without attracting attention, and then sat down and listened. The king, evidently the queen, and probably the crown prince and the Prime Minister were talking together.  He was sure of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='foot;shoe' adjectives='sure' verbs='be;see;warm' valence='5.735' arousal='3.985' dominance='5.78625'>the queen</entity> by her shoes, for as she warmed her feet at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foot;shoe' adjectives='sure' verbs='be;see;warm' valence='5.735' arousal='3.985' dominance='5.78625'>the fire</entity>, he saw them quite plainly.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='718'>"You must acknowledge, however," the king said, with a little groan, "that this at least is no whim of Harelip"s, but a matter of State policy.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='743'>"Stand back," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='knee;pickaxe' adjectives='tighter' verbs='grasp;say;stand' valence='5.218' arousal='3.684' dominance='5.97'>Curdie</entity>, grasping his pickaxe tighter by his knee.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='744'>They only grinned and pressed closer.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bethought' adjectives='' verbs='begin;rhyme' valence='6.51' arousal='3.22' dominance='5.905'>Curdie</entity> bethought himself and began to rhyme.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='748'>The goblins fell back a little when he began, and made horrible grimaces all through the rhyme, as if eating something so disagreeable that it set their teeth on edge and gave them the creeps; but whether it was that the rhyming words were most of them no words at all, for, a new rhyme being considered the more efficacious, Curdie had made it on the spur of the moment, or whether it was that the presence of the king and queen gave them courage, I cannot tell; but the moment the rhyme was over they crowded on him again, and out shot a hundred long arms, with a multitude of thick nailless fingers at the ends of them, to lay hold upon him.  Then Curdie heaved up his axe.  But being as gentle as courageous and not wishing to kill any of them, he turned the end which was square and blunt like a hammer, and with that came down a great blow on the head of the goblin nearest him.  Hard as the heads of all goblins are, he thought he must feel that.  And so he did, no doubt; but he only gave a horrible cry, and sprung at Curdie"s throat. Curdie, however, drew back in time, and just at that critical moment remembered the vulnerable part of the goblin body.  He made a sudden rush at the king and stamped with all his might on His Majesty"s feet. The king gave a most unkingly howl and almost fell into the fire. Curdie then rushed into the crowd, stamping right and left.  The goblins drew back, howling on every side as he approached, but they were so crowded that few of those he attacked could escape his tread; and the shrieking and roaring that filled the cave would have appalled Curdie but for the good hope it gave him.  They were tumbling over each other in heaps in their eagerness to rush from the cave, when a new assailant suddenly faced him--the queen, with flaming eyes and expanded nostrils, her hair standing half up from her head, rushed at him. She trusted in her shoes: they were of granite--hollowed like French sabots.  Curdie would have endured much rather than hurt a woman, even if she was a goblin; but here was an affair of life and death: forgetting her shoes, he made a great stamp on one of her feet.  But she instantly returned it with very different effect, causing him frightful pain, and almost disabling him.  His only chance with her would have been to attack the granite shoes with his pickaxe, but before he could think of that she had caught him up in her arms and was rushing with him across the cave.  She dashed him into a hole in the wall, with a force that almost stunned him.  But although he could not move, he was not too far gone to hear her great cry, and the rush of multitudes of soft feet, followed by the sounds of something heaved up against the rock; after which came a multitudinous patter of stones falling near him.  The last had not ceased when he grew very faint, for his head had been badly cut, and at last insensible.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='749'>When he came to himself there was perfect silence about him, and utter darkness, but for the merest glimmer in one tiny spot.  He crawled to it, and found that they had heaved a slab against the mouth of the hole, past the edge of which a poor little gleam found its way from the fire.  He could not move it a hairbreadth, for they had piled a great heap of stones against it.  He crawled back to where he had been lying, in the faint hope of finding his pickaxe, But after a vain search he was at last compelled to acknowledge himself in an evil plight.  He sat down and tried to think, but soon fell fast asleep.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='811'>That same morning early, the princess woke in a terrible fright. There was a hideous noise in her room--creatures snarling and hissing and rocketing about as if they were fighting.  The moment she came to herself, she remembered something she had never thought of again--what her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened.  She immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow.  As she did so she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under her palm.  "It must be my grandmother!" she said to herself, and the thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty little slippers before running from the room.  While doing this she caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue, thrown over the back of a chair by the bedside.  She had never seen it before but it was evidently waiting for her.  She put it on, and then, feeling with the forefinger of her right hand, soon found her grandmother"s thread, which she proceeded at once to follow, expecting it would lead her straight up the old stair. When she reached the door she found it went down and ran along the floor, so that she had almost to crawl in order to keep a hold of it.  Then, to her surprise, and somewhat to her dismay, she found that instead of leading her towards the stair it turned in quite the opposite direction.  It led her through certain narrow passages towards the kitchen, turning aside ere she reached it, and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard. Some of the maids were already up, and this door was standing open. Across the yard the thread still ran along the ground, until it brought her to a door in the wall which opened upon the Mountainside.  When she had passed through, the thread rose to about half her height, and she could hold it with ease as she walked.  It led her straight up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='straight' verbs='lead' valence='6.105' arousal='4.035' dominance='5.7'>the mountain</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='812'>The cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed.  The cook"s great black cat, pursued by the housekeeper"s terrier, had bounced against her bedroom door, which had not been properly fastened, and the two had burst into the room together and commenced a battle royal.  How the nurse came to sleep through it was a mystery, but I suspect the old lady had something to do with it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='813'>It was a clear warm morning.  The wind blew deliciously over the Mountainside.  Here and there she saw a late primrose but she did not stop to call upon them.  The sky was mottled with small clouds.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='814'>The sun was not yet up, but some of their fluffy edges had caught his light, and hung out orange and gold-coloured fringes upon the air.  The dew lay in round drops upon the leaves, and hung like tiny diamond ear-rings from the blades of grass about her path.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='815'>"How lovely that bit of gossamer is!" thought the princess, looking at a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the hill.  It was not the time for gossamers though; and Irene soon discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in the light of the morning.  It was leading her she knew not whither; but she had never in her life been out before sunrise, and everything was so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming, that she felt too happy to be afraid of anything.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='816'>After leading her up a good distance, the thread turned to the left, and down the path upon which she and Lootie had met Curdie. But she never thought of that, for now in the morning light, with its far outlook over the country, no path could have been more open and airy and cheerful.  She could see the road almost to the horizon, along which she had so often watched her king-papa and his troop come shining, with the bugle-blast cleaving the air before them; and it was like a companion to her.  Down and down the path went, then up, and then down and then up again, getting rugged and more rugged as it went; and still along the path went the silvery thread, and still along the thread went Irene"s little rosy-tipped forefinger.  By and by she came to a little stream that jabbered and prattled down the hill, and up the side of the stream went both path and thread.  And still the path grew rougher and steeper, and the mountain grew wilder, till Irene began to think she was going a very long way from home; and when she turned to look back she saw that the level country had vanished and the rough bare mountain had closed in about her.  But still on went the thread, and on went the princess.  Everything around her was getting brighter and brighter as the sun came nearer; till at length his first rays all at once alighted on the top of a rock before her, like some golden creature fresh from the sky.  Then she saw that the little stream ran out of a hole in that rock, that the path did not go past the rock, and that the thread was leading her straight up to it.  A shudder ran through her from head to foot when she found that the thread was actually taking her into the hole out of which the stream ran.  It ran out babbling joyously, but she had to go in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='817'>She did not hesitate.  Right into the hole she went, which was high enough to let her walk without stooping.  For a little way there was a brown glimmer, but at the first turn it all but ceased, and before she had gone many paces she was in total darkness.  Then she began to be frightened indeed.  Every moment she kept feeling the thread backwards and forwards, and as she went farther and farther into the darkness of the great hollow mountain, she kept thinking more and more about her grandmother, and all that she had said to her, and how kind she had been, and how beautiful she was, and all about her lovely room, and the fire of roses, and the great lamp that sent its light through stone walls.  And she became more and more sure that the thread could not have gone there of itself, and that her grandmother must have sent it. But it tried her dreadfully when the path went down very steep, and especially When she came to places where she had to go down rough stairs, and even sometimes a ladder.  Through one narrow passage after another, over lumps of rock and sand and clay, the thread guided her, until she came to a small hole through which she had to creep.  Finding no change on the other side, "Shall I ever get back?" she thought, over and over again, wondering at herself that she was not ten times more frightened, and often feeling as if she were only walking in the story of a dream.  Sometimes she heard the noise of water, a dull gurgling inside the rock.  By and by she heard the sounds of blows, which came nearer and nearer; but again they grew duller, and almost died away. In a hundred directions she turned, obedient to the guiding thread.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='818'>At last she spied a dull red shine, and came up to the mica window, and thence away and round about, and right, into a cavern, where glowed the red embers of a fire.  Here the thread began to rise. It rose as high as her head and higher still.  What should she do if she lost her hold? She was pulling it down: She might break it! She could see it far up, glowing as red as her fire-opal in the light of the embers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='819'>But presently she came to a huge heap of stones, piled in a slope against the wall of the cavern.  On these she climbed, and soon recovered the level of the thread only however to find, the next moment, that it vanished through the heap of stones, and left her standing on it, with her face to the solid rock.  For one terrible moment she felt as if her grandmother had forsaken her.  The thread which the spiders had spun far over the seas, which her grandmother had sat in the moonlight and spun again for her, which she had tempered in the rose-fire and tied to her opal ring, had left her--had gone where she could no longer follow it--had brought her into a horrible cavern, and there left her!  She was forsaken indeed!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='820'>"When shall I wake?" she said to herself in an agony, but the same moment knew that it was no dream.  She threw herself upon the heap, and began to cry.  It was well she did not know what creatures, one of them with stone shoes on her feet, were lying in the next cave. But neither did she know who was on the other side of the slab.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='821'>At length the thought struck her that at least she could follow the thread backwards, and thus get out of the mountain, and home.  She rose at once, and found the thread.  But the instant she tried to feel it backwards, it vanished from her touch.  Forwards, it led her hand up to the heap of stones--backwards it seemed nowhere. Neither could she see it as before in the light of the fire.  She burst into a wailing cry, and again threw herself down on the stones.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='824'>The Escape</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='825'>As the princess lay and sobbed she kept feeling the thread mechanically, following it with her finger many times up to the stones in which it disappeared.  By and by she began, still mechanically, to poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could. All at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the stones and see where the thread went next. Almost laughing at herself for never having thought of this before, she jumped to her feet.  Her fear vanished; once more she was certain her grandmother"s thread could not have brought her there just to leave her there; and she began to throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could, sometimes two or three at a handful, sometimes taking both hands to lift one.  After clearing them away a little, she found that the thread turned and went straight downwards.  Hence, as the heap sloped a good deal, growing of course wider towards its base, she had to throw away a multitude of stones to follow the thread.  But this was not all, for she soon found that the thread, after going straight down for a little way, turned first sideways in one direction, then sideways in another, and then shot, at various angles, hither and thither inside the heap, so that she began to be afraid that to clear the thread she must remove the whole huge gathering.  She was dismayed at the very idea, but, losing no time, set to work with a will; and with aching back, and bleeding fingers and hands, she worked on, sustained by the pleasure of seeing the heap slowly diminish and begin to show itself on the opposite side of the fire.  Another thing which helped to keep up her courage was that, as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread, instead of lying loose upon the stone, it tightened up; this made her sure that her grandmother was at the end of it somewhere.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='826'>She had got about half-way down when she started, and nearly fell with fright.  Close to her ears as it seemed, a voice broke out singing:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='853'>But she was soon satisfied that what Curdie wanted done and what the thread wanted done were one and the same thing.  For she not only saw that by following the turns of the thread she had been clearing the face of the slab, but that, a little more than half-way down, the thread went through the chink between the slab and the wall into the place where Curdie was confined, so that she could not follow it any farther until the slab was out of her way. As soon as she found this, she said in a right joyous whisper:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='856'>Irene got off the heap, and stood on one side of it.  "Now, Curdie!" she cried.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='857'>Curdie gave a great rush with his shoulder against it.  Out tumbled the slab on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='top;slab' adjectives='' verbs='creep;tumble' valence='4.736' arousal='3.966' dominance='5.012'>the heap</entity>, and out crept <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='top;slab' adjectives='' verbs='creep;tumble' valence='4.736' arousal='3.966' dominance='5.012'>Curdie</entity> over the top of it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='861'>"Oh, no, it"s quite easy," said Irene.  "We have only to follow my thread.  I am sure that it"s going to take us out now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='862'>She had already begun to follow it over the fallen slab into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pickaxe;slab' adjectives='' verbs='be;begin;search;have;fall;follow' valence='5.325' arousal='3.396' dominance='4.937'>the hole</entity>, while <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pickaxe;slab' adjectives='' verbs='be;begin;search;have;fall;follow' valence='5.325' arousal='3.396' dominance='4.937'>Curdie</entity> was searching <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pickaxe;slab' adjectives='' verbs='be;begin;search;have;fall;follow' valence='5.325' arousal='3.396' dominance='4.937'>the floor</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pickaxe;slab' adjectives='' verbs='be;begin;search;have;fall;follow' valence='5.325' arousal='3.396' dominance='4.937'>the cavern</entity> for his pickaxe.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='863'>"Here it is!" he cried.  "No, it is not," he added, in a disappointed tone.  "What can it be, then?  I declare it"s a torch. That is jolly! It"s better almost than my pickaxe.  Much better if it weren"t for those stone shoes!" he went on, as he lighted the torch by blowing the last embers of the expiring fire.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='864'>When he looked up, with the lighted torch casting a glare into the great darkness of the huge cavern, he caught sight of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='torch;glare;darkness;sight;cavern' adjectives='huge;great' verbs='look;light;cast;have;catch;come;disappear' valence='5.49375' arousal='3.9175' dominance='5.386875'>Irene</entity> disappearing in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='torch;glare;darkness;sight;cavern' adjectives='huge;great' verbs='look;light;cast;have;catch;come;disappear' valence='5.49375' arousal='3.9175' dominance='5.386875'>the hole</entity> out of which he had himself just come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='865'>"Where are you going there?" he cried.  "That"s not the way out. That"s where I couldn"t get out."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='866'>"I know that," whispered Irene.  "But this is <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thread' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;follow' valence='5.59714285714' arousal='3.98857142857' dominance='5.14714285714'>the way</entity> my thread goes, and I must follow it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='867'>"What nonsense the child talks!" said Curdie to himself.  "I must follow her, though, and see that she comes to no harm.  She will soon find she can"t get out that way, and then she will come with me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='868'>So he crept over the slab once more into the hole with his torch in his hand.  But when he looked about in it, he could see her nowhere.  And now he discovered that although the hole was narrow, it was much longer than he had supposed; for in one direction the roof came down very low, and the hole went off in a narrow passage, of which he could not see the end.  The princess must have crept in there.  He got on his knees and one hand, holding the torch with the other, and crept after her. The hole twisted about, in some parts so low that he could hardly get through, in others so high that he could not see the roof, but everywhere it was narrow--far too narrow for a goblin to get through, and so I presume they never thought that Curdie might.  He was beginning to feel very uncomfortable lest something should have befallen <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='whispering;ear;voice;something' adjectives='uncomfortable' verbs='be;begin;feel;befall;hear;have' valence='5.74727272727' arousal='3.94' dominance='5.61272727273'>the princess</entity>, when he heard her voice almost close to his ear, whispering:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='870'>And when he turned the next corner there she stood waiting for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='871'>"I knew you couldn"t go wrong in that narrow hole, but now you must keep by me, for here is a great wide place," she said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='872'>"I can"t understand it," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='t;half' adjectives='' verbs='say;understand' valence='5.8' arousal='4.218' dominance='6.006'>Curdie</entity>, half to himself, half to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='t;half' adjectives='' verbs='say;understand' valence='5.8' arousal='4.218' dominance='6.006'>Irene</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='873'>"Never mind," she returned.  "Wait till we get out."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='874'>Curdie, utterly astonished that she had already got so far, and by a path he had known nothing of, thought it better to let her do as she pleased.  "At all events," he said again to himself, "I know nothing about the way, miner as I am; and she seems to think she does know something about it, though how she should passes my comprehension.  So she"s just as likely to find her way as I am, and as she insists on taking the lead, I must follow.  We can"t be much worse off than we are, anyhow."  Reasoning thus, he followed her a few steps, and came out in another great cavern, across which Irene walked in a straight line, as confidently as if she knew every step of the way.  Curdie went on after her, flashing his torch about, and trying to see something of what lay around them. Suddenly he started back a pace as the light fell upon something close by which Irene was passing.  It was a platform of rock raised a few feet from the floor and covered with sheepskins, upon which lay two horrible figures asleep, at once recognized by Curdie as the king and queen of the goblins.  He lowered his torch instantly lest the light should awake them.  As he did so it flashed upon his pickaxe, lying by the side of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pickaxe;side;hand' adjectives='' verbs='do;flash;handle;lay;lie' valence='5.35666666667' arousal='4.11333333333' dominance='5.77888888889'>the queen</entity>, whose hand lay close by the handle of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='875'>"Stop one moment," he whispered.  "Hold my torch, and don"t let the light on their faces."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='876'>Irene shuddered when she saw the frightful creatures, whom she had passed without observing them, but she did as he requested, and turning her back, held the torch low in front of her.  Curdie drew his pickaxe carefully away, and as he did so spied one of her feet, projecting from under the skins.  The great clumsy granite shoe, exposed thus to his hand, was a temptation not to be resisted.  He laid hold of it, and, with cautious efforts, drew it off.  The moment he succeeded, he saw to his astonishment that what he had sung in ignorance, to annoy the queen, was actually true: she had six horrible toes.  Overjoyed at his success, and seeing by the huge bump in the sheepskins where the other foot was, he proceeded to lift them gently, for, if he could only succeed in carrying away the other shoe as well, he would be no more afraid of the goblins than of so many flies.  But as he pulled at the second shoe the queen gave a growl and sat up in bed.  The same instant <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='instant' adjectives='same' verbs='awake;sit' valence='6.105' arousal='4.3675' dominance='6.1225'>the king</entity> awoke also and sat up beside her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='880'>He darted to her side, forgetting neither the queen"s shoe nor his pickaxe, and caught hold of her hand, as she sped fearlessly where her thread guided her.  They heard the queen give a great bellow; but they had a good start, for it would be some time before they could get torches lighted to pursue them.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='893'>The princess asked more questions, and Curdie, as they walked leisurely along, gave her a full account, not only of the character and habits of the goblins, so far as he knew them, but of his own adventures with them, beginning from the very night after that in which he had met her and Lootie upon the mountain.  When he had finished, he begged Irene to tell him how it was that she had come to his rescue.  So Irene too had to tell a long story, which she did in rather a roundabout manner, interrupted by many questions concerning things she had not explained. But her tale, as he did not believe more than half of it, left everything as unaccountable to him as before, and he was nearly as much perplexed as to what he must think of the princess.

In one or two places he had to break away the rock to make room before even Irene could get through--at least without hurting herself.  But at length they spied a glimmer of light, and in a minute more they were almost blinded by the full sunlight, into which they emerged.  It was some little time before the princess could see well enough to discover that they stood in her own garden, close by the seat on which she and her king-papa had sat that afternoon.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='971'>"It means, my love, that I did not mean to show myself.  Curdie is not yet able to believe some things.  Seeing is not believing--it is only seeing.  You remember I told you that if Lootie were to see me, she would rub her eyes, forget the half she saw, and call the other half nonsense."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='972'>"Yes; but I should have thought Curdie--"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='973'>"You are right.  Curdie is much farther on than Lootie, and you will see what will come of it.

But there is one thing much more necessary."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='974'>"What is that, grandmother?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='975'>"To understand other people."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='976'>"Yes, grandmother.  I must be fair--for if I"m not fair to other people, I"m not worth being understood myself.  I see.  So as Curdie can"t help it, I will not be vexed with him, but just wait."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='977'>"There"s my own dear child," said her grandmother, and pressed her close to her bosom.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='978'>"Why weren"t you in your workroom when we came up, grandmother?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='moment;silence' adjectives='few' verbs='ask' valence='5.575' arousal='4.0025' dominance='5.8875'>Irene</entity>, after a few moments" silence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='979'>"If I had been there, Curdie would have seen me well enough.  But why should I be there rather than in this beautiful room?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='980'>"I thought you would be spinning."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='981'>"I"ve nobody to spin for just at present.  I never spin without knowing for whom I am spinning."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='982'>"That reminds me--there is one thing that puzzles me," said the princess: "how are you to get the thread out of the mountain again? Surely you won"t have to make another for me?  That would be such a trouble!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='983'>The lady set her down and rose and went to the fire.  Putting in her hand, she drew it out again and held up the shining ball between her finger and thumb.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='984'>"I"ve got it now, you see," she said, coming back to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='ready' verbs='see;come;say;want;get' valence='5.99444444444' arousal='4.19666666667' dominance='5.76444444444'>the princess</entity>, "all ready for you when you want it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='985'>Going to her cabinet, she laid it in the same drawer as before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='986'>"And here is your ring," she added, taking it from the little finger of her left hand and putting it on the forefinger of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;ring;forefinger;finger;hand' adjectives='little;right;left' verbs='put;be;add;take' valence='5.93090909091' arousal='4.23181818182' dominance='5.72'>Irene</entity>"s right hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='987'>"Oh, thank you, grandmother! I feel so safe now!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='988'>"You are very tired, my child," the lady went on.  "Your hands are hurt with the stones, and I have counted nine bruises on you.  Just look what you are like."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='989'>And she held up to her a little mirror which she had brought from the cabinet.  The princess burst into a merry laugh at the sight. She was so draggled with the stream and dirty with creeping through narrow places, that if she had seen the reflection without knowing it was a reflection, she would have taken herself for some gipsy child whose face was washed and hair combed about once in a month. The lady laughed too, and lifting her again upon her knee, took off her cloak and night-gown.  Then she carried her to the side of the room.  Irene wondered what she was going to do with her, but asked no questions--only starting a little when she found that she was going to lay her in the large silver bath; for as she looked into it, again she saw no bottom, but the stars shining miles away, as it seemed, in a great blue gulf.  Her hands closed involuntarily on the beautiful arms that held her, and that was all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='990'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bosom' adjectives='more' verbs='press;say' valence='6.1625' arousal='3.995' dominance='5.6325'>The lady</entity> pressed her once more to her bosom, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='991'>"Do not be afraid, my child."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='992'>"No, grandmother," answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grandmother;water;instant' adjectives='little;cool;clear;next' verbs='answer;gasp;sink' valence='6.10818181818' arousal='4.16909090909' dominance='5.62909090909'>the princess</entity>, with a little gasp; and the next instant she sank in the clear cool water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='993'>When she opened her eyes, she saw nothing but a strange lovely blue over and beneath and all about her.  The lady, and the beautiful room, had vanished from her sight, and she seemed utterly alone. But instead of being afraid, she felt more than happy--perfectly blissful.  And from somewhere came the voice of the lady, singing a strange sweet song, of which she could distinguish every word; but of the sense she had only a feeling--no understanding.  Nor could she remember a single line after it was gone.  It vanished, like the poetry in a dream, as fast as it came.  In after years, however, she would sometimes fancy that snatches of melody suddenly rising in her brain must be little phrases and fragments of the air of that song; and the very fancy would make her happier, and abler to do her duty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='994'>How long she lay in the water she did not know.  It seemed a long time--not from weariness but from pleasure.  But at last she felt the beautiful hands lay hold of her, and through the gurgling water she was lifted out into the lovely room.  The lady carried her to the fire, and sat down with her in her lap, and dried her tenderly with the softest towel.  It was so different from Lootie"s drying. When <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='snow' adjectives='white;night-gown' verbs='stoop;do;draw;have' valence='5.78875' arousal='3.9975' dominance='5.5625'>the lady</entity> had done, she stooped to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='snow' adjectives='white;night-gown' verbs='stoop;do;draw;have' valence='5.78875' arousal='3.9975' dominance='5.5625'>the fire</entity>, and drew from it her night-gown, as white as snow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='995'>"How delicious!" exclaimed the princess.  "It smells of all the roses in the world, I think."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='996'>When she stood up on the floor she felt as if she had been made over again.  Every bruise and all weariness were gone, and her hands were soft and whole as ever.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='997'>"Now I am going to put you to bed for a good sleep," said her grandmother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='998'>"But what will Lootie be thinking?  And what am I to say to her when she asks me where I have been?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='999'>"Don"t trouble yourself about it.  You will find it all come right," said her grandmother, and laid her into the blue bed, under the rosy counterpane.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1000'>"There is just one thing more," said Irene.  "I am a little anxious about Curdie.  As I brought him into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='home;way' adjectives='safe' verbs='bring;see;have' valence='6.109' arousal='3.848' dominance='5.705'>the house</entity>, I ought to have seen him safe on his way home."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1001'>"I took care of all that," answered the lady.  "I told you to let him go, and therefore I was bound to look after him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1006'>Curdie went up the mountain neither whistling nor singing, for he was vexed with Irene for taking him in, as he called it; and he was vexed with himself for having spoken to her so angrily.  His mother gave a cry of joy when she saw him, and at once set about getting him something to eat, asking him questions all the time, which he did not answer so cheerfully as usual.  When his meal was ready, she left him to eat it, and hurried to the mine to let his father know he was safe.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1009'>"And what happened after that?" asked his mother.  "You haven"t told us all.  You ought to be very happy at having got away from those demons, and instead of that I never saw you so gloomy.  There must be something more.  Besides, you do not speak of that lovely child as I should like to hear you.  She saved your life at the risk of her own, and yet somehow you don"t seem to think much of it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1010'>"She talked such nonsense" answered Curdie, "and told me a pack of things that weren"t a bit true; and I can"t get over it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='1015'>"Yes, of course, mother," he answered.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1016'>"Then you have no right to say what she told you was not true.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1017'>"It"s no explanation at all, mother; and I can"t believe it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1018'>"That may be only because you do not understand it.  If you did, you would probably find it was an explanation, and believe it thoroughly. I don"t blame you for not being able to believe it, but I do blame you for fancying such a child would try to deceive you.  Why should she? Depend upon it, she told you all she knew. Until you had found a better way of accounting for it all, you might at least have been more sparing of your judgement."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1019'>"That is what something inside me has been saying all the time," said Curdie, hanging down his head.  "But what do you make of the grandmother?  That is what I can"t get over.  To take me up to an old garret, and try to persuade me against the sight of my own eyes that it was a beautiful room, with blue walls and silver stars, and no end of things in it, when there was nothing there but an old tub and a withered apple and a heap of straw and a sunbeam!  It was too bad!  She might have had some old woman there at least to pass for her precious grandmother!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1021'>"Yes.  That"s what bothers me.  You would have thought she really meant and believed that she saw every one of the things she talked about. And not one of them there!  It was too bad, I say."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1022'>"Perhaps some people can see things other people can"t see, Curdie," said his mother very gravely.  "I think I will tell you something I saw myself once--only Perhaps You won"t believe me either!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1024'>"But what I am going to tell you is very strange," persisted his mother; "and if having heard it you were to say I must have been dreaming, I don"t know that I should have any right to be vexed with you, though I know at least that I was not asleep."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1026'>"That"s why I am tempted to tell you," replied his mother.  "But first, I may as well mention that, according to old whispers, there is something more than common about the king"s family; and the queen was of the same blood, for they were cousins of some degree. There were strange stories told concerning them--all good stories--but strange, very strange.  What they were I cannot tell, for I only remember the faces of my grandmother and my mother as they talked together about them.  There was wonder and awe--not fear--in their eyes, and they whispered, and never spoke aloud.  But what I saw myself was this: Your father was going to work in the mine one night, and I had been down with his supper.  It was soon after we were married, and not very long before you were born.  He came with me to the mouth of the mine, and left me to go home alone, for I knew the way almost as well as the floor of our own cottage.  It was pretty dark, and in some parts of the road where the rocks overhung nearly quite dark.  But I got along perfectly well, never thinking of being afraid, until I reached a spot you know well enough, Curdie, where the path has to make a sharp turn out of the way of a great rock on the left-hand side.  When I got there, I was suddenly surrounded by about half a dozen of the cobs, the first I had ever seen, although I had heard tell of them often enough. One of them blocked up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='way' adjectives='' verbs='begin;tease;make;shudder;torment;think;block' valence='5.16923076923' arousal='4.20692307692' dominance='5.23230769231'>the path</entity>, and they all began tormenting and teasing me in a way it makes me shudder to think of even now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1027'>"If I had only been with you!" cried father and son in a breath.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1028'>The mother gave a funny little smile, and went on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1029'>"They had some of their horrible creatures with them too, and I must confess I was dreadfully frightened.  They had torn my clothes very much, and I was afraid they were going to tear myself to pieces, when suddenly a great white soft light shone upon me.  I looked up.  A broad ray, like a shining road, came down from a large globe of silvery light, not very high up, indeed not quite so high as the horizon--so it could not have been a new star or another moon or anything of that sort.  The cobs dropped persecuting me, and looked dazed, and I thought they were going to run away, but presently they began again.  The same moment, however, down the path from the globe of light came a bird, shining like silver in the sun.  It gave a few rapid flaps first, and then, with its wings straight out, shot, sliding down the slope of the light.  It looked to me just like a white pigeon.  But whatever it was, when the cobs caught sight of it coming straight down upon them, they took to their heels and scampered away across the mountain, leaving me safe, only much frightened.  As soon as it had sent them off, the bird went gliding again up the light, and the moment it reached the globe the light disappeared, just as if a shutter had been closed over a window, and I saw it no More.  But I had no more trouble with the cobs that night or ever after."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1033'>"You don"t think I"m doubting my own mother?" cried Curdie. "There are other people in the world quite as well worth believing as your own mother," said his mother.  "I don"t know that she"s so much the fitter to be believed that she happens to be your mother, Mr. Curdie.  There are mothers far more likely to tell lies than the little girl I saw talking to the primroses a few weeks ago.  If she were to lie I should begin to doubt my own word."</paragraph>

She told me that Lootie didn"t know anything about her coming to get me out of the mountain.  I am certain she would have prevented her somehow if she had known it.

Now since I began to watch them, they have mined a good half-mile, in a straight line; and so far as I am aware, they are working in no other part of the mountain.  But I never could tell in what direction they were going.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1095'>Everything was for some time quiet above ground.  The king was still away in a distant part of his dominions.  The men-at-arms kept watching about the house.  They had been considerably astonished by finding at the foot of the rock in the garden the hideous body of the goblin creature killed by Curdie; but they came to the conclusion that it had been slain in the mines, and had crept out there to die; and except an occasional glimpse of a live one they saw nothing to cause alarm. Curdie kept watching in the mountain, and the goblins kept burrowing deeper into the earth.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1096'>To Irene the summer was as full of pleasure as ever, and for a long time, although she often thought of her grandmother during the day, and often dreamed about her at night, she did not see her.  The kids and the flowers were as much her delight as ever, and she made as much friendship with the miners" children she met on the mountain as Lootie would permit; but Lootie had very foolish notions concerning the dignity of a princess, not understanding that the truest princess is just the one who loves all her brothers and sisters best, and who is most able to do them good by being humble towards them.  At the same time she was considerably altered for the better in her behaviour to the princess.  She could not help seeing that she was no longer a mere child, but wiser than her age would account for.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1098'>Here I should like to remark, for the sake of princes and princesses in general, that it is a low and contemptible thing to refuse to confess a fault, or even an error.  If a true princess has done wrong, she is always uneasy until she has had an opportunity of throwing the wrongness away from her by saying: "I did it; and I wish I had not; and I am sorry for having done it." So you see there is some ground for supposing that Curdie was not a miner only, but a prince as well.  Many such instances have been known in the world"s history.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1099'>At length, however, he began to see signs of a change in the proceedings of the goblin excavators: they were going no deeper, but had commenced running on a level; and he watched them, therefore, more closely than ever.

Having reached its top, they went again on a level for a night or two, after which they began to ascend once more, and kept on at a pretty steep angle.  At length Curdie judged it time to transfer his observation to another quarter, and the next night he did not go to the mine at all; but, leaving his pickaxe and clue at home, and taking only his usual lumps of bread and pease pudding, went down the mountain to the king"s house.  He climbed over the wall, and remained in the garden the whole night, creeping on hands and knees from one spot to the other, and lying at full length with his ear to the ground, listening.  But he heard nothing except the tread of the men-at-arms as they marched about, whose observation, as the night was cloudy and there was no moon, he had little difficulty in avoiding.

He instantly squatted in the hope of eluding further notice.  But when he heard the sound of running feet, he jumped up to take the chance of escape by flight. He fell, however, with a keen shoot of pain, for the bolt of a crossbow had wounded his leg, and the blood was now streaming from it.

So, after they had brought him round a little, and attended to his wound, which was rather a bad one, they laid him, still exhausted from the loss of blood, upon a mattress in a disused room--one of those already so often mentioned--and locked the door, and left him.  He passed a troubled night, and in the morning they found him talking wildly.  In the evening he came to himself, but felt very weak, and his leg was exceedingly painful.  Wondering where he was, and seeing one of the men-at-arms in the room, he began to question him and soon recalled the events of the preceding night.  As he was himself unable to watch any more, he told the soldier all he knew about the goblins, and begged him to tell his companions, and stir them up to watch with tenfold vigilance; but whether it was that he did not talk quite coherently, or that the whole thing appeared incredible, certainly the man concluded that Curdie was only raving still, and tried to coax him into holding his tongue.  This, of course, annoyed Curdie dreadfully, who now felt in his turn what it was not to be believed, and the consequence was that his fever returned, and by the time when, at his persistent entreaties, the captain was called, there could be no doubt that he was raving.  They did for him what they could, and promised everything he wanted, but with no intention of fulfilment.

They all started up in affright, and rushing to the hall found the gentlemen-at-arms in consternation also. They had sent to wake their captain, who said from their description that it must have been an earthquake, an occurrence which, although very rare in that country, had taken place almost within the century; and then went to bed again, strange to say, and fell fast asleep without once thinking of Curdie, or associating the noises they had heard with what he had told them.  He had not believed Curdie.  If he had, he would at once have thought of what he had said, and would have taken precautions.  As they heard nothing more, they concluded that Sir Walter was right, and that the danger was over for perhaps another hundred years.

They, therefore, remained quiet for a while, and when they began to work again, they no doubt thought themselves very fortunate in coming upon a vein of sand which filled a winding fissure in the rock on which the house was built.

He thought he was ascending the Mountainside from the mouth of the mine, whistling and singing "Ring, dod, bang!" when he came upon a woman and child who had lost their way; and from that point he went on dreaming everything that had happened to him since he thus met the princess and Lootie; how he had watched the goblins, how he had been taken by them, how he had been rescued by the princess; everything, indeed, until he was wounded, captured, and imprisoned by the men-at-arms.

At length in an agony of despair, fancying he heard the goblins all over the house, he gave a great cry.  Then there came, as he thought, a hand upon the lock of his door.  It opened, and, looking up, he saw a lady with white hair, carrying a silver box in her hand, enter the room.  She came to his bed, he thought, stroked his head and face with cool, soft hands, took the dressing from his leg, rubbed it with something that smelt like roses, and then waved her hands over him three times.  At the last wave of her hands everything vanished, he felt himself sinking into the profoundest slumber, and remembered nothing more until he awoke in earnest.</paragraph>

Curdie went on stamping and slashing and singing, but saw nothing of the people of the house until he came to the great hall, in which, the moment he entered it, arose a great goblin shout. The last of the men-at-arms, the captain himself, was on the floor, buried beneath a wallowing crowd of goblins.  For, while each knight was busy defending himself as well as he could, by stabs in the thick bodies of the goblins, for he had soon found their heads all but invulnerable, the queen had attacked his legs and feet with her horrible granite shoe, and he was soon down; but the captain had got his back to the wall and stood out longer.

Her heart was quaking, however, and she kept moving about her skin-shod foot with nervous apprehension.  When Curdie was within a few paces, she rushed at him, made one tremendous stamp at his opposing foot, which happily he withdrew in time, and caught him round the waist, to dash him on the marble floor.  But just as she caught him, he came down with all the weight of his iron-shod shoe upon her skin-shod foot, and with a hideous howl she dropped him, squatted on the floor, and took her foot in both her hands.  Meanwhile the rest rushed on the king and the bodyguard, sent them flying, and lifted the prostrate captain, who was all but pressed to death.

The noise grew as his sharp ears guided him to a stair and so to the wine cellar.  It was full of goblins, whom the butler was supplying with wine as fast as he could draw it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1157'>While the queen and her party had encountered the men-at-arms, Harelip with another company had gone off to search the house.

The routed goblins, on their way below, joined them, and when Curdie entered they were all, with outstretched hands, in which were vessels of every description from sauce pan to silver cup, pressing around the butler, who sat at the tap of a huge cask, filling and filling.  Curdie cast one glance around the place before commencing his attack, and saw in the farthest corner a terrified group of the domestics unwatched, but cowering without courage to attempt their escape.

Without saying a word, for he knew no one would believe him any more than he had believed the princess, he followed the thread with his finger, contrived to give Lootie the slip, and was soon out of the house and on the mountainside--surprised that, if the thread were indeed the grandmother"s messenger, it should have led the princess, as he supposed it must, into the mountain, where she would be certain to meet the goblins rushing back enraged from their defeat.  But he hurried on in the hope of overtaking her first.  When he arrived, however, at the place where the path turned off for the mine, he found that the thread did not turn with it, but went straight up the mountain.  Could it be that the thread was leading him home to his mother"s cottage?  Could the princess be there?  He bounded up the mountain like one of its own goats, and before the sun was up the thread had brought him indeed to his mother"s door.  There it vanished from his fingers, and he could not find it, search as he might.</paragraph>

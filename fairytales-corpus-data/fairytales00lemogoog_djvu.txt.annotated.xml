His court swarmed  with comely and high-born pages, besides foot-  men and attendants in gorgeous liveries ; his  stables were filled with choice horses, and his  kennels with well-bred hounds. All this extra-  vagance consumed his treasures. He mortgaged  town after town, sold his jewels and plate, and  at last turned away his servants and shot his  dogs. Of all his property and wealth there  remained only a virtuous wife, three beautiful  daughters, and an old castle, situated close by  a forest. To this castle he retired, forsaken by  all the world. The Baroness, with the help of  her three daughters, was obliged to attend to all  the household matters, and a sad mess was  made of them. The Baron was dissatisfied with</paragraph>

One fine summer"s morning, in a fit  of spleen, he took up his hunting-spear and set out  for the wood, in hopes of killing a fallow deer, and  procuring for himself a more savoury meal. This  forest had long had the repute of being enchanted ;  many a traveller was known to have been, bewil-  dered in it, and some had never returned, having  either been strangled by malignant gnomes, or  torn in pieces by wild beasts. The Baron had  no faith in the invisible powers ; he went on  boldly, crossing hill and dale, and forcing his  way through bushes and thickets, but could start  no game. Finding himself weary he sat down  under a spacious oak, took a slice or two of  bread and a little salt out of his pocket, with the  intention of eating his dinner. Before he began  he chanced to lift up his eyes, when behold</paragraph>

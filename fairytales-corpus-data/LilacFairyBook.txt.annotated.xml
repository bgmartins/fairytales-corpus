	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='5'>"What cases are you engaged in at present?" "Are you stopping many teeth just now?" "What people have you converted lately?" Do ladies put these questions to the men--lawyers, dentists, clergymen, and so forth--who happen to sit next them at dinner parties?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='6'>I do not know whether ladies thus indicate their interest in the occupations of their casual neighbours at the hospitable board. But if they do not know me, or do not know me well, they generally ask "Are you writing anything now?" (as if they should ask a painter "Are you painting anything now?" or a lawyer "Have you any cases at present?"). Sometimes they are more definite and inquire "What are you writing now?" as if I must be writing something--which, indeed, is the case, though I dislike being reminded of it. It is an awkward question, because the fair being does not care a bawbee what I am writing; nor would she be much enlightened if I replied "Madam, I am engaged on a treatise intended to prove that Normal is prior to Conceptional Totemism"--though that answer would be as true in fact as obscure in significance. The best plan seems to be to answer that I have entirely abandoned mere literature, and am contemplating a book on "The Causes of Early Blight in the Potato," a melancholy circumstance which threatens to deprive us of our chief esculent root. The inquirer would never be undeceived. One nymph who, like the rest, could not keep off the horrid topic of my occupation, said "You never write anything but fairy books, do you?" A French gentleman, too, an educationist and expert in portraits of Queen Mary, once sent me a newspaper article in which he had written that I was exclusively devoted to the composition of fairy books, and nothing else. He then came to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='portrait' adjectives='' verbs='visit;come;find;do;know' valence='5.93888888889' arousal='4.01666666667' dominance='5.82333333333'>England</entity>, visited me, and found that I knew rather more about portraits of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='portrait' adjectives='' verbs='visit;come;find;do;know' valence='5.93888888889' arousal='4.01666666667' dominance='5.82333333333'>Queen Mary</entity> than he did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='7'>In truth I never did write any fairy books in my life, except "Prince Prigio," "Prince Ricardo," and "Tales from a Fairy Court"--that of the aforesaid Prigio. I take this opportunity of recommending these fairy books--poor things, but my own--to parents and guardians who may never have heard of them. They are rich in romantic adventure, and the Princes always marry the right Princesses and live happy ever afterwards; while the wicked witches, stepmothers, tutors and governesses are never cruelly punished, but retire to the country on ample pensions. I hate cruelty: I never put a wicked stepmother in a barrel and send her tobogganing down a hill. It is true that Prince Ricardo did kill the Yellow Dwarf; but that was in fair fight, sword in hand, and the dwarf, peace to his ashes! died in harness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='8'>The object of these confessions is not only that of advertising my own fairy books (which are not "out of print"; if your bookseller says so, the truth is not in him), but of giving credit where credit is due. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='work;book;language;mrs.' adjectives='other' verbs='be;translate;adapt;have' valence='6.001' arousal='3.68' dominance='6.052'>The fairy</entity> books have been almost wholly the work of Mrs. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='work;book;language;mrs.' adjectives='other' verbs='be;translate;adapt;have' valence='6.001' arousal='3.68' dominance='6.052'>Lang</entity>, who has translated and adapted them from the French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, and other languages.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='9'>My part has been that of Adam, according to Mark Twain, in the Garden of Eden. Eve worked, Adam superintended. I also superintend. I find out where the stories are, and advise, and, in short, superintend. I do not write the stories out of my own head. The reputation of having written all the fairy books (an European reputation in nurseries and the United States of America) is "the burden of an honour unto which I was not born." It weighs upon and is killing me, as the general fash of being the wife of the Lord of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lord;fash;maiden;wife' adjectives='much;general' verbs='peer;weigh;espouse;kill;be' valence='5.53142857143' arousal='3.99571428571' dominance='5.47642857143'>Burleigh</entity>, Burleigh House by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lord;fash;maiden;wife' adjectives='much;general' verbs='peer;weigh;espouse;kill;be' valence='5.53142857143' arousal='3.99571428571' dominance='5.47642857143'>Stamford Town</entity>, was too much for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lord;fash;maiden;wife' adjectives='much;general' verbs='peer;weigh;espouse;kill;be' valence='5.53142857143' arousal='3.99571428571' dominance='5.47642857143'>the village</entity> maiden espoused by that peer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='10'>Nobody really wrote most of the stories. People told them in all parts of the world long before Egyptian hieroglyphics or Cretan signs or Cyprian syllabaries, or alphabets were invented. They are older than reading and writing, and arose like wild flowers before men had any education to quarrel over. The grannies told them to the grandchildren, and when the grandchildren became grannies they repeated the same old tales to the new generation. Homer knew the stories and made up the "Odyssey" out of half a dozen of them. All the history of Greece till about 800 B.C. is a string of the fairy tales, all about Theseus and Heracles and Oedipus and Minos and Perseus is a Cabinet des Fes, a collection of fairy tales. Shakespeare took them and put bits of them into "King Lear" and other plays; he could not have made them up himself, great as he was. Let ladies and gentlemen think of this when they sit down to write fairy tales, and have them nicely typed, and send them to Messrs. Longman &amp; Co. to be published. They think that to write a new fairy tale is easy work. They are mistaken: the thing is impossible. Nobody can write a new fairy tale; you can only mix up and dress up the old, old stories, and put the characters into new dresses, as Miss Thackeray did so well in "Five Old Friends." If any big girl of fourteen reads this preface, let her insist on being presented with "Five Old Friends."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='11'>But the three hundred and sixty-five authors who try to write new fairy tales are very tiresome. They always begin with a little boy or girl who goes out and meets the fairies of polyanthuses and gardenias and apple blossoms: "Flowers and fruits, and other winged things." These fairies try to be funny, and fail; or they try to preach, and succeed. Real fairies never preach or talk slang. At the end, the little boy or girl wakes up and finds that he has been dreaming.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='13'>Our stories are almost all old, some from Ireland, before that island was as celebrated for her wrongs as for her verdure; some from Asia, made, I dare say, before the Aryan invasion; some from Moydart, Knoydart, Morar and Ardnamurchan, where the sea streams run like great clear rivers and the saw-edged hills are blue, and men remember Prince Charlie. Some are from Portugal, where the golden fruits grow in the Garden of the Hesperides; and some are from wild Wales, and were told at Arthur"s Court; and others come from the firesides of the kinsmen of the Welsh, the Bretons. There are also modern tales by a learned Scandinavian named <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tale' adjectives='modern' verbs='be;name;learn' valence='5.94166666667' arousal='4.12666666667' dominance='5.69'>Topelius</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='15'>It has been suggested to the Editor that children and parents and guardians would like "The Grey True Ghost-Story Book." He knows that the children would like it well, and he would gladly give it to them; but about the taste of fond anxious mothers and kind aunts he is not quite so certain. Before he was twelve the Editor knew true ghost stories enough to fill a volume. They were a pure joy till bedtime, but then, and later, were not wholly a source of unmixed pleasure. At that time the Editor was not afraid of the dark, for he thought, "If a ghost is here, we can"t see him." But when older and better informed persons said that ghosts brought their own light with them (which is too true), then one"s emotions were such as parents do not desire the young to endure.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>In the land of Erin there dwelt long ago a widow who had an only son. He was a clever boy, so she saved up enough money to send him to school, and, as soon as he was old enough, to apprentice him to any trade that he would choose. But when the time came, he said he would not be bound to any trade, and that he meant to be a thief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='56'>Now his mother was very sorrowful when she heard of this, but she knew quite well that if she tried to stop his having his own way he would only grow more determined to get it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>One day she was going to church to hear a sermon from a great preacher, and she begged the Shifty Lad, as the neighbours called him from the tricks he played, to come with her. But he only laughed and declared that he did not like sermons, adding:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>"However, I will promise you this, that the first trade you hear named after you come out from church shall be my trade for the rest of my life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>These words gave a little comfort to the poor woman, and her heart was lighter than before as she bade him farewell.</paragraph>

Robbery! Robbery!" The suddenness of it made her jump. The naughty boy had managed to change his voice, so that she did not know it for his, and he had concealed himself so well that, though she peered about all round her, she could see no one. As soon as she had turned the corner the Shifty Lad came out, and by running very fast through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lad;corner;shifty;mother;home' adjectives='contrived' verbs='run;stretch;reach;turn;have;come;find' valence='5.73214285714' arousal='4.10785714286' dominance='5.71714285714'>the wood</entity> he contrived to reach home before his mother, who found him stretched out comfortably before <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lad;corner;shifty;mother;home' adjectives='contrived' verbs='run;stretch;reach;turn;have;come;find' valence='5.73214285714' arousal='4.10785714286' dominance='5.71714285714'>the fire</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>"Oh, then no one has mentioned a trade to you?" he said in tones of disappointment.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>"Then your end will be hanging at the bridge of Dublin," said she. But there was no sleep for her that night, for she lay in the dark thinking about her son.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='67'>"If he is to be a thief at all, he had better be a good one. And who is there that can teach him?" the mother asked herself.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>"If he is clever, I don"t mind trying," answered the Black Gallows Bird; "and, of course, if ANY one can turn him into a first-rate thief, it is I. But if he is stupid, it is of no use at all; I can"t bear stupid people."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>"No, he isn"t stupid," said the woman with a sigh. "So to-night, after dark, I will send him to you."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>Every evening after dark the Shifty Lad went to the home of the Black Gallows Bird, and many were the new tricks he learned.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>"There is a rich farmer up there on the hill, who has just sold all his fat cattle for much money and has bought some lean ones which will cost him little.

To-morrow he will go to the market with the money in his hand, so to-night we must get at the chest. When all is quiet we will hide in the loft."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='75'>There was no moon, and it was the night of Hallowe"en, and everyone was burning nuts and catching apples in a tub of water with their hands tied, and playing all sorts of other games, till the Shifty Lad grew quite tired of waiting for them to get to bed. The Black Gallows Bird, who was more accustomed to the business, tucked himself up on the hay and went to sleep, telling the boy to wake him when the merry-makers had departed. But the Shifty Lad, who could keep still no longer, crept down to the cowshed and loosened the heads of the cattle which were tied, and they began to kick each other and bellow, and made such a noise that the company in the farmhouse ran out to tie them up again. Then the Shifty Lad entered the room and picked up a big handful of nuts, and returned to the loft, where the Black Rogue was still sleeping. At first the Shifty Lad shut his eyes too, but very soon he sat up, and taking a big needle and thread from his pocket, he sewed the hem of the Black Gallows Bird"s coat to a heavy piece of bullock"s hide that was hanging at his back.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>"He is stealing my hide!" shouted the farmer, and they all darted after him; but he was too swift for them, and at last he managed to tear the hide from his coat, and then he flew like a hare till he reached his old hiding-place. But all this took a long time, and meanwhile the Shifty Lad got down from the loft, and searched the house till he found the chest with the gold and silver in it, concealed behind a load of straw and covered with loaves of bread and a great cheese. The Shifty Lad slung the money bags round his shoulders and took the bread and the cheese under his arm, then set out quietly for the Black Rogue"s house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>"Here you are at last, you villain!" cried his master in great wrath. "But I will be revenged on you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>"It is all right," replied the Shifty Lad calmly. "I have brought what you wanted"; and he laid the things he was carrying down on the ground.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"Ah! you are the better thief," said the Black Rogue"s wife; and the Black Rogue added:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>"Yes, it is you who are the clever boy"; and they divided the spoil and the Black Gallows Bird had one half and the Shifty Lad the other half.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>A few weeks after that the Black Gallows Bird had news of a wedding that was to be held near the town; and the bridegroom had many friends and everybody sent him a present. Now a rich farmer who lived up near the moor thought that nothing was so useful to a young couple when they first began to keep house as a fine fat sheep, so he bade his shepherd go off to the mountain where the flock were feeding, and bring him back the best he could find. And the shepherd chose out the largest and fattest of the sheep and the one with the whitest fleece; then he tied its feet together and put it across his shoulder, for he had a long way to go.</paragraph>

The fame of such holiness as this soon spread, and daily the citizens would flock to see him, eager to get his blessing, to watch his devotions, or to hear his teaching, if he were in the mood to speak. Very soon the rajah himself heard of the jogi, and began regularly to visit him to seek his counsel and to ask his prayers that a son might be vouchsafed to him. Days passed by, and at last the rajah became so possessed with the thought of the holy man that he determined if possible to get him all to himself. So he built in the neighbourhood a little shrine, with a room or two added to it, and a small courtyard closely walled up; and, when all was ready, besought the jogi to occupy it, and to receive no other visitors except himself and his queen and such pupils as the jogi might choose, who would hand down his teaching.

The princess had of course heard of the holy man and of his miracles and his fasting, and she was filled with curiosity to see and to speak to him; but this was difficult, since she was not allowed to go out except into the palace grounds, and then was always closely guarded. However, at length she found an opportunity, and made her way one evening alone to the hermit"s shrine.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='202'>Unhappily, the hermit was not really as holy as he seemed; for no sooner did he see the princess than he fell in love with her wonderful beauty, and began to plot in his heart how he could win her for his wife. But the maiden was not only beautiful, she was also shrewd; and as soon as she read in the glance of the jogi the love that filled his soul, she sprang to her feet, and, gathering her veil about her, ran from the place as fast as she could. The jogi tried to follow, but he was no match for her; so, beside himself with rage at finding that he could not overtake her, he flung at her a lance, which wounded her in the leg. The brave princess stooped for a second to pluck the lance out of the wound, and then ran on until she found herself safe at home again. There she bathed and bound up the wound secretly, and told no one how naughty she had been, for she knew that her father would punish her severely.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='215'>Away hurried the king, and soon set all his soldiers scouring the country for a girl with a lance wound in her left. For two days the search went on, and then it was somehow discovered that the only person with a lance wound in the leg was the princess herself. The king, greatly agitated, went off to tell the jogi, and to assure him that there must be some mistake. But of course the jogi was prepared for this, and had his answer ready.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='6' num='216'>"She is not really your daughter, who was stolen away at her birth, but an evil spirit that has taken her form," said he solemnly. "You can do what you like, but if you don"t take my advice she will kill you all." And so solemn he appeared, and so unshaken in his confidence, that the king"s wisdom was blinded, and he declared that he would do whatever the jogi advised, and believe whatever he said. So the jogi directed him to send him secretly two carpenters; and when they arrived he set them to make a great chest, so cunningly jointed and put together that neither air nor water could penetrate it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='217'>As soon as the jogi got back from this deed he called two of his pupils, and pretended that it had been revealed to him that there should be found floating on the river a chest with something of great price within it; and he bade them go and watch for it at such a place far down the stream, and when the chest came slowly along, bobbing and turning in the tide, they were to seize it and secretly and swiftly bring it to him, for he was now determined to put the princess to death himself. The pupils set off at once, wondering at the strangeness of their errand, and still more at the holiness of the jogi to whom such secrets were revealed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='218'>It happened that, as the next morning was dawning, the gallant young prince of Dilaram was hunting by the banks of the river, with a great following of wazirs, attendants, and huntsmen, and as he rode he saw floating on the river a large chest, which came slowly along, bobbing and turning in the tide. Raising himself in his saddle, he gave an order, and half a dozen men plunged into the water and drew the chest out on to the river bank, where every one crowded around to see what it could contain. The prince was certainly not the least curious among them; but he was a cautious young man, and, as he prepared to open the chest himself, he bade all but a few stand back, and these few to draw their swords, so as to be prepared in case the chest should hold some evil beast, or djinn, or giant. When all were ready and expectant, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lid;life;dagger;maiden' adjectives='ready;lovely;open;expectant' verbs='breathe;be;force;fling;see;live;lay;have' valence='5.99058823529' arousal='4.14823529412' dominance='5.73705882353'>the prince</entity> with his dagger forced open the lid and flung it back, and there lay, living and breathing, the most lovely maiden he had ever seen in his life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='219'>Although she was half stifled from her confinement in the chest, the princess speedily revived, and, when she was able to sit up, the prince began to question her as to who she was and how she came to be shut up in the chest and set afloat upon the water; and she, blushing and trembling to find herself in the presence of so many strangers, told him that she was the princess of Rahmatabad, and that she had been put into the chest by her own father. When he on his part told her that he was the prince of Dilaram, the astonishment of the young people was unbounded to find that they, who had been betrothed without ever having seen one another, should have actually met for the first time in such strange circumstances. In fact, the prince was so moved by her beauty and modest ways that he called up his wazirs and demanded to be married at once to this lovely lady who had so completely won his heart. And married they were then and there upon the river bank, and went home to the prince"s palace, where, when the story was told, they were welcomed by the old rajah, the prince"s father, and the remainder of the day was given over to feasting and rejoicing. But when the banquet was over, the bride told her husband that now, on the threshold of their married life, she had more to relate of her adventures than he had given her the opportunity to tell as yet; and then, without hiding anything, she informed him of all that happened to her from the time she had stolen out to visit the wicked jogi.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='220'>In the morning the prince called his chief wazir and ordered him to shut up in the chest in which the princess had been found a great monkey that lived chained up in the palace, and to take the chest back to the river and set it afloat once more and watch what became of it. So the monkey was caught and put into the chest, and some of the prince"s servants took it down to the river and pushed it off into the water. Then they followed secretly a long way off to see what became of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='221'>Meanwhile the jogi"s two pupils watched and watched for the chest until they were nearly tired of watching, and were beginning to wonder whether the jogi was right after all, when on the second day they spied the great chest coming floating on the river, slowly bobbing and turning in the tide; and instantly a great joy and exultation seized them, for they thought that here indeed was further proof of the wonderful wisdom of their master. With some difficulty they secured the chest, and carried it back as swiftly and secretly as possible to the jogi"s house. As soon as they brought in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='chest;jogus' adjectives='impatient;outside;magic;cross' verbs='be;get;bring;have;put;go;open;tell' valence='5.64307692308' arousal='4.27153846154' dominance='5.49307692308'>the chest</entity>, the jogi, who had been getting very cross and impatient, told them to put it down, and to go outside whilst he opened the magic chest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='222'>"And even if you hear cries and sounds, however alarming, you must on no account enter," said the jogi, walking over to a closet where lay the silken cord that was to strangle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cord;account;jogus;closet' adjectives='silken;alarming' verbs='sound;be;cry;walk;say;hear;lay;enter;strangle' valence='5.54941176471' arousal='4.29235294118' dominance='5.44235294118'>the princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='223'>And the two pupils did as they were told, and went outside and shut close all the doors. Presently they heard a great outcry within and the jogi"s voice crying aloud for help; but they dared not enter, for had they not been told that whatever the noise, they must not come in? So they sat outside, waiting and wondering; and at last all grew still and quiet, and remained so for such a long time that they determined to enter and see if all was well. No sooner had they opened the door leading into the courtyard than they were nearly upset by a huge monkey that came leaping straight to the doorway and escaped past them into the open fields. Then they stepped into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='body;dwelling;jogus;s;threshold;piece' adjectives='' verbs='tear;lie;step;see' valence='4.784' arousal='4.022' dominance='5.308'>the room</entity>, and there they saw the jogi"s body lying torn to pieces on the threshold of his dwelling!</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='227'>The Heart of a Monkey</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='228'>A long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood in a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff. Of course the people had taken great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide which might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the town there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over the huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water. The branches of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='monkey;delight;fruit;branch;breakfast;sunrise' adjectives='big;topmost;grey;laden' verbs='be;see;chatter;have;sit' valence='6.26277777778' arousal='3.90722222222' dominance='5.77888888889'>the tree</entity> itself were laden with fruit, and every day at sunrise a big grey monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost branches having his breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='229'>After he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the monkey swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the water. While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might perch comfortably he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='230'>"Can I do anything for you, my friend?" asked the monkey politely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='231'>"Oh! if you only would thrown me down some of those delicious things, I should be so grateful," answered the shark. "After you have lived on fish for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change. And I am so very, very tired of the taste of salt."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='232'>"Well, I don"t like salt myself," said the monkey; "so if you will open your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it," and, as he spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head. But it was not so easy to hit the shark"s mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and rolled into the water. However, the second time the monkey had better luck, and the fruit fell right in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='233'>"Ah, how good!" cried the shark. "Send me another, please." And the monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='234'>"It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children," he said, at length, "but if you are here at the same time to-morrow I will give you another treat."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='235'>"Thank you, thank you," said the shark, showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight; "you can"t guess how happy you have made me," and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till the monkey came again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='236'>For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them. They became fast friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how to teach them all they ought to know. By and bye the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town, and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark. The shark perceived this very clearly, and described greater marvels, and the monkey as he listened grew more and more gloomy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='237'>Matters were in this state when one day the shark said: "I really hardly know how to thank you for all your kindness to me during these weeks. Here I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent to come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might happen to take your fancy."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='238'>"I should like nothing better," cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as they always did when he was pleased. "But how could I get there? Not by water. Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='239'>"Oh! don"t let that trouble you," replied the shark, "you have only to sit on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='240'>So it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark swam close up under the tree and the monkey dropped neatly on his back, without even a splash. After a few minutes--for at first he felt a little frightened at his strange position--the monkey began to enjoy himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish and the sea-weeds and the oddly-shaped things that floated past them, and as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='241'>The sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, "My friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I should tell you something."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='242'>"What is it?" asked the monkey. "Nothing unpleasant, I hope, for you sound rather grave?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='243'>"Oh, no! Nothing at all. It is only that shortly before we left I heard that the sultan of my country is very ill, and that the only thing to cure him is a monkey"s heart."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='244'>"Poor man, I am very sorry for him," replied the monkey; "but you were unwise not to tell me till we had started."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='245'>"What do you mean?" asked the shark; but the monkey, who now understood the whole plot, did not answer at once, for he was considering what he should say.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='246'>"Why are you so silent?" inquired the shark again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='247'>"I was thinking what a pity it was you did not tell me while I was still on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='248'>"Your heart! Why isn"t your heart here?" said the shark, with a puzzled expression.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='249'>"Oh, no! Of course not. Is it possible you don"t know that when we leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being troublesome? However, perhaps you won"t believe that, and will just think I have invented it because I am afraid, so let us go on to your country as fast as we can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you find it you can kill me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='250'>The monkey spoke in such a calm, indifferent way that the shark was quite deceived, and began to wish he had not been in such a hurry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='251'>"But there is no use going on if your heart is not with you," he said at last. "We had better turn back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='turn;fetch;have' valence='5.565' arousal='3.43166666667' dominance='5.72166666667'>the town</entity>, and then you can fetch it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='252'>Of course, this was just what the monkey wanted, but he was careful not to seem too pleased.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='253'>"Well, I don"t know," he remarked carelessly, "it is such a long way; but you may be right."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='254'>"I am sure I am," answered the shark, "and I will swim as quickly as I can," and so he did, and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree hanging over the water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='255'>With a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and swung himself up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='256'>"Wait for me here," he called out to the shark. "I am so hungry I must have a little breakfast, and then I will go and look for my heart," and he went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see him. Then he curled himself up and went to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='257'>"Are you there?" cried the shark, who was soon tired of swimming about under <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shark;haste' adjectives='tired' verbs='swim;be;cry;go' valence='5.248' arousal='4.443' dominance='4.938'>the cliff</entity>, and was in haste to be gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='258'>The monkey awoke with a start, but did not answer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='259'>"Are you there?" called the shark again, louder than before, and in a very cross voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='260'>"Oh, yes. I am here," replied the monkey; "but I wish you had not wakened me up. I was having such a nice nap."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='261'>"Have you got it?" asked the shark. "It is time we were going."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='262'>"Going where?" inquired the monkey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='263'>"Why, to my country, of course, with your heart. You CAN"T have forgotten!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='264'>"My dear friend," answered the monkey, with a chuckle, "I think you must be going a little mad. Do you take me for a washerman"s donkey?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='265'>"Don"t talk nonsense," exclaimed the shark, who did not like being laughed at. "What do you mean about a washerman"s donkey? And I wish you would be quick, or we may be too late to save the sultan."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='266'>"Did you really never hear of the washerman"s donkey?" asked the monkey, who was enjoying himself immensely. "Why, he is the beast who has no heart.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='267'>"Very well," said the shark sulkily, "if you won"t come, I suppose I may as well listen to that as do nothing."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='268'>So the monkey began.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='269'>"A washerman once lived in the great forest on the other side of the town, and he had a donkey to keep him company and to carry him wherever he wanted to go.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='286'>"Two or three weeks passed, and only bare places on the donkey"s back showed where the lion"s claws had been, while, on his side, the lion had recovered from his illness and was now as strong as ever.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='299'>""Thank you," replied the hare, balancing the donkey on her back as well as she was able, and though the legs trailed along the ground she managed to drag it to an open space some distance off, where she made a fire and roasted it.

The wife was a good wife enough, but her mind was all on her family and her farm, and she hardly ever went to her knees without falling asleep, and she thought the time spent in the chapel was twice as long as it need be. So, friends, she let her man and her two children go before her one day to Mass, while she called to consult a fairy man about a disorder one of her cows had. She was late at the chapel, and was sorry all the day after, for her husband was in grief about it, and she was very fond of him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='312'>Late that night he was wakened up by the cries of his children calling out "Mother! Mother!" When he sat up and rubbed his eyes, there was no wife by his side, and when he asked the little ones what was become of their mother, they said they saw the room full of nice little men and women, dressed in white and red and green, and their mother in the middle of them, going out by the door as if she was walking in her sleep. Out he ran, and searched everywhere round <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tale;tiding' adjectives='many;round' verbs='do;search;run;get' valence='6.011' arousal='3.814' dominance='5.523'>the house</entity> but, neither tale nor tidings did he get of her for many a day.</paragraph>

The infant was away with a nurse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='314'>About six weeks after--just as he was going out to his work one morning--a neighbour, that used to mind women when they were ill, came up to him, and kept step by step with him to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='neighbour;woman;work;step' adjectives='' verbs='be;use;mind;keep;go;come;tell' valence='5.83263157895' arousal='3.80578947368' dominance='5.63526315789'>the field</entity>, and this is what she told him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='315'>"Just as I was falling asleep last night, I heard a horse"s tramp on the grass and a knock at the door, and there, when I came out, was a fine-looking dark man, mounted on a black horse, and he told me to get ready in all haste, for a lady was in great want of me. As soon as I put on my cloak and things, he took me by the hand, and I was sitting behind him before I felt myself stirring. "Where are we going, sir?" says I. "You"ll soon know," says he; and he drew his fingers across my eyes, and not a ray could I see. I kept a tight grip of him, and I little knew whether he was going backwards or forwards, or how long we were about it, till my hand was taken again, and I felt the ground under me. The fingers went the other way across my eyes, and there we were before a castle door, and in we went through a big hall and great rooms all painted in fine green colours, with red and gold bands and ornaments, and the finest carpets and chairs and tables and window curtains, and grand ladies and gentlemen walking about. At last we came to a bedroom, with a beautiful lady in bed, with a fine bouncing boy beside her. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='baby;ointment;child;bottle;hand' adjectives='green' verbs='kiss;give;rub;praise;come;clap' valence='6.12388888889' arousal='4.50944444444' dominance='5.62111111111'>The lady</entity> clapped her hands, and in came the Dark Man and kissed her and the baby, and praised me, and gave me a bottle of green ointment to rub the child all over.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='316'>"Well, the child I rubbed, sure enough; but my right eye began to smart, and I put up my finger and gave it a rub, and then stared, for never in all my life was I so frightened. The beautiful room was a big, rough cave, with water oozing over the edges of the stones and through the clay; and the lady, and the lord, and the child weazened, poverty-bitten creatures--nothing but skin and bone--and the rich dresses were old rags. I didn"t let on that I found any difference, and after a bit says the Dark Man, "Go before me to the hall door, and I will be with you in a few moments, and see you safe home." Well, just as I turned into the outside cave, who should I see watching near the door but poor Molly. She looked round all terrified, and says she to me in a whisper, "I"m brought here to nurse the child of the king and queen of the fairies; but there is one chance of saving me. All the court will pass the cross near Templeshambo next Friday night, on a visit to the fairies of Old Ross. If John can catch me by the hand or cloak when I ride by, and has courage not to let go his grip, I"ll be safe. Here"s the king. Don"t open your mouth to answer. I saw what happened with the ointment."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='317'>"The Dark Man didn"t once cast his eye towards Molly, and he seemed to have no suspicion of me. When we came out I looked about me, and where do you think we were but in the dyke of the Rath of Cromogue. I was on the horse again, which was nothing but a big rag-weed, and I was in dread every minute I"d fall off; but nothing happened till I found myself in my own cabin. The king slipped five guineas into my hand as soon as I was on the ground, and thanked me, and bade me good night. I hope I"ll never see his face again.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='318'>Well, you may all think the fright, and the joy, and the grief the poor man was in when the woman finished her story.

He looked, but could see nothing; and she stood trembling and her eyes wide open, looking down the way to the ford of Ballinacoola. "I see your wife," says she, "riding on the outside just so as to rub against us. We"ll walk on quietly, as if we suspected nothing, and when we are passing I"ll give you a shove. If you don"t do YOUR duty then, woe be with you!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='320'>Well, they walked on easy, and the poor hearts beating in both their breasts; and though he could see nothing, he heard a faint jingle and trampling and rustling, and at last he got the push that she promised. He spread out his arms, and there was his wife"s waist within them, and he could see her plain; but such a hullabulloo rose as if there was an earthquake, and he found himself surrounded by horrible-looking things, roaring at him and striving to pull his wife away. But he made the sign of the cross and bid them begone in God"s name, and held his wife as if it was iron his arms were made of. Bedad, in one moment everything was as silent as the grave, and the poor woman lying in a faint in the arms of her husband and her good neighbour. Well, all in good time she was minding her family and her business again; and I"ll go bail, after the fright she got, she spent more time on her knees, and avoided fairy men all the days of the week, and particularly on Sunday.</paragraph>

"Oh, sir," says she, very foolish, "I hope your lady is well, and the baby." "Pretty well, thank you," says he, rather frightened like. "How do I look in this new suit?" says he, getting to one side of her. "I can"t see you plain at all, sir," says she. "Well, now?" says he, getting round her back to the other side. "Musha, indeed, sir, your coat looks no better than a withered dock-leaf." "Maybe, then," says he, "it will be different now," and he struck the eye next him with a switch.

Their beds were so comfortable, they could hardly make up their minds to get up, their clothes were so lovely they could scarcely bring themselves to take them off; their dinners were so good that they found it very difficult to leave off eating. Then outside the palace were gardens filled with rare flowers and fruits and singing birds, or if they desired to go further, a golden coach, painted with wreaths of forget-me-nots and lined with blue satin, awaited their orders.

"It is no affair of ours," and the conversation dropped once more, but as time went on, the woman spoke less and less, and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite frightened about her.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='349'>"My dear wife," said the man at last, "you really must eat something. What in the world is the matter with you? If you go on like this you will die."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>Walter is six years old, and he must soon begin to go to school. He cannot read yet, but he can do many other things. He can turn cartwheels, stand on his head, ride see-saw, throw snowballs, play ball, crow like a cock, eat bread and butter and drink sour milk, tear his trousers, wear holes in his elbows, break the crockery in pieces, throw balls through the windowpanes, draw old men on important papers, walk over the flower-beds, eat himself sick with gooseberries, and be well after a whipping. For the rest he has a good heart but a bad memory, and forgets his father"s and his mother"s admonitions, and so often gets into trouble and meets with adventures, as you shall hear, but first of all I must tell you how brave he was and how he hunted wolves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='367'>Once in the spring, a little before Midsummer, Walter heard that there were a great many wolves in the wood, and that pleased him. He was wonderfully brave when he was in the midst of his companions or at home with his brothers and sister, then he used often to say "One wolf is nothing, there ought to be at least four."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='368'>When he wrestled with Klas Bogenstrom or Frithiof Waderfelt and struck them in the back, he would say "That is what I shall do to a wolf!" and when he shot arrows at <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='coat;sheepskin;wolf;arrow' adjectives='' verbs='shoot;rattle;say;be' valence='5.14666666667' arousal='4.52666666667' dominance='5.29083333333'>Jonas</entity> and they rattled against his sheepskin coat he would say: "That is how I should shoot you if you were a wolf!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='369'>Indeed, some thought that the brave boy boasted a little; but one must indeed believe him since he said so himself. So Jonas and Lena used to say of him "Look, there goes Walter, who shoots the wolves." And other boys and girls would say "Look, there goes brave <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boy;girl' adjectives='other' verbs='be;brave;look;fight;say;go' valence='6.01916666667' arousal='4.39416666667' dominance='5.85916666667'>Walter</entity>, who is brave enough to fight with four."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='370'>There was no one so fully convinced of this as Walter himself, and one day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt. He took with him his drum, which had holes in one end since the time he had climbed up on it to reach a cluster of rowan berries, and his tin sabre, which was a little broken, because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a whole unfriendly army of gooseberry bushes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='371'>He did not forget to arm himself quite to the teeth with his pop-gun, his bow, and his air-pistol. He had a burnt cork in his pocket to blacken his moustache, and a red cock"s feather to put in his cap to make himself look fierce. He had besides in his trouser pocket a clasp knife with a bone handle, to cut off the ears of the wolves as soon as he had killed them, for he thought it would be cruel to do that while they were still living.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='372'>It was such a good thing that Jonas was going with corn to the mill, for Walter got a seat on the load, while Caro ran barking beside them. As soon as they came to the wood Walter looked cautiously around him to see perchance there was a wolf in the bushes, and he did not omit to ask Jonas if wolves were afraid of a drum. "Of course they are" (that is understood) said Jonas.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='377'>"Oh, it is all the same," said Walter.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>"No, it is better for you to come too," said Walter. "Perhaps there are many."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='381'>"No, I have not time," said Jonas, "and besides, there are sure not to be more than three. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='manage' valence='4.99' arousal='3.55333333333' dominance='5.60666666667'>Walter</entity> can manage them very well alone."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='382'>"Yes," said Walter, "certainly I could; but, you see, Jonas, it might happen that one of them might bite me in the back, and I should have more trouble in killing them. If I only knew that there were not more than two I should not mind, for them I should take one in each hand and give them a good shaking, like <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hand' adjectives='good;more' verbs='be;give;mind;know;shake;take' valence='5.88529411765' arousal='4.36764705882' dominance='5.57882352941'>Susanna</entity> once shook me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='383'>"I certainly think that there will not be more than two," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ram;child' adjectives='more' verbs='be;say;shake;think;slay' valence='5.51642857143' arousal='4.10214285714' dominance='5.75071428571'>Jonas</entity>, "there are never more than two when they slay children and rams; <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ram;child' adjectives='more' verbs='be;say;shake;think;slay' valence='5.51642857143' arousal='4.10214285714' dominance='5.75071428571'>Walter</entity> can very well shake them without me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='384'>"But, you see, Jonas," said Walter, "if there are two, it might still happen that one of them escapes and bites me in the leg, for you see I am not so strong in the left hand as in the right. You can very well come with me, and take a good stick in case there are really two. Look, if there is only one, I shall take him so with both my hands and thrown him living on to his back, and he can kick as much as he likes, I shall hold him fast."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='385'>"Now, when I really think over the thing," said Jonas, "I am almost sure there will not be more than one. What would two do with one ram? There will certainly not be more than one."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>"But you should come with me all the same, Jonas," said Walter. "You see I can very well manage one, but I am not quite accustomed to wolves yet, and he might tear holes in my new trousers."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='387'>"Well, just listen," said Jonas, "I am beginning to think that Walter is not so brave as people say. First of all Walter would fight against four, and then against three, then two, and then one, and now Walter wants help with one. Such a thing must never be; what would people say? Perhaps they would think that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='coward' adjectives='' verbs='be;think' valence='5.238' arousal='4.016' dominance='5.406'>Walter</entity> is a coward?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='388'>"That"s a lie," said Walter, "I am not at all frightened, but it is more amusing when there are two. I only want someone who will see how I strike the wolf and how the dust flies out of his skin."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='389'>"Well, then, Walter can take the miller"s little Lisa with him. She can sit on a stone and look on," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stone' adjectives='' verbs='say;look;sit' valence='5.65' arousal='3.795' dominance='6.25333333333'>Jonas</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='390'>"No, she would certainly be frightened," said Walter, "and how would it do for a girl to go wolf-hunting? Come with me, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tail;ear;skin' adjectives='content' verbs='be;come;have' valence='5.68181818182' arousal='3.64818181818' dominance='5.69454545455'>Jonas</entity>, and you shall have the skin, and I will be content with the ears and the tail."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='391'>"No, thank you," said Jonas, "Walter can keep the skin for himself. Now I see quite well that he is frightened. Fie, shame on him!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='392'>This touched Walter"s pride very near. "I shall show that I am not frightened," he said; and so he took his drum, sabre, cock"s feather, clasp-knife, pop-gun and air-pistol, and went off quite alone to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hunt;clasp-knife;s;wolf;air-pistol;feather' adjectives='pop-gun' verbs='be;drum;show;frighten;say;take;go;sabre;cock' valence='5.27176470588' arousal='4.53058823529' dominance='5.30529411765'>the wood</entity> to hunt wolves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='393'>It was a beautiful evening, and the birds were singing in all the branches. Walter went very slowly and cautiously. At every step he looked all round him to see if perchance there was anything lurking behind the stones. He quite thought something moved away there in the ditch. Perhaps it was a wolf. "It is better for me to beat the drum a little before I go there," thought <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='little' verbs='beat;be;drum;think;go' valence='5.62222222222' arousal='4.64888888889' dominance='5.37777777778'>Walter</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='394'>Br-r-r, so he began to beat his drum. Then something moved again. Caw! caw! a crow flew up from the ditch. Walter immediately regained courage. "It was well I took my drum with me," he thought, and went straight on with courageous steps. Very soon he came quite close to the kiln, where the wolves had killed the ram. But the nearer he came the more dreadful he thought the kiln looked. It was so gray and old. Who knew how many wolves there might be hidden there? Perhaps the very ones which killed the ram were still sitting there in a corner. Yes, it was not at all safe here, and there were no other people to be seen in the neighbourhood. It would be horrible to be eaten up here in the daylight, thought <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='food;wolf;kiln' adjectives='dreadful;old;uglier;horrible;grayer;more' verbs='be;look;think;become;seem;eat' valence='5.486875' arousal='4.291875' dominance='5.4725'>Walter</entity> to himself; and the more he thought about it the uglier and grayer the old kiln looked, and the more horrible and dreadful it seemed to become the food of wolves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='395'>"Shall I go back and say that I struck one wolf and it escaped?" thought Walter. "Fie!" said his conscience, "Do you not remember that a lie is one of the worst sins, both in the sight of God and man? If you tell a lie to-day and say you struck a wolf, to-morrow surely it will eat you up."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='396'>"No, I will go to the kiln," thought Walter, and so he went. But he did not go quite near. He went only so near that he could see the ram"s blood which coloured the grass red, and some tufts of wool which the wolves had torn from the back of the poor animal.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='397'>It looked so dreadful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='398'>"I wonder what the ram thought when they ate him up," thought <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ram;boot;collar' adjectives='cold' verbs='shiver;run;think;eat;wonder' valence='5.70538461538' arousal='4.37461538462' dominance='5.52230769231'>Walter</entity> to himself; and just then a cold shiver ran through him from his collar right down to his boots.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='399'>"It is better for me to beat the drum," he thought to himself again, and so he began to beat it. But it sounded horrid, and an echo came out from the kiln that seemed almost like the howl of a wolf. The drumsticks stiffened in <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='drumstick;s;hand' adjectives='' verbs='stiffen;be;come;think' valence='5.896' arousal='4.028' dominance='5.694'>Walter</entity>"s hands, and he thought now they are coming...!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='400'>Yes, sure enough, just then a shaggy, reddish-brown wolf"s head looked out from under the kiln!</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='402'>But, alas! the wolf ran after him. Walter looked back; the wolf was quicker than he and only a few steps behind him. Then Walter ran faster. But fear got the better of him, he neither heard nor saw anything more. He ran over sticks, stones and ditches; he lost drum-sticks, sabre, bow, and air-pistol, and in his terrible hurry he tripped over a tuft of grass.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='403'>It was a gruesome tale! Now you may well believe that it was all over with Walter and all his adventures. That would have been a pity.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='558'>There was once a king who had three daughters. The two eldest were very proud and quarrelsome, but the youngest was as good as they were bad. Well, three princes came to court them, and two of them were exactly like the eldest ladies, and one was just as lovable as the youngest. One day they were all walking down to a lake that lay at the bottom of the lawn when they met a poor beggar. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wouldn;sweetheart;daughter;anything;word;kind;t;love;princess;something' adjectives='youngest;better;true;eldest' verbs='wouldn;be;do;give' valence='6.80333333333' arousal='4.57333333333' dominance='5.924'>The king</entity> wouldn"t give him anything, and the eldest princesses wouldn"t give him anything, nor their sweethearts; but the youngest daughter and her true love did give him something, and kind words along with it, and that was better than all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='559'>When they got to the edge of the lake what did they find but the beautifullest boat you ever saw in your life; and says the eldest, "I"ll take a sail in this fine boat"; and says the second eldest, "I"ll take a sail in this fine boat"; and says the youngest, "I won"t take a sail in that fine boat, for I am afraid it"s an enchanted one." But the others persuaded her to go in, and her father was just going in after her, when up sprung on the deck a little man only seven inches high, and ordered him to stand back. Well, all the men put their hands to their swords; and if the same swords were only playthings, they weren"t able to draw them, for all strength that was left their arms. Seven Inches loosened the silver chain that fastened the boat, and pushed away, and after grinning at the four men, says he to them. "Bid your daughters and your brides farewell for awhile. You," says he to the youngest, "needn"t fear, you"ll recover your princess all in good time, and you and she will be as happy as the day is long. Bad people, if they were rolling stark naked in gold, would not be rich. Good-bye." Away they sailed, and the ladies stretched out their hands, but weren"t able to say a word.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='560'>Well, they weren"t crossing the lake while a cat "ud be lickin" her ear, and the poor men couldn"t stir hand or foot to follow them. They saw Seven Inches handing the three princesses out of the boat, and letting them down by a basket into a draw-well, but king nor princes ever saw an opening before in the same place. When the last lady was out of sight, the men found the strength in their arms and legs again. Round the lake they ran, and never drew rein till they came to the well and windlass; and there was the silk rope rolled on the axle, and the nice white basket hanging to it. "Let me down," says the youngest prince. "I"ll die or recover them again." "No," says the second daughter"s sweetheart, "it is my turn first." And says the other, "I am the eldest." So they gave way to him, and in he got into the basket, and down they let him. First they lost sight of him, and then, after winding off a hundred perches of the silk rope, it slackened, and they stopped turning. They waited two hours, and then they went to dinner, because there was no pull made at the rope.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='561'>Guards were set till next morning, and then down went the second prince, and sure enough, the youngest of all got himself let down on the third day. He went down perches and perches, while it was as dark about him as if he was in a big pot with a cover on. At last he saw a glimmer far down, and in a short time he felt the ground. Out he came from the big lime-kiln, and, lo! and behold you, there was a wood, and green fields, and a castle in a lawn, and a bright sky over all. "It"s in Tir-na-n-Oge I am," says he. "Let"s see what sort of people are in the castle." On he walked, across fields and lawn, and no one was there to keep him out or let him into the castle; but the big hall-door was wide open. He went from one fine room to another that was finer, and at last he reached the handsomest of all, with a table in the middle. And such a dinner as was laid upon it! The prince was hungry enough, but he was too mannerly to eat without being invited. So he sat by the fire, and he did not wait long till he heard steps, and in came Seven Inches with the youngest sister by the hand. Well, prince and princess flew into one another"s arms, and says the little man, says he, "Why aren"t you eating?" "I think, sir," says the prince, "it was only good manner to wait to be asked." "The other princes didn"t think so," says he. "Each o" them fell to without leave, and only gave me the rough words when I told them they were making more free than welcome. Well, I don"t think they feel much hunger now. There they are, good marble instead of flesh and blood," says he, pointing to two statues, one in one corner, and the other in the other corner of the room. The prince was frightened, but he was afraid to say anything, and Seven Inches made him sit down to dinner between himself and his bride; and he"d be as happy as the day is long, only for the sight of the stone men in the corner. Well, that day went by, and when the next came, says Seven Inches to him, "Now, you"ll have to set out that way," pointing to the sun, "and you"ll find the second princess in a giant"s castle this evening, when you"ll be tired and hungry, and the eldest princess to-morrow evening; and you may as well bring them here with you. You need not ask leave of their masters; and perhaps if they ever get home, they"ll look on poor people as if they were flesh and blood like themselves."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='562'>Away went the prince, and bedad! it"s tired and hungry he was when he reached the first castle, at sunset. Oh, wasn"t the second princess glad to see him! And what a good supper she gave him. But she heard the giant at the gate, and she hid the prince in a closet. Well, when he came in, he snuffed, an" he snuffed, and says he, "By the life, I smell fresh meat." "Oh," says the princess, "it"s only the calf I got killed to-day." "Ay, ay," says he, "is supper ready?" "It is," says she; and before he rose from the table he ate three-quarters of a calf, and a flask of wine. "I think," says he, when all was done, "I smell fresh meat still." "It"s sleepy you are," says she; "go to bed." "When will you marry me?" says the giant. "You"re putting me off too long." "St. Tibb"s Eve," says she. "I wish I knew how far off that is," says he; and he fell asleep, with his head in the dish.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='563'>Next day, he went out after breakfast, and she sent the prince to the castle where the eldest sister was. The same thing happened there; but when the giant was snoring, the princess wakened up the prince, and they saddled two steeds in the stables and rode into the field on them. But the horses" heels struck the stones outside the gate, and up got the giant and strode after them. He roared and he shouted, and the more he shouted, the faster ran the horses, and just as the day was breaking he was only twenty perches behind. But the prince didn"t leave the castle of Seven Inches without being provided with something good. He reined in his steed, and flung a short, sharp knife over his shoulder, and up sprung a thick wood between the giant and themselves. They caught the wind that blew before them, and the wind that blew behind them did not catch them. At last they were near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='steed;sister;hedge' adjectives='high;fine;other;last' verbs='be;live;wait' valence='5.925' arousal='4.05' dominance='5.68666666667'>the castle</entity> where the other sister lived; and there she was, waiting for them under a high hedge, and a fine steed under her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='564'>But the giant was now in sight, roaring like a hundred lions, and the other giant was out in a moment, and the chase kept on. For every two springs the horses gave, the giants gave three, and at last they were only seventy perches off. Then the prince stopped again, and flung the second knife behind him. Down went all the flat field, till there was a quarry between them a quarter of a mile deep, and the bottom filled with black water; and before the giants could get round it, the prince and princesses were inside the kingdom of the great magician, where the high thorny hedge opened of itself to everyone that he chose to let in. There was joy enough between the three sisters, till the two eldest saw their lovers turned into stone. But while they were shedding tears for them, Seven Inches came in, and touched them with his rod. So they were flesh, and blood, and life once more, and there was great hugging and kissing, and all sat down to breakfast, and Seven Inches sat at the head of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='life;flesh;head;hugging;blood;inch;kissing;breakfast' adjectives='great' verbs='be;sit' valence='5.83846153846' arousal='4.02923076923' dominance='5.63230769231'>the table</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='565'>When breakfast was over, he took them into another room, where there was nothing but heaps of gold, and silver, and diamonds, and silks, and satins; and on a table there was lying three sets of crowns: a gold crown was in a silver crown, and that was lying in a copper crown. He took up one set of crowns, and gave it to the eldest princess; and another set, and gave it to the second youngest princess; and another, and gave it to the youngest of all; and says he, "Now you may all go to the bottom of the pit, and you have nothing to do but stir the basket, and the people that are watching above will draw you up. But remember, ladies, you are to keep your crows safe, and be married in them, all the same day. If you be married separately, or if you be married without your crowns, a curse will follow--mind what I say."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='566'>So they took leave of him with great respect, and walked arm-in-arm to the bottom of the draw-well. There was a sky and a sun over them, and a great high wall, covered with ivy, rose before them, and was so high they could not see to the top of it; and there was an arch in this wall, and the bottom of the draw-well was inside the arch. The youngest pair went last; and says the princess to the prince, "I"m sure the two princes don"t mean any good to you. Keep these crowns under your cloak, and if you are obliged to stay last, don"t get into the basket, but put a big stone, or any heavy thing inside, and see what will happen."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='567'>As soon as they were inside the dark cave, they put in the eldest princess first, and stirred the basket, and up she went. Then the basket was let down again, and up went the second princess, and then up went the youngest; but first she put her arms round her prince"s neck, and kissed him, and cried a little. At last it came to the turn of the youngest prince, and instead of going into the basket he put in a big stone. He drew on one side and listened, and after the basket was drawn up about twenty perches, down came it and the stone like thunder, and the stone was broken into little bits.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='568'>Well, the poor prince had nothing for it but to walk back to the castle; and through it and round it he walked, and the finest of eating and drinking he got, and a bed of bog-down to sleep on, and long walks he took through gardens and lawns, but not a sight could he get, high or low, of Seven Inches. He, before a week, got tired of it, he was so lonesome for his true love; and at the end of a month he didn"t know what to do with himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='569'>One morning he went into the treasure room, and took notice of a beautiful snuff-box on the table that he didn"t remember seeing there before. He took it in his hands and opened it, and out Seven Inches walked on the table. "I think, prince," says he, "you"re getting a little tired of my castle?" "Ah!" says the other, "if I had my princess here, and could see you now and then, I"d never know a dismal day." "Well, you"re long enough here now, and you"re wanted there above. Keep your bride"s crowns safe, and whenever you want my help, open this snuff-box. Now take a walk down <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='walk' adjectives='tired' verbs='come;take' valence='5.50428571429' arousal='3.75714285714' dominance='5.43'>the garden</entity>, and come back when you"re tired."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='570'>The prince was going down a gravel walk with a quickset hedge on each side, and his eyes on the ground, and he was thinking of one thing and another. At last he lifted his eyes, and there he was outside of a smith"s gate that he often passed before, about a mile away from the palace of his betrothed princess. The clothes he had on him were as ragged as you please, but he had his crowns safe under his old cloak.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='571'>Then the smith came out, and says he, "It"s a shame for a strong, big fellow like you to be lazy, and so much work to be done. Are you any good with hammer and tongs? Come in and bear a hand, an I"ll give you diet and lodging, and a few pence when you earn them." "Never say"t twice," says the prince. "I want nothing but to be busy." So he took the hammer, and pounded away at the red-hot bar that the smith was turning on the anvil to make into a set of horse-shoes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='572'>They hadn"t been long at work when a tailor came in, and he sat down and began to talk. "You all heard how the two princess were loth to be married till the youngest would be ready with her crowns and her sweetheart. But after the windlass loosened accidentally when they were pulling up her bridegroom that was to be, there was no more sign of a well, or a rope, or a windlass, than there is on the palm of your hand. So the princes that were courting the eldest ladies wouldn"t give peace or ease to their lovers nor the king till they got consent to the marriage, and it was to take place this morning. Myself went down out o" curiousity, and to be sure I was delighted with the grand dresses of the two brides, and the three crowns on their heads--gold, silver, and copper, one inside the other. The youngest was standing by mournful enough, and all was ready. The two bridegrooms came in as proud and grand as you please, and up they were walking to the altar rails, when the boards opened two yards wide under their feet, and down they went among the dead men and the coffins in the vaults. Oh, such shrieks as the ladies gave! and such running and racing and peeping down as there was! but the clerk soon opened <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mould;clerk;cobweb;inch;prince;clothes' adjectives='thick;fine' verbs='come;open;cover' valence='5.50071428571' arousal='3.70785714286' dominance='5.40214285714'>the door</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mould;clerk;cobweb;inch;prince;clothes' adjectives='thick;fine' verbs='come;open;cover' valence='5.50071428571' arousal='3.70785714286' dominance='5.40214285714'>the vault</entity>, and up came the two princes, their fine clothes covered an inch thick with cobwebs and mould.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='573'>So the king said they should put off the marriage. "For," says he, "I see there is no use in thinking of it till the youngest gets her three crowns, and is married with the others. I"ll give my youngest daughter for a wife to whoever brings three crowns to me like the others; and if he doesn"t care to be married, some other one will, and I"ll make his fortune."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='574'>"I wish," says the smith, "I could do it; but I was looking at the crowns after the princesses got home, and I don"t think there"s a black or a white smith on the face of the earth that could imitate them." "Faint heart never won fair lady," says the prince. "Go to the palace and ask for a quarter of a pound of gold, a quarter of a pound of silver, and a quarter of a pound of copper. Get one crown for a pattern, and my head for a pledge, I"ll give you out the very things that are wanted in the morning." "Are you in earnest?" says the smith. "Faith, I am so," says he. "Go! you can"t do worse than lose."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='575'>To make a long story short, the smith got the quarter of a pound of gold, and the quarter of a pound of silver, and the quarter of a pound of copper, and gave them and the pattern crown to the prince.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='576'>Well, just as the sun was thinking to rise, he opened the door, and brought out the three crowns he got from his true love, and such shouting and huzzaing as there was! The smith asked him to go along with him to the palace, but he refused; so off set the smith, and the whole townland with him; and wasn"t the king rejoiced when he saw the crowns! "Well," says he to the smith, "you"re a married man. What"s to be done?" "Faith, your majesty, I didn"t make them crowns at all. It was a big fellow that took service with me yesterday." "Well, daughter, will you marry the fellow that made these crowns?" "Let me see them first, father," said she; but when she examined them she knew them right well, and guessed it was her true love that sent them. "I will marry <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='crown' adjectives='' verbs='marry;come;say' valence='5.76857142857' arousal='4.32857142857' dominance='5.88'>the man</entity> that these crowns came from," says she.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='577'>"Well," says the king to the elder of the two princes, "go up to the smith"s forge, take my best coaches, and bring home the bridegroom." He did not like doing this, he was so proud, but he could not refuse. When he came to the forge he saw the prince standing at the door, and beckoned him over to the coach. "Are you the fellow," says he, "that made these crowns?" "Yes," says the other. "Then," says he, "maybe you"d give yourself a brushing, and get into that coach; the king wants to see you. I pity the princess." The young prince got into the carriage, and while they were on the way he opened the snuff-box, and out walked Seven Inches, and stood on his thigh. "Well," says he, "what trouble is on you now?" "Master," says the other, "please let me go back to my forge, and let this carriage be filled with paving stones." No sooner said than done. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;carriage' adjectives='' verbs='forge;be;happen;wonder;sit' valence='5.88333333333' arousal='3.76111111111' dominance='5.63111111111'>The prince</entity> was sitting in his forge, and the horses wondered what was after happening to the carriage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='578'>When they came into the palace yard, the king himself opened the carriage door, for respect to his new son-in-law. As soon as he turned the handle, a shower of small stones fell on his powdered wig and his silk coat, and down he fell under them. There was great fright and some laughter, and the king, after he wiped the blood from his forehead, looked very cross at the eldest prince. "My lord," says he, "I"m very sorry for this accident, but I"m not to blame. I saw the young smith get into the carriage, and we never stopped a minute since." "It"s uncivil you were to him. Go," says he to the other prince, "and bring the young smith here, and be polite." "Never fear," says he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='579'>But there"s some people that couldn"t be good-natured if they tried, and not a bit civiller was the new messenger than the old, and when the king opened the carriage door a second time, it"s shower of mud that came down on him. "There"s no use," says he, "going on this way. The fox never got a better messenger than himself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='580'>So he changed his clothes, and washed himself, and out he set to the prince"s forge and asked him to sit along with himself. The prince begged to be allowed to sit in the other carriage, and when they were half-way he opened his snuff-box. "Master," says he, "I"d wish to be dressed now according to my rank." "You shall be that," says Seven Inches. "And now I"ll bid you farewell. Continue as good and kind as you always were; love your wife; and that"s all the advice I"ll give you."

Before he had finished it began to rain heavily, so he hid himself in the hollow trunk of a tree, where he was so dry and comfortable that he soon fell fast asleep. By and by he was awakened by a noise which sounded like a dog scratching at the door, and he suddenly felt frightened, why he did not know. Very cautiously he raised his head, and right above him he saw a big hairy animal, coming down tail foremost.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='588'>"It is the wolf that they talk so much about," he said to himself, and he made himself as small as he could and shrunk into a corner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='589'>The wolf came down the inside of the tree, slowly, slowly; Antoine felt turned to stone, so terrified was he, and hardly dared to breathe. Suddenly an idea entered his mind, which he thought might save him still. He remembered to have heard from his mother that a wolf could neither bend his back nor turn his head, so as to look behind him, and quick as lightning he stretched up his hand, and seizing the wolf"s tail, pulled it towards him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='590'>Then he left <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='house;s;animal;mother' adjectives='' verbs='leave;drag' valence='6.10428571429' arousal='4.27714285714' dominance='5.69285714286'>the tree</entity> and dragged the animal to his mother"s house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='591'>"Mother, you have often declared that I was too stupid to catch a wolf by the tail. Now see," he cried triumphantly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='592'>"Well, well, wonders will never cease," answered the good woman, who took care to keep at a safe distance. "But as you really have got him, let us see if we can"t put him to some use. Fetch the skin of the ram which died last week out of the chest, and we will sew the wolf up in it. He will make a splendid ram, and to-morrow we will drive him to the fair and sell him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='593'>Very likely the wolf, who was cunning and clever, may have understood what she said, but he thought it best to give no sign, and suffered the skin to be sewn upon him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='594'>"I can always get away if I choose," thought he, "it is better not to be in a hurry;" so he remained quite still while the skin was drawn over his head, which made him very hot and uncomfortable, and resisted the temptation to snap off the fingers or noses that were so close to his mouth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='595'>The fair was at its height next day when Toueno-Boueno arrived with his wolf in ram"s clothing. All the farmers crowded round him, each offering a higher price than the last. Never had they beheld such a beautiful beast, said they, and at last, after much bargaining, he was handed over to three brothers for a good sum of money.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='596'>It happened that these three brothers owned large flocks of sheep, though none so large and fine as the one they had just bought.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='597'>"My flock is the nearest," observed the eldest brother; "we will leave him in the fold for the night, and to-morrow we will decide which pastures will be best for him." And the wolf grinned as he listened, and held up his head a little higher than before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='598'>Early next morning the young farmer began to go his rounds, and the sheep-fold was the first place he visited. To his horror, the sheep were all stretched out dead before him, except one, which the wolf had eaten, bones and all. Instantly the truth flashed upon him. It was no ram that lay curled up in the corner pretending to be asleep (for in reality he could bend back and turn his head as much as he liked), but a wolf who was watching him out of the corner of his eye, and might spring upon him at any moment. So the farmer took no notice, and only thought that here was a fine chance of revenging himself on his next brother for a trick which he had played, and merely told him that the ram would not eat the grass in that field, and it might be well to drive him to the pasture by the river, where his own flock was feeding. The second brother eagerly swallowed the bait, and that evening the wolf was driven down to the field where the young man kept the sheep which had been left him by his father. By the next morning they also were all dead, but the second brother likewise held his peace, and allowed the sheep which belonged to the youngest to share the fate of the other two. Then they met and confessed to each other their disasters, and resolved to take the animal as fast as possible back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thrashing;disaster;animal;back' adjectives='sound;other;possible;fast' verbs='meet;confess;resolve;take;get' valence='5.43583333333' arousal='4.06583333333' dominance='5.43583333333'>Toueno-Boueno</entity>, who should get a sound thrashing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='599'>Antoine was sitting on a plum tree belonging to a neighbour, eating the ripe fruit, when he saw the three young farmers coming towards him. Swinging himself down, he flew home to the hut, crying breathlessly, "Mother, mother, the farmers are close by with the wolf. They have found out all about it, and will certainly kill me, and perhaps you too. But if you do as I tell you, I may be able to save us both.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='604'>"Well, it is the only chance. This whistle has been known to bring the dead back to life, and I hoped--" here he buried his face in his hands again, but peeping between his fingers he saw that the brother had opened their six eyes as wide as saucers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='605'>"Look!" he suddenly exclaimed with a cry, "Look! I am sure I felt her body move! And now her nostrils are twitching.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='606'>The farmers were so astonished at her restoration, that it was some time before they could speak. At length the eldest turned to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='length;eldest' adjectives='' verbs='turn;say' valence='5.6025' arousal='3.8575' dominance='5.9825'>the boy</entity> and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='607'>"Now listen to me. There is no manner of doubt that you are a young villain.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='608'>"It is my only treasure, and I set great store by it," answered the boy, pretending to hesitate. "But as you wish for it so much, well, I suppose I can"t refuse," and he held out the whistle, which the eldest brother put in his pocket.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='609'>Armed with the precious whistle, the three brothers returned home full of joy, and as they went the youngest said to the others, "I have such a good idea! Our wives are all lazy and grumbling, and make our lives a burden. Let us give them a lesson, and kill them as soon as we get in. Of course we can restore them to life at once, but they will have had a rare fright."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='610'>"Ah, how clever you are," answered the other two. "Nobody else would have thought of that."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='611'>So gaily the three husbands knocked down their three wives, who fell dead to the ground. Then one by one the men tried the whistle, and blew so loudly that it seemed as if their lungs would burst, but the women lay stark and stiff and never moved an eyelid. The husbands grew pale and cold, for they had never dreamed of this, nor meant any harm, and after a while they understood that their efforts were of no use, and that once more the boy had tricked them.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='612'>This time there was no escape. Toueno had been asleep, and only opened his eyes as they entered.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='631'>There was once a king in Ireland, and he had three daughters, and very nice princesses they were. And one day, when they and their father were walking on the lawn, the king began to joke with them, and to ask them whom they would like to be married to. "I"ll have the king of Ulster for a husband," says one; "and I"ll have the king of Munster," says another; "and," says the youngest, "I"ll have no husband but the Brown Bear of Norway." For a nurse of hers used to be telling her of an enchanted prince that she called by that name, and she fell in love with him, and his name was the first name on her tongue, for the very night before she was dreaming of him. Well, one laughed, and another laughed, and they joked with the princess all the rest of the evening. But that very night she woke up out of her sleep in a great hall that was lighted up with a thousand lamps; the richest carpets were on the floor, and the walls were covered with cloth of gold and silver, and the place was full of grand company, and the very beautiful prince she saw in her dreams was there, and it wasn"t a moment till he was on one knee before her, and telling her how much he loved her, and asking her wouldn"t she be his queen. Well, she hadn"t the heart to refuse him, and married they were the same evening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='632'>"Now, my darling," says he, when they were left by themselves, "you must know that I am under enchantment.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='633'>Well, when the princess woke in the morning, she missed her husband from her side, and spent the day very sadly. But as soon as the lamps were lighted in the grand hall, where she was sitting on a sofa covered with silk, the folding doors flew open, and he was sitting by her side the next minute. So they spent another happy evening, but he warned her that whenever she began to tire of him, or ceased to have faith in him, they would be parted for ever, and he"d be obliged to marry <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='faith;s;daughter;d;tire' adjectives='happy' verbs='be;begin;oblige;marry;warn;part;cease;have;spend' valence='5.72631578947' arousal='4.12473684211' dominance='5.47315789474'>the witch</entity>"s daughter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='634'>She got used to find him absent by day, and they spent a happy twelvemonth together, and at last a beautiful little boy was born; and happy as she was before, she was twice as happy now, for she had her child to keep her company in the day when she couldn"t see her husband.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='635'>At last, one evening, when herself, and himself, and her child were sitting with a window open because it was a sultry night, in flew an eagle, took the infant"s sash in his beak, and flew up in the air with him. She screamed, and was going to throw herself out the window after him, but the prince caught her, and looked at her very seriously. She bethought of what he said soon after their marriage, and she stopped the cries and complaints that were on her tongue. She spent her days very lonely for another twelvemonth, when a beautiful little girl was sent to her. Then she thought to herself she"d have a sharp eye about her this time; so she never would allow a window to be more than a few inches open.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='636'>But all her care was in vain. Another evening, when they were all so happy, and the prince dandling the baby, a beautiful greyhound stood before them, took the child out of the father"s hand, and was out of the door before you could wink. This time she shouted and ran out of the room, but there were some of the servants in the next room, and all declared that neither child nor dog passed out. She felt, somehow, as if it was her husband"s fault, but still she kept command over herself, and didn"t once reproach him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='637'>When the third child was born she would hardly allow a window or a door to be left open for a moment; but she wasn"t the nearer to keep the child to herself. They were sitting one evening by the fire, when a lady appeared standing by them. The princess opened her eyes in a great fright and stared at her, and while she was doing so, the lady wrapped a shawl round the baby that was sitting in its father"s lap, and either sank through the ground with it or went up through the wide chimney. This time the mother kept her bed for a month.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='638'>"My dear," said she to her husband, when she was beginning to recover, "I think I"d feel better if I was to see my father and mother and sisters once more. If you give me leave to go home for a few days I"d be glad." "Very well," said he, "I will do that, and whenever you feel inclined to return, only mention your wish when you lie down at night." The next morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber in her father"s palace. She rang the bell, and in a short time she had her mother and father and married sisters about her, and they laughed till they cried for joy at finding her safe back again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='639'>In time she told them all that had happened to her, and they didn"t know what to advise her to do. She was as fond of her husband as ever, and said she was sure that he couldn"t help letting the children go; but still she was afraid beyond the world to have another child torn from her. Well, the mother and sisters consulted a wise woman that used to bring eggs to the castle, for they had great faith in her wisdom. She said the only plan was to secure the bear"s skin that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;help;enchantment;bear;s;t;skin;man;plan' adjectives='only' verbs='be;secure;get;oblige;burn;say;put;couldn' valence='5.76' arousal='4.15461538462' dominance='5.41538461538'>the prince</entity> was obliged to put on every morning, and get it burned, and then he couldn"t help being a man night and day, and the enchantment would be at an end.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='640'>So they all persuaded her to do that, and she promised she would; and after eight days she felt so great a longing to see her husband again that she made the wish the same night, and when she woke three hours after, she was in her husband"s palace, and he himself was watching over her. There was great joy on both sides, and they were happy for many days.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='641'>Now she began to think how she never minded her husband leaving her in the morning, and how she never found him neglecting to give her a sweet drink out of a gold cup just as she was going to bed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='642'>One night she contrived not to drink any of it, though she pretended to do so; and she was wakeful enough in the morning, and saw her husband passing out through a panel in the wainscot, though she kept her eyelids nearly closed. The next night she got a few drops of the sleepy posset that she saved the evening before put into her husband"s night drink, and that made him sleep sound enough. She got up after midnight, passed through the panel, and found a Beautiful brown bear"s hide hanging in the corner. Then she stole back, and went down to the parlour fire, and put the hide into the middle of it till it was all fine ashes. She then lay down by her husband, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and fell asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='643'>If she was to live a hundred years she"d never forget how she wakened next morning, and found her husband looking down on her with misery and anger in his face. "Unhappy woman," said he, "you have separated us for ever! Why hadn"t you patience for five years? I am now obliged, whether I like or no, to go a three days" journey to the witch"s castle, and marry her daughter. The skin that was my guard you have burned it, and the egg-wife that gave you the counsel was the witch herself. I won"t reproach you: your punishment will be severe without it. Farewell for ever!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='644'>He kissed her for the last time, and was off the next minute, walking as fast as he could. She shouted after him, and then seeing there was no use, she dressed herself and pursued him. He never stopped, nor stayed, nor looked back, and still she kept him in sight; and when he was on the hill she was in the hollow, and when he was in the hollow she was on the hill. Her life was almost leaving her, when, just as the sun was setting, he turned up a lane, and went into a little house. She crawled up after him, and when she got inside there was a beautiful little boy on his knees, and he kissing and hugging him. "Here, my poor darling," says he, "is your eldest child, and there," says he, pointing to a woman that was looking on with a smile on her face, "is the eagle that carried him away." She forgot all her sorrows in a moment, hugging her child, and laughing and crying over him. The woman washed their feet, and rubbed them with an ointment that took all the soreness out of their bones, and made them as fresh as a daisy. Next morning, just before sunrise, he was up, and prepared to be off, "Here," said he to her, "is a thing which may be of use to you. It"s a scissors, and whatever stuff you cut with it will be turned into silk. The moment the sun rises, I"ll lose all memory of yourself and the children, but I"ll get it at sunset again. Farewell!" But he wasn"t far gone till she was in sight of him again, leaving her boy behind. It was the same to-day as yesterday: their shadows went before them in the morning and followed them in the evening. He never stopped, and she never stopped, and as the sun was setting he turned up another lane, and there they found their little daughter. It was all joy and comfort again till morning, and then the third day"s journey commenced.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='645'>But before he started he gave her a comb, and told her that whenever she used it, pearls and diamonds would fall from her hair. Still he had his memory from sunset to sunrise; but from sunrise to sunset he travelled on under the charm, and never threw his eye behind. This night they came to where the youngest baby was, and the next morning, just before sunrise, the prince spoke to her for the last time. "Here, my poor wife," said he, "is a little hand-reel, with gold thread that has no end, and the half of our marriage ring. If you ever get to my house, and put your half-ring to mine, I shall recollect you. There is a wood yonder, and the moment I enter it I shall forget everything that ever happened between us, just as if I was born yesterday. Farewell, dear wife and child, for ever!" Just then the sun rose, and away he walked towards the wood. She saw it open before him and close after him, and when she came up, she could no more get in than she could break through a stone wall. She wrung her hands and shed tears, but then she recollected herself, and cried out, "Wood, I charge you by my three magic gifts, the scissors, the comb, and the reel--to let me through"; and it opened, and she went along a walk till she came in sight of a palace, and a lawn, and a woodman"s cottage on the edge of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lawn;palace;gift;tear;edge;woodman;hand;walk;s;wood;sight;cottage;scissors;comb;reel' adjectives='nearest;magic' verbs='come;shed;open;cry;recollect;charge;let;go;wring' valence='5.52382352941' arousal='4.11941176471' dominance='5.52970588235'>the wood</entity> where it came nearest <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lawn;palace;gift;tear;edge;woodman;hand;walk;s;wood;sight;cottage;scissors;comb;reel' adjectives='nearest;magic' verbs='come;shed;open;cry;recollect;charge;let;go;wring' valence='5.52382352941' arousal='4.11941176471' dominance='5.52970588235'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='647'>It wasn"t long till she heard how a young prince, that was just arrived, was living in the palace of the young mistress. He seldom stirred abroad, and every one that saw him remarked how silent and sorrowful he went about, like a person that was searching for some lost thing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='648'>The servants and conceited folk at the big house began to take notice of the beautiful young woman at the lodge, and to annoy her with their impudence. The head footman was the most troublesome, and at last she invited him to come and take tea with her. Oh, how rejoiced he was, and how he bragged of it in the servants" hall! Well, the evening came, and the footman walked into the lodge, and was shown to her sitting-room; for the lodge-keeper and his wife stood in great awe of her, and gave her two nice rooms for herself. Well, he sat down as stiff as a ramrod, and was talking in a grand style about the great doings at the castle, while she was getting the tea and toast ready. "Oh," says she to him, "would you put your hand out at the window and cut me off a sprig or two of honeysuckle?" He got up in great glee, and put out his hand and head; and said she, "By the virtue of my magic gifts, let a pair of horns spring out of your head, and sing to the lodge." Just as she wished, so it was. They sprung from the front of each ear, and met at the back. Oh, the poor wretch!

Well, some way or other the story came to the ears of the prince, and he strolled down that way. She had only the dress of a countrywoman on her as she sat sewing at the window, but that did not hide her beauty, and he was greatly puzzled after he had a good look, just as a body is puzzled to know whether something happened to him when he was young or if he only dreamed it. Well, the witch"s daughter heard about it too, and she came to see the strange girl; and what did she find her doing but cutting out the pattern of a gown from brown paper; and as she cut away, the paper became the richest silk she ever saw. The witch"s daughter looked on with greedy eyes, and, says she, "What would you be satisfied to take for that scissors?" "I"ll take nothing," says she, "but leave to spend one night outside the prince"s chamber." Well, the proud lady fired up, and was going to say something dreadful; but the scissors kept on cutting, and the silk growing richer and richer every inch.

Then he took the peas which were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo. Some of the shells got broken, some remained whole, and when all were ready Lasse had twelve boats. But they should not be boats, they should be large warships. He had three liners, three frigates, three brigs and three schooners.

There stood the tall birch tree with its drooping leaves; at the top sat the old crow, and at its foot crept the gardener"s black cat. Not far away was a house which Little Lasse had seen before; near the house there was a garden, and in the garden a pea bed with long pea shells. An old gardener with a green coat walked about and wondered if the cucumbers were ripe. Fylax was barking on the steps, and when he saw Little Lasse he wagged his tail. Old Stina was milking the cows in the farmyard, and there was a very familiar lady in a check woollen shawl on her way to the bleaching green to see if the clothes were bleached. There was, too, a well-known gentleman in a yellow summer coat, with a long pipe in his mouth; he was going to see if the reapers had cut the rye. A boy and a girl were running on the shore and calling out, "Little Lasse! Come home for bread-and-butter!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='702'>"Shall we land here?" asked the dream-boy, and he blinked his blue eyes roguishly.</paragraph>

Now a serai, you must know, is generally just a large square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade along the inside all round to accommodate both men and beasts, and with perhaps a few rooms in towers at the corners for those who are too rich or too proud to care about sleeping by their own camels and horses. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;lad;country;proud;bed;course;innkeeper;t;cattle;home;buffalo' adjectives='old;fast;rich' verbs='be;set;borrow;remind;live;have;wasn' valence='5.7976' arousal='4.1384' dominance='5.5972'>Moti</entity>, of course, was a country lad and had lived with cattle all his life, and he wasn"t rich and he wasn"t proud, so he just borrowed a bed from the innkeeper, set it down beside an old buffalo who reminded him of home, and in five minutes was fast asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='748'>In the middle of the night he woke, feeling that he had been disturbed, and putting his hand under his pillow found to his horror that his bag of money had been stolen. He jumped up quietly and began to prowl around to see whether anyone seemed to be awake, but, though he managed to arouse a few men and beasts by falling over them, he walked in the shadow of the archways round the whole serai without coming across a likely thief. He was just about to give it up when he overheard two men whispering, and one laughed softly, and peering behind a pillar, he saw two Afghan horsedealers counting out his bag of money! Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bed' adjectives='' verbs='go' valence='6.08' arousal='3.48333333333' dominance='5.76'>Moti</entity> went back to bed!</paragraph>

The king, however, did not share his pleasure at all, but called up a soldier to shoot the tiger, much to the relief of all the inmates of the serai except Moti.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='768'>A week or two after this incident the king sent for Moti, who on arrival found his master in despair. A neighbouring monarch, he explained, who had many more soldiers than he, had declared war against him, and he was at his wits" end, for he had neither money to buy him off nor soldiers enough to fight him--what was he to do?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='769'>"If that is all, don"t you trouble," said Moti. "Turn out your men, and I"ll go with them, and we"ll soon bring this robber to reason."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='773'>A very comical sight was Moti when he rode out to the war. The only weapon he carried was his staff, and to help him to keep his balance on horseback he had tied to each of his ankles a big stone that nearly touched the ground as he sat astride the little pony. The rest of the king"s cavalry were not very numerous, but they pranced along in armour on fine horses. Behind them came a great rabble of men on foot armed with all sorts of weapons, and last of all was the king with his attendants, very nervous and ill at ease. So the army started.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='774'>They had not very far to go, but Moti"s little pony, weighted with a heavy man and two big rocks, soon began to lag behind the cavalry, and would have lagged behind the infantry too, only they were not very anxious to be too early in the fight, and hung back so as to give Moti plenty of time. The young man jogged along more and more slowly for some time, until at last, getting impatient at the slowness of the pony, he gave him such a tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony completely lost his temper and bolted. First one stone became untied and rolled away in a cloud of dust to one side of the road, whilst Moti nearly rolled off too, but clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged mane, and, dropping his staff, held on for dear life. Then, fortunately the other rock broke away from his other leg and rolled thunderously down a neighbouring ravine. Meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely time to draw to one side when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cavalry;pony;side;threat;time' adjectives='bloodthirsty;advanced' verbs='dash;draw;come;yell;have' valence='5.22846153846' arousal='4.06923076923' dominance='5.40076923077'>Moti</entity> came dashing by, yelling bloodthirsty threats to his pony:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='775'>"You wait till I get hold of you! I"ll skin you alive! I"ll wring your neck! I"ll break every bone in your body!" The cavalry thought that this dreadful language was meant for the enemy, and were filled with admiration of his courage. Many of their horses too were quite upset by this whirlwind that galloped howling through their midst, and in a few minutes, after a little plunging and rearing and kicking, the whole troop were following on <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;plunging;rearing;s;troop;midst;heel' adjectives='many;little;whole;whirlwind' verbs='be;gallop;upset;howl;follow;kick' valence='5.22666666667' arousal='4.36333333333' dominance='5.02777777778'>Moti</entity>"s heels.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='776'>Far in advance, Moti continued his wild career.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='780'>"Oh, sire!" panted the messenger, "fly at once, there is no time to lose. Foremost of the enemy rides a mad giant at a furious gallop.

Others ride behind, and you will do well to retire before this whirlwind of destruction comes upon you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='781'>Just then out of a cloud of dust in the distance the king saw Moti approaching at a hard gallop, looking indeed like a giant compared with the little beast he rode, whirling his castor-oil plant, which in the distance might have been an oak tree, and the sound of his revilings and shoutings came down upon the breeze! Behind him the dust cloud moved to the sound of the thunder of hoofs, whilst here and there flashed the glitter of steel. The sight and the sound struck terror into the king, and, turning his horse, he fled at top speed, thinking that a regiment of yelling giants was upon him; and all his force followed him as fast as they might go. One fat officer alone could not keep up on foot with that mad rush, and as Moti came galloping up he flung himself on the ground in abject fear. This was too much for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;right;pony;rocket;top;sky;foe;s' adjectives='much;fat' verbs='fly;be;alight;excite;shy;go' valence='5.87294117647' arousal='4.45058823529' dominance='5.52764705882'>Moti</entity>"s excited pony, who shied so suddenly that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;right;pony;rocket;top;sky;foe;s' adjectives='much;fat' verbs='fly;be;alight;excite;shy;go' valence='5.87294117647' arousal='4.45058823529' dominance='5.52764705882'>Moti</entity> went flying over his head like a sky rocket, and alighted right on the top of his fat foe.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='784'>But the poor fat officer could do nothing but squat on his knees with his hands together, gasping. At last, when he got his breath, Moti sent him off to bring his king, and to tell him that if he was reasonable his life should be spared. Off the poor man went, and by the time the troops of Moti"s side had come up and arranged themselves to look as formidable as possible, he returned with his king. The latter was very humble and apologetic, and promised never to make war any more, to pay a large sum of money, and altogether do whatever his conqueror wished.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='789'>A young man was out walking one day in Erin, leading a stout cart-horse by the bridle. He was thinking of his mother and how poor they were since his father, who was a fisherman, had been drowned at sea, and wondering what he should do to earn a living for both of them. Suddenly a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a voice said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='790'>"Will you sell me your horse, son of the fisherman?" and looking up he beheld a man standing in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='standing;shoulder;dog;gun;hand;falcon;side;man' adjectives='' verbs='behold;look' valence='5.42285714286' arousal='4.57571428571' dominance='5.43928571429'>the road</entity> with a gun in his hand, a falcon on his shoulder, and a dog by his side.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='794'>That night he rose softly, and left the house carrying the gun with him. "I will not stay here to be beaten," thought he, and he walked and he walked and he walked, till it was day again, and he was hungry and looked about him to see if he could get anything to eat. Not very far off was a farm-house, so he went there, and knocked at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='breakfast;farm-house;wife' adjectives='' verbs='be;knock;share;beg;go;come' valence='5.83454545455' arousal='4.06636363636' dominance='5.54727272727'>the door</entity>, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='breakfast;farm-house;wife' adjectives='' verbs='be;knock;share;beg;go;come' valence='5.83454545455' arousal='4.06636363636' dominance='5.54727272727'>the farmer</entity> and his wife begged him to come in, and share their breakfast.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='795'>"Ah, you have a gun," said the farmer as the young man placed it in a corner. "That is well, for a deer comes every evening to eat my corn, and I cannot catch it. It is fortune that has sent you to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='796'>"I will gladly remain and shoot the deer for you," replied the youth, and that night he hid himself and watched till the deer came to the cornfield; then he lifted his gun to his shoulder and was just going to pull the trigger, when, behold! instead of a deer, a woman with long black hair was standing there. At this sight his gun almost dropped from his hand in surprise, but as he looked, there was the deer eating the corn again. And thrice this happened, till the deer ran away over the moor, and the young man after her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='797'>On they went, on and on and one, till they reached a cottage which was thatched with heather. With a bound the deer sprang on the roof, and lay down where none could see her, but as she did so she called out, "Go in, fisher"s son, and eat and drink while you may." So he entered and found food and wine on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='food;man;business;robber;wine' adjectives='wicked' verbs='be;belong;find;enter' valence='5.64166666667' arousal='4.18' dominance='5.52416666667'>the table</entity>, but no man, for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='food;man;business;robber;wine' adjectives='wicked' verbs='be;belong;find;enter' valence='5.64166666667' arousal='4.18' dominance='5.52416666667'>the house</entity> belonged to some robbers, who were still away at their wicked business.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='798'>After Ian, the fisher"s son, had eaten all he wanted, he hid himself behind a great cask, and very soon he heard a noise, as of men coming through the heather, and the small twigs snapping under their feet.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='807'>No sooner were their faces touched with the sun"s rays than they were up and off. Then the deer entered and dropped the healing wax on the dead man, and he was as well as ever. By this time he did not mind what befell him, so sure was he that the deer would take care of him, and in the evening that which had happened before happened again--the four robbers were put to death and the fisher"s son also, but because there was no food left for them to eat, they were nearly mad with rage, and began to quarrel. From quarrelling they went on to fighting, and fought so hard that by and bye they were all stretched dead on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bye' adjectives='dead' verbs='go;be;fight;stretch;quarrel' valence='4.32555555556' arousal='4.75666666667' dominance='5.02111111111'>the floor</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='808'>Then the deer entered, and the fisher"s son was restored to life, and bidding him follow her, she ran on to a little white cottage where dwelt an old woman and her son, who was thin and dark.</paragraph>

Nothing could waken him, not even the sound of sweetest music, nor the touch of a lady who bent over him. A sad look came on her face, as she saw it was no use, and at last she gave it up, and lifting his arm, wrote her name across the side--"the daughter of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='use;daughter;look;wave;side;face;arm;name' adjectives='last;sad' verbs='be;give;write;see;lift;come' valence='5.61611111111' arousal='4.03111111111' dominance='5.45277777778'>the king</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='use;daughter;look;wave;side;face;arm;name' adjectives='last;sad' verbs='be;give;write;see;lift;come' valence='5.61611111111' arousal='4.03111111111' dominance='5.45277777778'>the town</entity> under the waves."</paragraph>

A second time the air was filled with music, and the lady came in, stepping softly, but though she laid his head on her knee, and combed his hair with a golden comb, his eyes opened not.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='828'>"You are a stranger here, that is plain," said the weaver, "but come in, and I will give you food and drink." And the young man was glad, for he knew not where to go, and they sat and talked till it grew late.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='829'>"Stay with me, I pray, for I love company and am lonely," observed the weaver at last, and he pointed to a bed in a corner, where the fisher"s son threw himself, and slept till dawn.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='830'>"There is to be a horse-race in the town to-day," remarked the weaver, "and the winner is to have the king"s daughter to wife." The young man trembled with excitement at the news, and his voice shook as he answered:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='832'>"Oh, that is quite easy--anyone can go," replied the weaver.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='833'>"That is a pity," returned the young man politely, but in his heart he rejoiced, for he wished to be alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='834'>Leaving the house, he entered a grove of trees which stood behind, and took the box from his pocket. He raised the lid, and out flew the three little birds.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='835'>"Good master, what shall we do for thee?" asked they, and he answered, "Bring me the finest horse that ever was seen, and the grandest dress, and glass shoes."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='836'>"They are here, master," said the birds, and so they were, and never had the young man seen anything so splendid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='837'>Mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses were assembling for the great race, and took his place among them. Many good beasts were there which had won many races, but the horse of the fisher"s son left them all behind, and he was first at the winning post. The king"s daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize, for he went back to the wood, and got off his horse, and put on his old clothes, and bade the box place some gold in his pockets. After that he went back to the weaver"s house, and told him that the gold had been given him by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gold;house;s;race;weaver;kindness' adjectives='' verbs='be;give;win;have;go;tell' valence='6.186' arousal='4.28666666667' dominance='5.726'>the man</entity> who had won the race, and that the weaver might have it for his kindness to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='838'>Now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess, the king ordered another race to be run, and the fisher"s son rode into the field still more splendidly dressed than he was before, and easily distanced everybody else.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='839'>"If he will not come of his own free will, he must be brought," said the king, and the messengers who had seen the face of the victor were sent to seek him in every street of the town. This took many days, and when at last they found the young man in the weaver"s cottage, he was so dirty and ugly and had such a strange appearance, that they declared he could not be the winner they had been searching for, but a wicked robber who had murdered ever so many people, but had always managed to escape.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='840'>"Yes, it must be the robber," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gallows;presence;son;s;sight;fisher;crime;punishment;robber;subject' adjectives='' verbs='be;lead;hang;say;build;behold;suffer' valence='4.97857142857' arousal='4.33476190476' dominance='5.2080952381'>the king</entity>, when the fisher"s son was led into his presence; "build a gallows at once and hang him in the sight of all my subjects, that they may behold him suffer the punishment of his crimes."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='841'>So the gallows was built upon a high platform, and the fisher"s son mounted the steps up to it, and turned at the top to make the speech that was expected from every doomed man, innocent or guilt. As he spoke he happened to raise his arm, and the king"s daughter, who was there at her father"s side, saw the name which she had written under it. With a shriek she sprang from her seat, and the eyes of the spectators were turned towards her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='842'>"Stop! stop!" she cried, hardly knowing what she said. "If that man is hanged there is not a soul in the kingdom but shall die also." And running up to where the fisher"s son was standing, she took him by the hand, saying,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='843'>"Father, this is no robber or murderer, but the victor in the three races, and he loosed the spells that were laid upon me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='844'>Then, without waiting for a reply, she conducted him into the palace, and he bathed in a marble bath, and all the dirt that the fairies had put upon him disappeared like magic, and when he had dressed himself in the fine garments the princess had sent to him, he looked a match for any king"s daughter in Erin.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='850'>A Fish Story</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='851'>Perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes, and never lived anywhere except in the water, but if you went to Australia and talked to the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country, you would learn something quite different. They would tell you that long, long ago you would have met fishes on the land, wandering from place to place, and hunting all sorts of animals, and if you consider how fishes are made, you will understand how difficult this must have been and how clever they were to do it. Indeed, so clever were they that they might have been hunting still if a terrible thing had not happened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='852'>One day the whole fish tribe came back very tired from a hunting expedition, and looked about for a nice, cool spot in which to pitch their camp. It was very hot, and they thought that they could not find a more comfortable place than under the branches of a large tree which grew by the bank of a river. So they made their fire to cook some food, right on the edge of a steep bank, which had a deep pool of water lying beneath it at the bottom. While the food was cooking they all stretched themselves lazily out under the tree, and were just dropping off to sleep when a big black cloud which they had never noticed spread over the sun, and heavy drops of rain began to fall, so that the fire was almost put out, and that, you know, is a very serious thing in savage countries where they have no matches, for it is very hard to light it again. To make matters worse, an icy wind began to blow, and the poor fishes were chilled right through their bodies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='853'>"This will never do," said Thuggai, the oldest of the fish tribe. "We shall die of cold unless we can light <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='flame;stick;hope;son' adjectives='cold' verbs='be;tire;rub;die;bid;produce;light;kindle;spark' valence='5.61666666667' arousal='4.43095238095' dominance='5.50666666667'>the fire</entity> again," and he bade his sons rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame, but though they rubbed till they were tired, not a spark could they produce.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='854'>"Let me try," cried <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fish;rest;bream;luck' adjectives='better;bony;more' verbs='try;cry;let;have' valence='5.749' arousal='3.928' dominance='5.423'>Biernuga</entity>, the bony fish, but he had no better luck, and no more had <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fish;rest;bream;luck' adjectives='better;bony;more' verbs='try;cry;let;have' valence='5.749' arousal='3.928' dominance='5.423'>Kumbal</entity>, the bream, nor any of the rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='855'>"It is no use," exclaimed Thuggai, at last. "The wood is too wet. We must just sit and wait till the sun comes out again and dries it." Then a very little fish indeed, not more than four inches long and the youngest of the tribe, bowed himself before Thuggai, saying, "Ask my father, Guddhu the cod, to light the fire. He is skilled in magic more than most fishes." So Thuggai asked him, and Guddhu stripped some pieces of bark off a tree, and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes. Then he knelt by the side of the fire and blew at it for a long while, till slowly the feeble red glow became a little stronger and the edges of the bark showed signs of curling up. When the rest of the tribe saw this they pressed close, keeping their backs towards the piercing wind, but Guddhu told them they must go to the other side, as he wanted the wind to fan his fire. By and by the spark grew into a flame, and a merry crackling was heard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='856'>"More wood," cried <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wood;flame' adjectives='more' verbs='gather;run;roar;cry;leap;heap;sputter' valence='5.27111111111' arousal='4.61777777778' dominance='5.34888888889'>Guddhi</entity>, and they all ran and gathered wood and heaped it on the flames, which leaped and roared and sputtered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='857'>"We shall soon be warm now," said the people one to another. "Truly Guddhu is great"; and they crowded round again, closer and closer. Suddenly, with a shriek, a blast of wind swept down from the hills and blew the fire out towards them. They sprang back hurriedly, quite forgetting where they stood, and all fell down the bank, each tumbling over the other, till they rolled into the pool that lay below. Oh, how cold it was in that dark water on which the sun never shone! Then in an instant they felt warm again, for the fire, driven by the strong wind, had followed them right down to the bottom of the pool, where it burned as brightly as ever. And the fishes gathered round it as they had done on the top of the cliff, and found the flames as hot as before, and that fire never went out, like those upon land, but kept burning for ever. So now you know why, if you dive deep down below the cold surface of the water on a frosty day, you will find it comfortable and pleasant underneath, and be quite sorry that you cannot stay there.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='861'>Maurice Connor was the king, and that"s no small word, of all the pipers in Munster. He could play jig and reel without end, and Ollistrum"s March, and the Eagle"s Whistle, and the Hen"s Concert, and odd tunes of every sort and kind. But he knew one far more surprising than the rest, which had in it the power to set everything dead or alive dancing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='862'>In what way he learned it is beyond my knowledge for he was mighty cautious about telling how he came by so wonderful a tune. At the very first note of that tune the shoes began shaking upon the feet of all how heard it--old or young, it mattered not--just as if the shoes had the ague; then the feet began going, going, going from under them, and at last up and away with them, dancing like mad, whisking here, there, and everywhere, like a straw in a storm--there was no halting while the music lasted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='863'>Not a fair, nor a wedding, nor a feast in the seven parishes round, was counted worth the speaking of without "blind Maurice and his pipes." His mother, poor woman, used to lead him about from one place to another just like a dog.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='865'>Here is was that Maurice"s music had brought from all parts a great gathering of the young men and the young women; for "twas not every day the strand of Trafraska was stirred up by the voice of a bagpipe.

Every inch of it covered with all manner of fish jumping and plunging about to the music, and every moment more and more would tumble in and out of the water, charmed by the wonderful tune. Crabs of monstrous size spun round and round on one claw with the nimbleness of a dancing master, and twirled and tossed their other claws about like limbs that did not belong to them.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='957'>There was once a rich old man who had two sons, and as his wife was dead, the elder lived with him, and helped him to look after his property. For a long time all went well; the young man got up very early in the morning, and worked hard all day, and at the end of every week his father counted up the money they had made, and rubbed his hands with delight, as he saw how big the pile of gold in the strong iron chest was becoming. "It will soon be full now, and I shall have to buy a larger one," he said to himself, and so busy was he with the thought of his money, that he did not notice how bright his son"s face had grown, nor how he sometimes started when he was spoken to, as if his mind was far away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='958'>One day, however, the old man went to the city on business, which he had not done for three years at least. It was market day, and he met with many people he knew, and it was getting quite late when he turned into the inn yard, and bade an ostler saddle his horse, and bring it round directly. While he was waiting in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='daughter-in-law;remark;vineyard;weather;marriage;gossip;landlady' adjectives='few;new' verbs='be;like;have;ask;surprise;come;wait' valence='5.83555555556' arousal='4.06' dominance='5.26333333333'>the hall</entity>, the landlady came up for a gossip, and after a few remarks about the weather and the vineyards she asked him how he liked his new daughter-in-law, and whether he had been surprised at the marriage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='959'>The old man stared as he listened to her. "Daughter-in-law? Marriage?" said he. "I don"t know what you are talking about! I"ve got no daughter-in-law, and nobody has been married lately, that I ever heard of."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='960'>Now this was exactly what the landlady, who was very curious, wanted to find out; but she put on a look of great alarm, and exclaimed:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='961'>"Oh, dear! I hope I have not made mischief. I had no idea--or, of course, I would not have spoken--but"--and here she stopped and fumbled with her apron, as if she was greatly embarrassed.</paragraph>

No, it was over the river he rode, and across the hill and past the cottage of Miguel the vine-keeper, whose daughter, they say, is the prettiest girl in the whole country side, though she is too white for my taste," and then the landlady paused again, and glanced up at the farmer, to see how he was taking it. She did not learn much. He was looking straight before him, his teeth set. But as she ceased to talk, he said quietly, "Go on."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='964'>"There is not much more to tell," replied the landlady, for she suddenly remembered that she must prepare supper for the hungry men who always stopped at the inn on market days, before starting for home, "but one fine morning they both went to the little church on top of the hill, and were married.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='966'>"I know everything--you have deceived me.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='969'>The young man shrank back. He feared lest his father should fall down in a fit, his face was so red and his eyes seemed bursting from his head. But it was no use staying: perhaps next morning the old man might listen to reason, though in his heart the son felt that he would never take back his words. So he turned slowly away, and walked heavily along a path which ended in a cave on the side of his hill, and there he sat through the night, thinking of what had happened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='970'>Yes, he had been wrong, there was no doubt of that, and he did not quite know how it had come about. He had meant to have told his father all about it, and he was sure, quite sure, that if once the old man had seen his wife, he would have forgiven her poverty on account of her great beauty and goodness. But he had put it off from day to day, hoping always for a better opportunity, and now this was the end!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='971'>If the son had no sleep that night, no more had the father, and as soon as the sun rose, he sent a messenger into the great city with orders to bring back the younger brother.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='972'>Though very pleased at the thought of becoming such a rich man--for the brothers had never cared much for each other--the younger would rather have stayed where he was, for he soon got tired of the country, and longed for a town life. However, this he kept to himself, and made the best of things, working hard like his brother before him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='973'>In this way the years went on, but the crops were not so good as they had been, and the old man gave orders that some fine houses he was building in the city should be left unfinished, for it would take all the savings to complete them. As to the elder son, he would never even hear his name mentioned, and died at last without ever seeing his face, leaving to the younger, as he had promised, all his lands, as well as his money.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='974'>Meanwhile, the son whom he had disinherited had grown poorer and poorer. He and his wife were always looking out for something to do, and never spent a penny that they could help, but luck was against them, and at the time of his father"s death they had hardly bread to eat or clothes to cover them. If there had been only himself, he would have managed to get on somehow, but he could not bear to watch his children becoming weaker day by day, and swallowing his pride, at length he crossed the mountains to his old home where his brother was living.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='975'>It was the first time for long that the two men had come face to face, and they looked at each other in silence. Then tears rose in the eyes of the elder, but winking them hastily away, he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='976'>"Brother, it is not needful that I should tell you how poor I am; you can see that for yourself. I have not come to beg for money, but only to ask if you will give me those unfinished houses of yours in the city, and I will make them watertight, so that my wife and children can live in them, and that will save our rent. For as they are, they profit you nothing."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='977'>And the younger brother listened and pitied him, and gave him the houses that he asked for, and the elder went away happy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='978'>For some years things went on as they were, and then the rich brother began to feel lonely, and thought to himself that he was getting older, and it was time for him to be married. The wife he chose was very wealthy, but she was also very greedy, and however much she had, she always wanted more. She was, besides, one of those unfortunate people who invariably fancy that the possessions of other people must be better than their own. Many a time her poor husband regretted the day that he had first seen her, and often her meanness and shabby ways put him to shame. But he had not the courage to rule her, and she only got worse and worse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='979'>After she had been married a few months the bride wanted to go into the city and buy herself some new dresses. She had never been there before, and when she had finished her shopping, she thought she would pay a visit to her unknown sister-in-law, and rest for a bit. The house she was seeking was in a broad street, and ought to have been very magnificent, but the carved stone portico enclosed a mean little door of rough wood, while a row of beautiful pillars led to nothing. The dwelling on each side were in the same unfinished condition, and water trickled down the walls. Most people would have considered it a wretched place, and turned their backs on it as soon as they could, but this lady saw that by spending some money the houses could be made as splendid as they were originally intended to be, and she instantly resolved to get them for herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='980'>Full of this idea she walked up the marble staircase, and entered the little room where her sister-in-law sat, making clothes for her children. The bride seemed full of interest in the houses, and asked a great many questions about them, so that her new relations liked her much better than they expected, and hoped they might be good friends. However, as soon as she reached home, she went straight to her husband, and told him that he must get back those houses from his brother, as they would exactly suit her, and she could easily make them into a palace as fine as the king"s. But her husband only told her that she might buy houses in some other part of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='house;part;gift;husband;brother' adjectives='many;other' verbs='make;buy;live;tell;have' valence='6.08058823529' arousal='4.01352941176' dominance='5.77529411765'>the town</entity>, for she could not have those, as he had long since made a gift of them to his brother, who had lived there for many years past.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='981'>At this answer the wife grew very angry. She began to cry, and made such a noise that all the neighbours heard her and put their heads out of the windows, to see what was the matter. "It was absurd," she sobbed out, "quite unjust. Indeed, if you came to think of it, the gift was worth nothing, as when her husband made it he was a bachelor, and since then he had been married, and she had never given her consent to any such thing." And so she lamented all day and all night, till the poor man was nearly worried to death; and at last he did what she wished, and summoned his brother in a court of law to give up the houses which, he said, had only been lent to him. But when the evidence on both sides had been heard, the judge decided in favour of the poor man, which made the rich lady more furious than ever, and she determined not to rest until she had gained the day. If one judge would not give her the houses another should, and so time after time the case was tried over again, till at last it came before the highest judge of all, in the city of Evora. Her husband was heartily tired and ashamed of the whole affair, but his weakness in not putting a stop to it in the beginning had got him into this difficulty, and now he was forced to go on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='982'>On the same day the two brothers set out on their journey to the city, the rich one on horseback, with plenty of food in his knapsack, the poor one on foot with nothing but a piece of bread and four onions to eat on the way. <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='front;light;window;distance' adjectives='little;glad;hilly' verbs='go;be;see;fall' valence='5.812' arousal='3.94533333333' dominance='5.32666666667'>The road</entity> was hilly and neither could go very fast, and when night fell, they were both glad to see some lights in a window a little distance in front of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='983'>The lights turned out to have been placed there by a farmer, who had planned to have a particularly good supper as it was his wife"s birthday, and bade the rich man enter and sit down, while he himself took the horse to the stable.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='984'>Supper was soon served, and very glad the younger brother was to eat it, for his long ride had made him very hungry. The farmer"s wife, however, would touch nothing, and at last declared that the only supper she wanted was one of the onions the poor man was cooking at the fire. Of course he gave it to her, though he would gladly have eaten it himself, as three onions are not much at the end of a long day"s walk, and soon after they all went to sleep, the poor man making himself as comfortable as he could in his corner.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='990'>Now all that night it had rained heavily, and did not seem likely to stop, and in some places the road was so thick with mud that it was almost impossible to get across it. In one spot it was so very bad that a mule laden with baggage had got stuck in it, and tug as he might, his master was quite unable to pull him out. The muleteer in despair appealed to the two horseman, who were carefully skirting <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='distance;help;mule;horseman;beast;patience;despair;muleteer;spirit' adjectives='poor;little;sure' verbs='be;begin;have;pay;cry;keep;come;hope;heed;appeal;skirt;declare;talk' valence='5.63344827586' arousal='4.02275862069' dominance='5.43068965517'>the swamp</entity> at some distance off, but they paid no heed to his cries, and he began to talk cheerfully to his mule, hoping to keep up his spirits, declaring that if the poor beast would only have a little patience help was sure to come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='991'>And so it did, for very soon the poor brother reached the place, bespattered with mud from head to foot, but ready to do all he could to help with the mule and his master. First they set about finding some stout logs of wood to lay down on the marsh so that they could reach the mule, for by this time his frantic struggles had broken his bridle, and he was deeper in than ever. Stepping cautiously along the wood, the poor man contrived to lay hold of the animal"s tale, and with a desperate effort the mule managed to regain his footing on dry ground, but at the cost of leaving his tail in the poor man"s hand. When he saw this the muleteer"s anger knew no bounds, and forgetting that without the help given him he would have lost his mule altogether, he began to abuse the poor man, declaring that he had ruined his beast, and the law would make him pay for it. Then, jumping on the back of the mule, which was so glad to be out of the choking mud that he did not seem to mind the loss of his tail, the ungrateful wretch rode on, and that evening reached <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='loss;back;mule;mud;tail;wretch;man' adjectives='ungrateful;rich;glad' verbs='be;do;reach;ride;mind;choke;jump;have;seem;arrive' valence='5.4756' arousal='4.052' dominance='5.43'>the inn</entity> at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='loss;back;mule;mud;tail;wretch;man' adjectives='ungrateful;rich;glad' verbs='be;do;reach;ride;mind;choke;jump;have;seem;arrive' valence='5.4756' arousal='4.052' dominance='5.43'>Evora</entity>, where the rich man and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='loss;back;mule;mud;tail;wretch;man' adjectives='ungrateful;rich;glad' verbs='be;do;reach;ride;mind;choke;jump;have;seem;arrive' valence='5.4756' arousal='4.052' dominance='5.43'>the farmer</entity> had already arrived for the night.</paragraph>

At length he found what he sought, but as it was too late and too dark for him to make sure of success, he curled himself up under a doorway, and slept till morning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='994'>Although it was winter, the sun rose in a clear sky, and its rays felt almost warm when the poor man got up and shook himself. He intended it to be the day of his death, but in spite of that, and of the fact that he was leaving his wife and children behind him, he felt almost cheerful. He had struggled so long, and was so very, very tired; but he would not have minded that if he could have proved his innocence, and triumphed over his enemies. However, they had all been too clever for him, and he had no strength to fight any more.

But so it was; and as the steeple opposite was touched by the golden light, the poor man shut his eyes and sprang forward. The wall was high, and he flew rapidly through the air, but it was not the ground he touched, only the body of the sick man, who rolled over and died without a groan. As for the other, he was quite unhurt, and was slowly rising to his feet when his arms were suddenly seized and held.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1373'>"I will tell you who I am," said the old man; "I am the raspberry king, who reigns over all this kingdom of raspberry bushes, and I have lived here for more than a thousand years. But the great spirit who rules over the woods, and the sea, and the sky, did not want me to become proud of my royal power and my long life. Therefore he decreed that one day in every hundred years I should change into a little raspberry worm, and live in that weak and helpless form from sunrise to sunset. During that time my life is dependent on the little worm"s life, so that a bird can eat me, a child can pick me with the berries and trample under foot my thousand years of life. Now yesterday was just my transformation day, and I was taken with the raspberry and would have been trampled to death if you had not saved my life. Until sunset I lay helpless in the grass, and when I was swept away from your table I twisted one of my feet, and my mouth became crooked with terror; but when evening came and I could take my own form again, I looked for you to thank you and reward you. Then I found you both here in my kingdom, and tried to meet you both as well as I could without frightening you. Now I will send a bird from my wood to show you the way home. Good-bye, little children, thank you for your kind hearts; the raspberry king can show that he is not ungrateful." The children shook hands with the old man and thanked him, feeling very glad that they had saved the little raspberry worm. They were just going when the old man turned round, smiled mischievously with his crooked mouth, and said: "Greetings to Otto from me, and tell him when I meet him again I shall do him the honour of eating him up."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1374'>"Oh, please don"t do that," cried both the girls, very frightened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1375'>"Well, for your sake I will forgive him," said the old man, "I am not revengeful. Greetings to Otto and tell him that he may expect a gift from me, too. Good-bye."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1386'>Perhaps some of you may have read a book called "Kenneth; or the Rear-Guard of the Grand Army" of Napoleon. If so, you will remember how the two Scotch children found in Russia were taken care of by the French soldiers and prevented as far as possible from suffering from the horrors of the terrible Retreat. One of the soldiers, a Breton, often tried to make them forget how cold and hungry they were by telling them tales of his native country, Brittany, which is full of wonderful things. The best and warmest place round the camp fire was always given to the children, but even so the bitter frost would cause them to shiver. It was then that the Breton would begin: "Plouhinec is a small town near Hennebonne by the sea," and would continue until Kenneth or Effie would interrupt him with an eager question. Then he forgot how his mother had told him the tale, and was obliged to begin all over again, so the story lasted a long while, and by the time it was ended the children were ready to be rolled up in what ever coverings could be found, and go to sleep. It is this story that I am going to tell to you.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1387'>Plouhinec is a small town near Hennebonne by the sea. Around it stretches a desolate moor, where no corn can be grown, and the grass is so coarse that no beast grows fat on it. Here and there are scattered groves of fir trees, and small pebbles are so thick on the ground that you might almost take it for a beach. On the further side, the fairies, or korigans, as the people called them, had set up long long ago two rows of huge stones; indeed, so tall and heavy were they, that it seemed as if all the fairies in the world could not have placed them upright.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1388'>Not far off them this great stone avenue, and on the banks of the little river Intel, there lived a man named Marzinne and his sister Rozennik. They always had enough black bread to eat, and wooden shoes or sabots to wear, and a pig to fatten, so the neighbours thought them quite rich; and what was still better, they thought themselves rich also.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1389'>Rozennik was a pretty girl, who knew how to make the best of everything, and she could, if she wished, have chosen a husband from the young men of Plouhinec, but she cared for none of them except Bernez, whom she had played with all her life, and Bernez, though he worked hard, was so very very poor that Marzinne told him roughly he must look elsewhere for a wife. But whatever <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shoulder;head;song;snatch' adjectives='old' verbs='nod;turn;say;pass;smile;sing' valence='5.81833333333' arousal='4.08333333333' dominance='5.89'>Marzinne</entity> might say <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shoulder;head;song;snatch' adjectives='old' verbs='nod;turn;say;pass;smile;sing' valence='5.81833333333' arousal='4.08333333333' dominance='5.89'>Rozennik</entity> smiled and nodded to him as before, and would often turn her head as she passed, and sing snatches of old songs over her shoulder.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1390'>Christmas Eve had come, and all the men who worked under Marzinne or on the farms round about were gathered in the large kitchen to eat the soup flavoured with honey followed by rich puddings, to which they were always invited on this particular night. In the middle of the table was a large wooden bowl, with wooden spoons placed in a circle round it, so that each might dip in his turn. The benches were filled, and Marzinne was about to give the signal, when the door was suddenly thrown open, and an old man came in, wishing the guests a good appetite for their supper. There was a pause, and some of the faces looked a little frightened; for the new-comer was well known to them as a beggar, who was also said to be a wizard who cast spells over the cattle, and caused the corn to grow black, and old people to die, of what, nobody knew. Still, it was Christmas Eve, and besides it was as well not to offend him, so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='spoon;rest;seat' adjectives='wooden' verbs='offend;be;invite;give' valence='6.05' arousal='4.09266666667' dominance='5.66666666667'>the farmer</entity> invited him in, and gave him a seat at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='spoon;rest;seat' adjectives='wooden' verbs='offend;be;invite;give' valence='6.05' arousal='4.09266666667' dominance='5.66666666667'>the table</entity> and a wooden spoon like the rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1391'>There was not much talk after the beggar"s entrance, and everyone was glad when the meal came to an end, and the beggar asked if he might sleep in the stable, as he should die of cold if he were left outside. Rather unwillingly Marzinne gave him leave, and bade Bernez take the key and unlock the door. There was certainly plenty of room for a dozen beggars, for the only occupants of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='donkey;room;beggar;sack;pillow;reed;occupant;ox;warmth' adjectives='old;wizard;only;thin;plenty;bitter' verbs='be;lay' valence='5.44708333333' arousal='3.96166666667' dominance='5.31'>the stable</entity> were an old donkey and a thin ox; and as the night was bitter, the wizard lay down between them for warmth, with a sack of reeds for a pillow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1392'>He had walked far that day, and even wizards get tired sometimes, so in spite of the hard floor he was just dropping off to sleep, when midnight struck from the church tower of Plouhinec. At this sound the donkey raised her head and shook her ears, and turned towards the ox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1393'>"Well, my dear cousin," said she, "and how have you fared since last Christmas Eve, when we had a conversation together?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1394'>Instead of answering at once, the ox eyed the beggar with a long look of disgust.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1397'>"His wicked pranks do not make him rich, certainly," said the ox, "and he isn"t even clever enough to have found out what a piece of luck might befall him a week hence."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1398'>"What piece of luck?" asked the donkey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1399'>"Why, don"t you know," inquired the ox, "that once very hundred years the stones on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;treasure;t;ox' adjectives='' verbs='be;don;inquire;drink;heath;know;go;uncover' valence='5.98285714286' arousal='4.075' dominance='5.80071428571'>Plouhinec</entity> heath go down to drink at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;treasure;t;ox' adjectives='' verbs='be;don;inquire;drink;heath;know;go;uncover' valence='5.98285714286' arousal='4.075' dominance='5.80071428571'>the river</entity>, and that while they are away the treasures underneath them are uncovered?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1400'>"Ah, I remember now," replied the donkey, "but the stones return so quickly to their places, that you certainly would be crushed to death unless you have in your hands a bunch of crowsfoot and of five-leaved trefoil."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1401'>"Yes, but that is not enough," said the ox; "even supposing you get safely by, the treasure you have brought with you will crumble into dust if you do not give in exchange a baptised soul. It is needful that a Christian should die before you can enjoy the wealth of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wealth' adjectives='needful' verbs='enjoy;be;die' valence='5.71' arousal='4.785' dominance='5.67166666667'>Plouhinec</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1402'>The donkey was about to ask some further questions, when she suddenly found herself unable to speak: the time allowed them for conversation was over.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1403'>"Ah, my dear creatures," thought the beggar, who had of course heard everything, "you are going to make me richer than the richest men of Vannes or Lorient. But I have no time to lose; to-morrow I must begin to hunt for the precious plants."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1404'>He did not dare to seek too near Plouhinec, lest somebody who knew the story might guess what he was doing, so he went away further towards the south, where the air was softer and the plants are always green. From the instant it was light, till the last rays had faded out of the sky, he searched every inch of ground where the magic plants might grow; he scarcely gave himself a minute to eat and drink, but at length he found the crowsfoot in a little hollow! Well, that was certainly a great deal, but after all, the crowsfoot was of no use without the trefoil, and there was so little time left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1405'>He had almost give up hope, when on the very last day before it was necessary that he should start of Plouhinec, he came upon a little clump of trefoil, half hidden under a rock. Hardly able to breathe from excitement, he sat down and hunted eagerly through the plant which he had torn up. Leaf after leaf he threw aside in disgust, and he had nearly reached the end when he gave a cry of joy--the five-leaved trefoil was in his hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1406'>The beggar scrambled to his feet, and without a pause walked quickly down the road that led northwards. The moon was bright, and for some hours he kept steadily on, not knowing how many miles he had gone, nor even feeling tired. By and bye the sun rose, and the world began to stir, and stopping at a farmhouse door, he asked for a cup of milk and slice of bread and permission to rest for a while in the porch.

But he kept silence as to the fate that awaited the man who was without the crowsfoot and the trefoil, and Bernez thought that nothing but boldness and quickness were necessary. So he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1420'>"Old man, I am grateful, indeed, for the chance you have given me, and there will always be a pint of my blood at your service.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1484'>All day long, while he was herding the cows, he thought and thought how he was to call the colt, for he felt sure that once on its back he could overcome the other dangers.

Remembering what he had seen the wizard do, he patched up an old halter that was hanging in a corner of the stable, twisted a rope of hemp to catch the colt"s feet, and a net such as is used for snaring birds. Next he sewed roughly together some bits of cloth to serve as a pocket, and this he filled with glue and lark"s feathers, a string of beads, a whistle of elder wood, and a slice of bread rubbed over with bacon fat.

Drawing his whistle from his pocket, he blew it loudly, so as to drown the sweet sounds about him, and ate what was left of his bread and bacon to still the craving of the magic fruits.

Over mountains, through deserts, across rivers I went, till I reached a fair valley full of trees, with a path running by the side of a stream. I walked along that path all the day, and in the evening I came to a castle in front of which stood two youths clothed in yellow, each grasping an ivory bow, with arrows made of the bones of the whale, and winged with peacock"s feathers. By their sides hung golden daggers with hilts of the bones of the whale.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1666'>"Near these young men was a man richly dressed, who turned and went with me towards the castle, where all the dwellers were gathered in the hall. In one window I beheld four and twenty damsels, and the least fair of them was fairer than Guenevere at her fairest. Some took my horse, and others unbuckled my armour, and washed it, with my sword and spear, till it all shone like silver. Then I washed myself and put on a vest and doublet which they brought me, and I and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='vest;feast;goodlier;table;silver;doublet' adjectives='' verbs='bring;sit;wash;have;enter;put' valence='5.59157894737' arousal='4.39894736842' dominance='5.66052631579'>the man</entity> that entered with me sat down before a table of silver, and a goodlier feast I never had.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1667'>"All this time neither the man nor the damsels had spoken one word, but when our dinner was half over, and my hunger was stilled, the man began to ask who I was. Then I told him my name and my father"s name, and why I came there, for indeed I had grown weary of gaining the mastery over all men at home, and sought if perchance there was one who could gain the mastery over me. And at this <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='answer;smile' valence='6.47' arousal='4.32666666667' dominance='6.37'>the man</entity> smiled and answered:</paragraph>

But to-night thou must sleep in the this castle, and in the morning see that thou rise early and follow the road upwards through the valley, until thou reachest a wood. In the wood is a path branching to the right; go along this path until thou comest to a space of grass with a mound in the middle of it. On the top of the mound stands a black man, larger than any two white men; his eye is in the centre of his forehead and he has only one foot. He carries a club of iron, and two white men could hardly lift it. Around him graze a thousand beasts, all of different kinds, for he is the guardian of that wood, and it is he who will tell thee which way to go in order to find the adventure thou art in quest of."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1669'>"So spake the man, and long did that night seem to me, and before dawn I rose and put on my armour, and mounted my horse and rode on till I reached the grassy space of which he had told me. There was the black man on top of the mound, as he had said, and in truth he was mightier in all ways than I had thought him to be. As for the club, Kai, it would have been a burden for four of our warriors. He waited for me to speak, and I asked him what power he held over the beasts that thronged so close about him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1670'>""I will show thee, little man," he answered, and with his club he struck a stag on the head till he brayed loudly. And at his braying the animals came running, numerous as the stars in the sky, so that scarce was I able to stand among them. Serpents were there also, and dragons, and beasts of strange shapes, with horns in places where never saw I horns before. And the black man only looked at them and bade them go and feed. And they bowed themselves before him, as vassals before their lord.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1671'>""Now, little man, I have answered thy question and showed thee my power," said he. "Is there anything else thou wouldest know?" Then I inquired of him my way, but he grew angry, and, as I perceived, would fain have hindered me; but at the last, after I had told him who I was, his anger passed from him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1672'>""Take that path," said he, "that leads to the head of this grassy glade, and go up the wood till thou reachest the top. There thou wilt find an open space, and in the midst of it a tall tree. Under the tree is a fountain, and by the fountain a marble slab, and on the slab a bowl of silver, with a silver chain. Dip the bowl in the fountain, and throw the water on the slab, and thou wilt hear a might peal of thunder, till heaven and earth seem trembling with the noise. After the thunder will come hail, so fierce that scarcely canst thou endure it and live, for the hailstones are both large and thick. Then the sun will shine again, but every leaf of the tree will by lying on the ground. Next a flight of birds will come and alight on the tree, and never didst thou hear a strain so sweet as that which they will sing. And at the moment in which their song sounds sweetest thou wilt hear a murmuring and complaining coming towards thee along the valley, and thou wilt see a knight in black velvet bestriding a black horse, bearing a lance with a black pennon, and he will spur his steed so as to fight thee. If thou turnest to flee, he will overtake thee. And if thou abidest were thou art, he will unhorse thee. And if thou dost not find trouble in that adventure, thou needest not to seek it during the rest of thy life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1673'>"So I bade the black man farewell, and took my way to the top of the wood, and there I found everything just as I had been told. I went up to the tree beneath which stood the fountain, and filling the silver bowl with water, emptied it on the marble slab. Thereupon the thunder came, louder by far than I had expected to hear it, and after the thunder came the shower, but heavier by far than I had expected to feel it, for, of a truth I tell thee, Kai, not one of those hailstones would be stopped by skin or by flesh till it had reached the bone. I turned my horse"s flank towards the shower, and, bending over his neck, held my shield so that it might cover his head and my own. When the hail had passed, I looked on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='leaf;song;sun;sky;hail;branch;ear;bird' adjectives='blue;single' verbs='shine;be;look;perch;leave;have;pass;sing;come' valence='6.06666666667' arousal='3.78333333333' dominance='5.61962962963'>the tree</entity> and not a single leaf was left on it, and the sky was blue and the sun shining, while on the branches were perched birds of very kind, who sang a song sweeter than any that has come to my ears, either before or since.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1674'>"Thus, Kai, I stood listening to the birds, when lo, a murmuring voice approached me, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1675'>""O knight, what has brought thee hither? What evil have I done to thee, that thou shouldest do so much to me, for in all my lands neither man nor beast that met that shower has escaped alive." Then from the valley appeared the knight on the black horse, grasping the lance with the black pennon. Straightway we charged each other, and though I fought my best, he soon overcame me, and I was thrown to the ground, while <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bridle;horse;straightway;armour;ground' adjectives='other;best' verbs='be;seize;ride;fight;leave;charge;despoil;throw;overcome' valence='5.24166666667' arousal='4.51888888889' dominance='5.35722222222'>the knight</entity> seized the bridle of my horse, and rode away with it, leaving me where I was, without even despoiling me of my armour.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1676'>"Sadly did I go down the hill again, and when I reached the glade where the black man was, I confess to thee, Kai, it was a marvel that I did not melt into a liquid pool, so great was my shame.

There was nothing that she did not seem to know, and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of Brittany, but could compose them herself. Was this really the quiet girl who had been so anxious to learn all he could teach her, or was it somebody else? Perhaps she had gone suddenly mad, and there was an evil spirit inside her. But in any case, night after night he came back, only to find her growing wiser and wiser. Soon the neighbours whispered their surprise among themselves, for Tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who despised her for her poor clothes, and many were the jokes she made about them.

Ah, this time she was not afraid of Aziliez or of any other girl, for surely none could be as fair and white as she. And with the sight of her face a thought came to her, and putting on hastily her best dress and her buckled shoes she hurried off to the dance.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1828'>At the end of an hour they arrived at a splendid castle, and Tephany, who would not move, was lifted out and carried into the hall, while a priest was sent for to perform the marriage ceremony. The young man tried to win a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as his wife, but Tephany did not listen to him, and looked about to see if there was any means by which she could escape. It did not seem easy. The three great doors were closely barred, and the one through which she had entered shut with a spring, but her feather was still in her hair, and by its aid she detected a crack in the wooden panelling, through which a streak of light could be dimly seen. Touching the copper pin which fastened her dress, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='copper;door;pin;whither;cabbage;dress' adjectives='little' verbs='count;be;send;go;know;pass;touch;fasten' valence='5.98647058824' arousal='3.75941176471' dominance='5.69'>the girl</entity> sent every one in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='copper;door;pin;whither;cabbage;dress' adjectives='little' verbs='count;be;send;go;know;pass;touch;fasten' valence='5.98647058824' arousal='3.75941176471' dominance='5.69'>the hall</entity> to count the cabbages, while she herself passed through the little door, not knowing whither she was going.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1829'>By this time night had fallen, and Tephany was very tired. Thankfully she found herself at the gate of a convent, and asked if she might stay there till morning.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1830'>In front of the house was a group of people; two or three women and the sons of the farmer. When their mother heard Tephany"s request to be given a bed the good wife"s heart softened, and she was just going to invite her inside, when the young men, whose heads were turned by the girl"s beauty, began to quarrel as to which should do most for her. From words they came to blows, and the women, frightened at the disturbance, pelted Tephany with insulting names. She quickly ran down the nearest path, hoping to escape them in the darkness of the trees, but in an instant she heard their footsteps behind her. Wild with fear her legs trembled under her, when suddenly she bethought herself of her necklace. With a violent effort she burst the clasp and flung it round the neck of a pig which was grunting in a ditch, and as she did so she heard the footsteps cease from pursuing her and run after the pig, for her charm had vanished.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1834'>"How could I have been so foolish," she whispered to herself, when she went down as usual at sunset. "It was not freedom to see Denis that I should have asked for, for he was soon weary of me, nor a quick tongue, for he was afraid of it, nor beauty, for that brought me nothing but trouble, but riches which make life easy both for oneself and others.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1836'>Tephany did not in the least understand what she meant, but ran back to the farm as fast as she could, and began to fumble joyfully in her right-hand pocket. Sure enough, there was the little box with the precious ointment. She was in the act of rubbing her eyes with it when Barbaik Bourhis entered the room. Ever since she had been obliged to leave her work and pass her time, she did not know why, in counting cabbages, everything had gone wrong, and she could not get a labourer to stay with her because of her bad temper.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2166'>Next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible, and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2167'>"Of course, Jegu must have done this in the hope of my giving him a dance," she thought to herself, and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help.

Morning and evening Barbaik found her earthen pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented with leaves. At the end of a few weeks she grew so used to this state of affairs that she only got up just in time to prepare breakfast.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2169'>Soon even this grew to be unnecessary, for a day arrived when, coming downstairs, she discovered that the house was swept, the furniture polished, the fire lit, and the food ready, so that she had nothing to do except to ring the great bell which summoned the labourers from the fields to come and eat it.

And she believed that all this was owing to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thought' adjectives='' verbs='owe;be;believe;do' valence='5.792' arousal='3.852' dominance='5.546'>Jegu</entity>, and she could no longer do without him, even in her thoughts.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='2173'>When things had reached this pass, the brownie told the young man that he had better ask Barbaik to marry him, and this time the girl did not turn rudely away, but listened patiently to the end. In her eyes he was as ugly and awkward as ever, but he would certainly make a most useful husband, and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time, just like a young lady, and as for the rest of the day, it would not be half long enough for all she meant to do. She would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them, and visit her neighbours, who would be dying of envy all the while, and she would be able to dance as much as she wished. Jegu would always be there to work for her and save for her, and watch over her.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2174'>The marriage took place the following month, and a few days later the old man died quite suddenly. Now Jegu had everything to see to himself, and somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive. But once more the brownie stepped in, and was better than ten labourers. It was he who ploughed and sowed and reaped, and if, as happened, occasionally, it was needful to get the work done quickly, the brownie called in some of his friends, and as soon as it was light a host of little dwarfs might have been seen in the fields, busy with hoe, fork or sickle. But by the time the people were about all was finished, and the little fellows had disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2175'>And all the payment the brownie ever asked for was a bowl of broth. From the very day of her marriage Barbaik had noted with surprise and rage that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the weeks and months before. She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he only stared at her, not understanding what she was talking about. But the brownie, who was standing by, burst out laughing, and confessed that all the good offices she spoke of had been performed by him, for the sake of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='office;business;sake;house;brownie;laughing;time' adjectives='high;good;other' verbs='be;look;do;burst;perform;confess;stand;have;speak' valence='5.836' arousal='3.776' dominance='5.6185'>Jegu</entity>, but that now he had other business to do, and it was high time that she looked after her house herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2176'>Barbaik was furious. Each morning when she was obliged to get up before dawn to milk the cows and go to market, and each evening when she had to sit up till midnight in order to churn the butter, her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure. But when she looked at <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hair;anger;eye;face' adjectives='red;untidy' verbs='be;behold;look;squint;double' valence='5.42272727273' arousal='4.02363636364' dominance='5.54363636364'>Jegu</entity> and beheld his red face, squinting eyes, and untidy hair, her anger was doubled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2177'>"If it had not been for you, you miserable dwarf!" she would say between her teeth, "if it had not been for you I should never have married that man, and I should still have been going to dances, where the young men would have brought me present of nuts and cherries, and told me that I was the prettiest girl in the parish. While now I can receive no presents except from my husband. I can never dance, except with my husband. Oh, you wretched dwarf, I will never, never forgive you!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2178'>In spite of her fierce words, no one knew better than Barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her, and after receiving an invitation to a wedding, she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there. To her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted. Full of excitement, Barbaik started on her journey. It was not long, and when she reached the town she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding counsel in a wide green place, and said to them, "Listen, my friends! I have come to beg you to lend me a black horse, with eyes, a mouth, ears, bridle and saddle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2179'>She had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back she started for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;wedding' adjectives='back' verbs='be;appear;mount;start;have;hold;speak' valence='5.94416666667' arousal='3.92' dominance='5.53166666667'>the village</entity> where the wedding was to be held.</paragraph>

At length she caught some words uttered by one man to another. "Why, the farmer"s wife has sold her horse"s tail!" and turned in her saddle. Yes; it was true. Her horse had no tail! She had forgotten to ask for one, and the wicked dwarfs had carried out her orders to the letter!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2181'>"Well, at any rate, I shall soon be there," she thought, and shaking the reins, tried to urge the horse to a gallop. But it was of no use; he declined to move out of a walk; and she was forced to hear all the jokes that were made upon her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2183'>It was the spring, and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their fete, so one day the brownie asked Jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn, and whether he would allow them to dance there. Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best table-cloths in the barn, and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes, and, besides, to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning. He expected she would refuse, as he knew she hated the dwarfs, but she said nothing, and prepared the supper as he had bidden her.</paragraph>

But hard was the boar to catch, and fiercely did he fight when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boar;battle;s;man' adjectives='many;hard' verbs='be;do;slay;give;fight;catch' valence='5.05' arousal='4.46' dominance='5.36'>Arthur</entity>"s men gave him battle, so that many of them were slain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2322'>Up and down the country went Trwyth the boar, and Arthur followed after him, till they came to the Severn sea. There three knights caught his feet unawares and plunged him into the water, while one snatched the razor from him, and another seized the scissors. But before they laid hold of the comb he had shaken them all off, and neither man nor horse nor dog could reach him till he came to Cornwall, whither Arthur had sworn he should not go. Thither Arthur followed after him with his knights, and if it had been hard to win the razor and the scissors, the struggle for the comb was fiercer still, but at length Arthur prevailed, and the boar was driven into the sea. And whether he was drowned or where he went no man knows to this day.</paragraph>

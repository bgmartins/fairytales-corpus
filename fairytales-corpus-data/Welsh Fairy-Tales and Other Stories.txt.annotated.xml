	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='69'>Once upon a time a lot of fairies lived in <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time;lot;fairy' adjectives='' verbs='live'>Mona</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>u"One day the queen fairy"s daughter, who was now fifteen years of age, told her mother she wished to go out and see the world."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>The queen consented, allowing her to go for a day, and to change from a fairy to a bird, or from a bird to a fairy, as she wished.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='72'>When she returned one night she said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>"I\"ve been to a gentleman\"s house, and as I stood listening, I heard the gentleman was witched: he was very ill, and crying out with pain."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>"Oh, I must look into that," said the queen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='75'>u"So the next day she went through her process and found that he was bewitched by an old witch. So the following day she set out with six other fairies, and when they came to the gentleman"s house she found he was very ill."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>Going into the room, bearing a small blue pot they had brought with them, the queen asked him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>"Would you like to be cured?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='78'>"Oh, bless you; yes, indeed."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='79'>Whereupon the queen put the little blue pot of perfume on the centre of the table, and lit it, when the room was instantly filled with the most delicious odour.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>Whilst the perfume was burning, the six fairies formed in line behind her, and she leading, they walked round the table three times, chanting in chorus:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>"Round and round three times three,   We have come to cure thee."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>At the end of the third round she touched the burning perfume with her wand, and then touched the gentleman on the head, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>"Be thou made whole."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>No sooner had she said the words than he jumped up hale and hearty, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"Oh, dear queen, what shall I do for you? I\"ll do anything you wish."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>"Money I do not wish for," said the queen, "but there\"s a little plot of ground on the sea-cliff I want you to lend me, for I wish to make a ring there, and the grass will die when I make the ring. Then I want you to build three walls round the ring, but leave the sea-side open, so that we may be able to come and go easily."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>"With the greatest of pleasure," said the gentleman; and he built the three stone walls at once, at the spot indicated.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>II.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>Near the gentleman lived the old witch, and she had the power of turning at will into a hare. The gentleman was a great hare hunter, but the hounds could never catch this hare; it always disappeared in a mill, running between the wings and jumping in at an open window, though they stationed two men and a dog at the spot, when it immediately turned into the old witch. And the old miller never suspected, for the old woman used to take him a peck of corn to grind a few days before any hunt, telling him she would call for it on the afternoon of the day of the hunt. So that when she arrived she was expected.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>One day she had been taunting the gentleman as he returned from a hunt, that he could never catch the hare, and he struck her with his whip, saying "Get away, you witchcraft!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>Whereupon she witched him, and he fell ill, and was cured as we have seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>u"When he got well he watched the old witch, and saw she often visited the house of an old miser who lived near by with his beautiful niece. Now all the people in the village touched their hats most respectfully to this old miser, for they knew he had dealings with the witch, and they were as much afraid of him as of her; but everyone loved the miser"s kind and beautiful niece."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>III.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>When the fairies got home the queen told her daughter:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>"I have no power over the old witch for twelve months from to-day, and then I have no power over her life. She must lose that by the arm of a man."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>So the next day the daughter was sent out again to see whether she could find a person suited to that purpose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>In the village lived a small crofter, who was afraid of nothing; he was the boldest man thereabouts; and one day he passed the miser without saluting him. The old fellow went off at once and told the witch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>"Oh, I\"ll settle his cows to-night!" said she, and they were taken sick, and gave no milk that night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>u"The fairy"s daughter arrived at his croft-yard after the cows were taken ill, and she heard him say to his son, a bright lad:"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='102'>"It must be the old witch!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>When she heard this, she sent him to the queen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='104'>So next day the fairy queen took six fairies and went to the croft, taking her blue pot of perfume. When she got there she asked the crofter if he would like his cows cured?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>"God bless you, yes!" he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>The queen made him bring a round table into the yard, whereon she placed the blue pot of perfume, and having lit it, as before, they formed in line and walked round thrice, chanting the words:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='107'>"Round and round three times three,   We have come to cure thee."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>Then she dipped the end of her wand into the perfume, and touched the cows on the forehead, saying to each one:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>"Be thou whole."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='110'>Whereupon they jumped up cured.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>The little farmer was overjoyed, and cried:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='112'>"Oh, what can I do for you? What can I do for you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>"Money I care not for," said the queen, "all I want is your son to avenge you and me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>The lad jumped up and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='115'>"What I can do I\"ll do it for you, my lady fairy."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='116'>She told him to be at the walled plot the following day at noon, and left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='117'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='118'>IV.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='119'>The next day at noon, the queen and her daughter and three hundred other fairies came up the cliff to the green grass plot, and they carried a pole, and a tape, and a mirror. When they reached the plot they planted the pole in the ground, and hung the mirror on the pole. The queen took the tape, which measured ten yards and was fastened to the top of the pole, and walked round in a circle, and wherever she set her feet the grass withered and died. Then the fairies followed up behind the queen, and each fairy carried a harebell in her left-hand, and a little blue cup of burning perfume in her right. When they had formed up the queen called the lad to her side, and told him to walk by her throughout. They then started off, all singing in chorus:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='120'>"Round and round three times three,   Tell me what you see."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>When they finished the first round, the queen and lad stopped before the mirror, and she asked the lad what he saw?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='122'>"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,   It is the witch that I see,"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='123'>said the lad. So they marched round again, singing the same words as before, and when they stopped a second time before the mirror the queen again asked him what he saw?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='124'>"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,   It is a hare that I see,"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='125'>said the lad.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>A third time the ceremony and question were repeated.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='127'>"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,   The hares run up the hill to the mill."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='128'>"Now," said the queen, "there is to be a hare-hunting this day week; be at the mill at noon, and I will meet you there."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='129'>And then the fairies, pole, mirror, and all, vanished and only the empty ring on the green was left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='131'>V.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='132'>Upon the appointed day the lad went to his tryst, and at noon the Fairy Queen appeared, and gave him a sling, and a smooth pebble from the beach, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='133'>"I have blessed your arms, and I have blessed the sling and the stone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='134'>"Now as the clock strikes three,   Go up the hill near the mill,   And in the ring stand still   Till you hear the click of the mill.   Then with thy arm, with power and might,   You shall strike and smite   The devil of a witch called Jezabel light,   And you shall see an awful sight."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='135'>u"The lad did as he was bidden, and presently he heard the huntsman"s horn and the hue and cry, and saw the hare running down the opposite hill-side, where the hounds seemed to gain on her, but as she breasted the hill on which he stood she gained on them. As she came towards the mill he threw his stone, and it lodged in her skull, and when he ran up he found he had killed the old witch. As the huntsmen came up they crowded round him, and praised him; and then they fastened the witch"s body to a horse by ropes, and dragged her to the bottom of the valley, where they buried her in a ditch. That night, when the miser heard of her death, he dropped down dead on the spot."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='136'>As the lad was going home the queen appeared to him, and told him to be at the ring the following day at noon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='137'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='138'>VI.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='139'>Next day all the fairies came with the pole and mirror, each carrying a harebell in her left-hand, and a blue cup of burning perfume in her right, and they formed up as before, the lad walking beside the queen. They marched round and repeated the old words, when the queen stopped before the mirror, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='140'>"What do you see?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='141'>"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,   It is an old plate-cupboard that I see."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='142'>A second time they went round, and the question, was repeated.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='143'>"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,   The back is turned to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='144'>A third time was the ceremony fulfilled, and the lad answered</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='145'>"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,   A spring-door is open to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='146'>"Buy that plate-cupboard at the miser\"s sale," said the queen, and she and her companions disappeared as before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='147'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='148'>VII.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='149'>u"Upon the day of the sale all the things were brought out in the road, and the plate-cupboard was put up, the lad recognising it and bidding up for it till it was sold to him. When he had paid for it he took it home in a cart, and when he got in and examined it, he found the secret drawer behind was full of gold. The following week the house and land, thirty acres, was put up for sale, and the lad bought both, and married the miser"s niece, and they lived happily till they died."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='150'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='151'>THE CRAIG-Y-DON BLACKSMITH.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='152'>Once upon a time an old blacksmith lived in an old forge at Craig-y-don, and he used to drink a great deal too much beer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='153'>One night he was coming home from an alehouse very tipsy, and as he got near a small stream a lot of little men suddenly sprang up from the rocks, and one of them, who seemed to be older than the rest, came up to him, and said,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='154'>"If you don\"t alter your ways of living you\"ll die soon; but if you behave better and become a better man you\"ll find it will be to your benefit," and they all disappeared as quickly as they had come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='155'>The old blacksmith thought a good deal about what the fairies had told him, and he left off drinking, and became a sober, steady man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='156'>One day, a few months after meeting the little people, a strange man brought a horse to be shod. Nobody knew either the horse or the man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='157'>The old blacksmith tied the horse to a hole in the lip of a cauldron (used for the purpose of cooling his hot iron) that he had built in some masonry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='158'>When he had tied the horse up he went to shoe the off hind-leg, but directly he touched the horse the spirited animal started back with a bound, and dragged the cauldron from the masonry, and then it broke the halter and ran away out of the forge, and was never seen again: neither the horse nor its master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='159'>When the old blacksmith came to pull down the masonry to rebuild it, he found three brass kettles full of money.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='160'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='161'>OLD GWILYM.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='162'>Old Gwilym Evans started off one fine morning to walk across the Eagle Hills to a distant town, bent upon buying some cheese. On his way, in a lonely part of the hills, he found a golden guinea, which he quickly put into his pocket.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='163'>When he got to the town, instead of buying his provisions, he went into an alehouse, and sat drinking and singing with some sweet-voiced quarrymen until dark, when he thought it was time to go home. Whilst he was drinking, an old woman with a basket came in, and sat beside him, but she left before him. After the parting glass he got up and reeled through the town, quite forgetting to buy his cheese; and as he got amongst the hills they seemed to dance up and down before him, and he seemed to be walking on air. When he got near the lonely spot where he had found the money he heard some sweet music, and a number of fairies crossed his path and began dancing all round him, and then as he looked up he saw some brightly-lighted houses before him on the hill; and he scratched his head, for he never remembered having seen houses thereabouts before. And as he was thinking, and watching the fairies, one came and begged him to come into the house and sit down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='164'>So he followed her in, and found the house was all gold inside it, and brightly lighted, and the fairies were dancing and singing, and they brought him anything he wanted for supper, and then they put him to bed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='165'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='round;body;prickle;eye;bunch;gorse' adjectives='cold;naked' verbs='sleep;awake;turn;feel;seem;cover;sit;rub;find;be;lie'>Gwilym</entity> slept heavily, and when he awoke turned round, for he felt very cold, and his body seemed covered with prickles; so he sat up and rubbed his eyes, and found that he was quite naked and lying in a bunch of gorse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='166'>When he found himself in this plight he hurried home, and told his wife, and she was very angry with him for spending all the money and bringing no cheese home, and then he told her his adventures.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='167'>"Oh, you bad man!" she said, "the fairies gave you money and you spent it wrongly, so they were sure to take their revenge."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='168'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='169'>THE BABY-FARMER.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='170'>Old Kaddy was a baby-farmer, and one day she went to the woods to gather sticks for her fire, and whilst she was gathering the sticks she found a piece of gold, and took it home; but she never told anyone she had found the money, for she always pretended to be very poor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='171'>But though she was so poor, she used to dress two of her children in fine clothes; but the others, whom she did not like, she kept in the filthiest rags.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='172'>One day a man knocked at her door, and asked to see the children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='173'>u"He sat down in her little room, and she went and brought the ragged little boy and girl, saying she was very poor, and couldn"t afford to dress them better; for she had been careful to hide the well-dressed little boy and girl in a cockloft."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='174'>After the stranger had gone she went to the cockloft to look for her well-dressed favourites, but they had disappeared, and they were never seen afterwards, for they were turned into fairies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='175'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='176'>THE OLD MAN AND THE FAIRIES.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='177'>Many years ago the Welsh mountains were full of fairies. People used to go by moonlight to see them dancing, for they knew where they would dance by seeing green rings in the grass.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='178'>There was an old man living in those days who used to frequent the fairs that were held across the mountains. One day he was crossing the mountains to a fair, and when he got to a lonely valley he sat down, for he was tired, and he dropped off to sleep, and his bag fell down by his side. When he was sound asleep the fairies came and carried him off, bag and all, and took him under the earth, and when he awoke he found himself in a great palace of gold, full of fairies dancing and singing. And they took him and showed him everything, the splendid gold room and gardens, and they kept dancing round him until he fell asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='179'>When he was asleep they carried him back to the same spot where they had found him, and when he awoke he thought he had been dreaming, so he looked for his bag, and got hold of it, but he could hardly lift it. When he opened it he found it was nearly filled with gold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='180'>He managed to pick it up, and turning round, he went home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='181'>When he got home, his wife <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;wife;s;haven;t' adjectives='fair' verbs='get;say;do;be'>Kaddy</entity> said: "What\"s to do, why haven\"t you been to the fair?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='182'>"I\"ve got something here," he said, and showed his wife the gold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='183'>"Why, where did you get that?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='217'>u"Many years ago there lived several wild tribes round the King of Persia"s city, and the king"s men were always annoying and harassing them, exacting yearly a heavy tribute. Now these tribes, though very brave in warfare, could not hold their own before the Persian army when sent out against them, so that they paid their yearly tribute grudgingly, but took revenge, whenever they could, upon travellers to or from the city, robbing and killing them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='218'>At last one of the tribesmen, a clever old chieftain, thought of a cunning plan whereby to defeat the Persians, and free themselves from the yearly tribute. And this was his scheme:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='219'>The wild wastes where these tribes lived were infested with large birds called "Rohs", [Footnote: Pronounced softly.] which were very destructive to human beings--devouring men, women, and children greedily whenever they could catch them. Such a terror were they that the tribes had to protect their village with high walls, [Footnote: Can this have anything to do with the idea of walling-in the cuckoo?] and then they slept securely, for the Roh hunted by night. This old chieftain determined to watch the birds, and find out their nesting-places; so he had a series of towers built, in which the watchmen could sleep securely by night. These towers were advanced in whatever direction the birds were seen to congregate by night. The observers reported that the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='observer;horse' adjectives='fleeter' verbs='report;fly;run;be'>Roh</entity> could not fly, but ran very swiftly, being fleeter than any horse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='220'>At length, by watching, their nesting-places were found in a sandy plain, and it was discovered that those monstrous birds stole sheep and cattle in great numbers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='221'>The chieftain then gave orders for the watchmen to keep on guard until the young birds were hatched, when they were commanded to secure fifty, and bring them into the walled town. The order was carried out, and one night they secured fifty young birds just out of the egg, and brought them to the town.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='222'>The old chieftain then told off fifty skilful warriors, a man to each bird, to his son being allotted the largest bird. These warriors were ordered to feed the birds on flesh, and to train them for battle. The birds grew up as tame as horses. Saddles and bridles were made for them, and they were trained and exercised just like chargers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='223'>When the next tribute day came round, the King of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tribute;round;king;emissary;tax;chieftain;tribe;king;army' adjectives='next' verbs='come;send;collect;insult;defy;return;send'>Persia</entity> sent his emissaries to collect the tax, but the chieftains of the tribes insulted and defied them, so that they returned to the king, who at once sent forward his army.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='224'>The chieftain then marshalled his men, and forty-six of the Rohs were drawn up in front of the army, the chief getting on the strongest bird. The remaining four were placed on the right flank, and ordered at a signal to advance and cut off the army, should they retreat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='225'>The Rohs had small scales, like those of a fish, on their necks and bodies, the scales being hidden under a soft hair, except on the upper half of the neck. They had no feathers except on their wings. So they were invulnerable except as to the eyes--for in those days the Persians only had bows and arrows, and light javelins. When the Persian army advanced, the Rohs advanced at lightning speed, and made fearful havoc, the birds murdering and trampling the soldiers under foot, and beating them down with their powerful wings. In less than two hours half the Persian army was slain, and the rest had escaped. The tribes returned to their walled towns, delighted with their victory.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='226'>When the news of his defeat reached the King of Persia he was wroth beyond expression, and could not sleep for rage. So the next morning he called for his magician.</paragraph>

I don\"t believe I was asleep at all, I could see it so plainly. I went along in the air, looking at seven black crows all the time. I got dizzy, and the vessel seemed to lower on to the earth. The vessel lowered within a few hundred feet of the earth, and I saw what I thought were fairies. I thought I had been there for days; in truth, it seemed to me I had been up there for three days, and that I could hear the fairies with mournful sounds drawing a coffin. I watched and watched, and saw seven crows on the coffin. It seemed as if they were going to bury someone. Whilst the coffin was going the seven crows flew up and bursted, and the heavens were illuminated more strongly than by the sun. Then I lost sight of the fairies, but saw some big giants in white walking about, and there was a big throne with a roof to it. And all at once I was in total darkness, but I could hear things flapping about, flying through the air. Then I saw the moon rising and all the stars, and all sorts of objects flying through the air. And one came to me, and put his hand upon my shoulder, saying: _\"Prepare to meet us to-morrow.\"_ After that everything went dark again. The first thing I knew I was in a ship steering, and the seven black crows were in front of me. I had a great trouble to steer my vessel. And as I went on the vessel struck a steeple, and exploded, and I awoke. Whereupon I jumped out of bed, looking very pale."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='280'>In olden times fairies were sent to oppose the evil-doings of witches, and to destroy their power. About three hundred years ago a band of fairies, sixty in number, with their queen, called Queen of the Dell, came to Mona to oppose the evil works of a celebrated witch. The fairies settled by a spring, in a valley. After having blessed the spring, or "well", as they called it, they built a bower just above the spring for the queen, placing a throne therein. Near by they built a large bower for themselves to live in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='281'>After that, the queen drew three circles, one within the other, on a nice flat grassy place by the well. When they were comfortably settled, the queen sent the fairies about the country to gather tidings of the people. They went from house to house, and everywhere heard great complaints against an old witch; how she had made some blind, others lame, and deformed others by causing a horn to grow out of their foreheads. When they got back to the well and told the queen, she said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='282'>"I must do something for these old people, and though the witch is very powerful, we must break her power." So the next day the queen fairy sent word to all the bewitched to congregate upon a fixed day at the sacred well, just before noon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='283'>u"When the day came, several ailing people collected at the well. The queen then placed the patients in pairs in the inner ring, and the sixty fairies in pairs in the middle ring. Each little fairy was three feet and a half high, and carried a small wand in her right hand, and a bunch of fairy flowers--cuckoo"s boots, baby"s bells, and day"s-eyes--in her left hand. Then the queen, who was four feet and a half in height, took the outside ring. On her head was a crown of wild flowers, in her right hand she carried a wand, and in her left a posy of fairy flowers. At a signal from the queen they began marching round the rings, singing in chorus:"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='285'>When they had walked twice round the ring singing, the queen took her seat upon the throne, and calling each patient to her, she touched him with her wand and bade him go down to the sacred well and dip his body into the water three times, promising that all his ills should be cured. As each one came forth from the spring he knelt before the queen, and she blessed him, and told him to hurry home and put on dry clothes. So that all were cured of their ills.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='288'>u"Now the old witch who had worked all these evils lived near the well in a cottage. She had first learned witchcraft from a book called _The Black Art_, which a gentleman farmer had lent her when a girl. She progressed rapidly with her studies, and being eager to learn more, sold herself to the devil, who made compact with her that she should have full power for seven years, after which she was to become his. He gave her a wand that had the magic power of drawing people to her, and she had a ring on the grass by her house just like the fairy"s ring. As the seven years were drawing to a close, and her heart was savage against the farmer who first led her into the paths of evil knowledge, she determined to be revenged. One day, soon after the Fairy of the Dell came to live by the spring, she drew the farmer to her with her wand, and, standing in her ring, she lured him into it. When he crossed the line, she said:"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='290'>u"and, touching him on the head and back, a horn and a tail grew from the spots touched. He went off in a terrible rage, but she only laughed maliciously. Then, as she heard of the Queen of the Dell"s good deeds, she repented of her evil deeds, and begged her neighbour to go to the queen fairy and ask her if she might come and visit her. The queen consented, and the old witch went down and told her everything--of the book, of the magic wand, of the ring, and of all the wicked deeds she had done."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='291'>"O, you have been a bad witch," said the queen, "but I will see what I can do; but you must bring me the book and the wand;" and she told the old witch to come on the following day a little before noon.

He confided his suspicions to a friend, and they determined to go the next night and watch the mill. The following night, at about midnight, as they approached the mill, that stood on a bare stony hill, they were surprised to find the mill all lit up and at work, the great sails turning in the black night. Creeping up softly to a small window, the miller looked in, and saw a crowd of little men carrying small bags, and emptying them into the millstones. He could not see, however, what was in the bags, so he crept to another window, when he saw golden coins coming from the mill, from the place where the flour usually ran out.</paragraph>

One evening a young man, who was the heir and occupier of this farm, hid himself in a thicket close to the spot where they used to gambol. Presently they appeared, and when in their merry mood, out he bounced from his covert, and seized one of their females; the rest of the company dispersed themselves, and disappeared in an instant. Disregarding her struggles and screams, he hauled her to his home, where he treated her so very kindly that she became contented to live with him as his maid-servant, but he could not prevail upon her to tell him her name. Some time after, happening again to see the fairies upon the same spot, he heard one of them saying, "The last time we met here our sister Penelope was snatched away from us by one of the mortals." Rejoiced at knowing the name of his incognita, he returned home; and as she was very beautiful and extremely active, he proposed to marry her, which she would not for a long time consent to; at last, however, she complied, but on this condition, "That if ever he should strike her with iron, she would leave him, and never return to him again." They lived happy for many years together, and he had by her a son and a daughter; and by her industry and prudent management as a housewife he became one of the richest men in the country. He farmed, besides his own freehold, all the lands on the north side of Nant y Bettws to the top of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='freehold;land;side;y;bettw;top;cwm;brwynog;extent;acre;upward' adjectives='own;north;nant' verbs='farm'>Snowdon</entity>, and all Cwm brwynog in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='freehold;land;side;y;bettw;top;cwm;brwynog;extent;acre;upward' adjectives='own;north;nant' verbs='farm'>Llanberis</entity>, an extent of about five thousand acres or upwards.</paragraph>

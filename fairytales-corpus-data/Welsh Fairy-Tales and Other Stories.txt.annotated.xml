	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>Near the gentleman lived the old witch, and she had the power of turning at will into a hare. The gentleman was a great hare hunter, but the hounds could never catch this hare; it always disappeared in a mill, running between the wings and jumping in at an open window, though they stationed two men and a dog at the spot, when it immediately turned into the old witch. And the old miller never suspected, for the old woman used to take him a peck of corn to grind a few days before any hunt, telling him she would call for it on the afternoon of the day of the hunt. So that when she arrived she was expected.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>One day she had been taunting the gentleman as he returned from a hunt, that he could never catch the hare, and he struck her with his whip, saying "Get away, you witchcraft!"</paragraph>

When they reached the plot they planted the pole in the ground, and hung the mirror on the pole. The queen took the tape, which measured ten yards and was fastened to the top of the pole, and walked round in a circle, and wherever she set her feet the grass withered and died. Then the fairies followed up behind the queen, and each fairy carried a harebell in her left-hand, and a little blue cup of burning perfume in her right. When they had formed up the queen called the lad to her side, and told him to walk by her throughout. They then started off, all singing in chorus:</paragraph>

The vessel lowered within a few hundred feet of the earth, and I saw what I thought were fairies. I thought I had been there for days; in truth, it seemed to me I had been up there for three days, and that I could hear the fairies with mournful sounds drawing a coffin. I watched and watched, and saw seven crows on the coffin. It seemed as if they were going to bury someone. Whilst the coffin was going the seven crows flew up and bursted, and the heavens were illuminated more strongly than by the sun. Then I lost sight of the fairies, but saw some big giants in white walking about, and there was a big throne with a roof to it. And all at once I was in total darkness, but I could hear things flapping about, flying through the air. Then I saw the moon rising and all the stars, and all sorts of objects flying through the air. And one came to me, and put his hand upon my shoulder, saying: _"Prepare to meet us to-morrow."_ After that everything went dark again. The first thing I knew I was in a ship steering, and the seven black crows were in front of me. I had a great trouble to steer my vessel.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='280'>In olden times fairies were sent to oppose the evil-doings of witches, and to destroy their power. About three hundred years ago a band of fairies, sixty in number, with their queen, called Queen of the Dell, came to Mona to oppose the evil works of a celebrated witch. The fairies settled by a spring, in a valley. After having blessed the spring, or "well", as they called it, they built a bower just above the spring for the queen, placing a throne therein. Near by they built a large bower for themselves to live in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='281'>After that, the queen drew three circles, one within the other, on a nice flat grassy place by the well. When they were comfortably settled, the queen sent the fairies about the country to gather tidings of the people. They went from house to house, and everywhere heard great complaints against an old witch; how she had made some blind, others lame, and deformed others by causing a horn to grow out of their foreheads. When they got back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;tell;get' valence='5.71' arousal='3.92' dominance='5.746'>the well</entity> and told <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;tell;get' valence='5.71' arousal='3.92' dominance='5.746'>the queen</entity>, she said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='283'>When the day came, several ailing people collected at the well.

Each little fairy was three feet and a half high, and carried a small wand in her right hand, and a bunch of fairy flowers--cuckoo"s boots, baby"s bells, and day"s-eyes--in her left hand. Then the queen, who was four feet and a half in height, took the outside ring. On her head was a crown of wild flowers, in her right hand she carried a wand, and in her left a posy of fairy flowers.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='288'>Now the old witch who had worked all these evils lived near the well in a cottage.

She progressed rapidly with her studies, and being eager to learn more, sold herself to the devil, who made compact with her that she should have full power for seven years, after which she was to become his. He gave her a wand that had the magic power of drawing people to her, and she had a ring on the grass by her house just like the fairy"s ring. As the seven years were drawing to a close, and her heart was savage against the farmer who first led her into the paths of evil knowledge, she determined to be revenged. One day, soon after the Fairy of the Dell came to live by the spring, she drew the farmer to her with her wand, and, standing in her ring, she lured him into it.

Presently they appeared, and when in their merry mood, out he bounced from his covert, and seized one of their females; the rest of the company dispersed themselves, and disappeared in an instant. Disregarding her struggles and screams, he hauled her to his home, where he treated her so very kindly that she became contented to live with him as his maid-servant, but he could not prevail upon her to tell him her name. Some time after, happening again to see the fairies upon the same spot, he heard one of them saying, "The last time we met here our sister Penelope was snatched away from us by one of the mortals." Rejoiced at knowing the name of his incognita, he returned home; and as she was very beautiful and extremely active, he proposed to marry her, which she would not for a long time consent to; at last, however, she complied, but on this condition, "That if ever he should strike her with iron, she would leave him, and never return to him again."

Go and take it and buy back your estate: marry, and beget an heir."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='465'>""Good God! is this a ghastly joke?" said the prodigal. But the words looked truthful; so he tore down the parchment, dropped through the trap-door, shut it, and readjusted the rope. He left the hut and borrowed a pick and shovel, and returning to the hut, he began to dig, and found one chest full of gold. When he made this discovery he closed the chest, filled in the hole, and spread leaves over the spot. He then ran off to his father"s best friend, and told him of his good luck. They then called in two other friends, and consulted together how the old lord"s wish was best to be carried out. "I"ll tell you," said his father"s oldest friend. "Mr. John o" Scales gives a great dinner party once a month, and three of us here are invited as usual. You must come in in the middle of dinner in your ordinary beggar clothes and beg humbly for some food, when he will give orders to have you turned out. Then you must begin to call him a liar and a thief, and accuse him of robbing your father and yourself of your inheritance. You"ll see he"ll get angry, and offer to let you have it back."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='602'>As told by an old fisherman. The variant of this well-known story may prove useful. Borrow"s "tent" theory is, I think, an invention of his own. I was fortunate enough to get possession of an old book (without title-page, title, or author"s name), in which the following remarks on this story occur:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='603'>"Some say this should be written Bedd Gelert, or Gilert, signifying Gelert"s, or Gilert"s Grave. To this name is annexed a traditional story, which it is hardly worth while to mention. However, the substance of the tradition is, that Prince Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, in a fit of passion, killed a favourite greyhound in this place, named Gelert, or Gilert, and that, repenting of the deed, he caused a tomb to be erected over his grave, where afterwards the parish church was built. See the story at large in Mr. Edw. Jones"s _Welsh Music_. But we may reasonably conclude that this is all a fable, both when we consider the impiety of building a church for divine worship over the grave of a dog, an impiety not consistent with the genius of that age; and when we consider, also, that the establishment of parochial cures, and the building of our country churches in Wales, began soon after the dispersion of the British clergy, which happened at the time of the massacre at Bangor Iscoed, A.D. 603, at the instigation of Augustine the Monk, employed for that purpose by the See of Rome. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='a.d.;parish;time;ap;church;prince' adjectives='' verbs='die;be;build;govern' valence='5.12083333333' arousal='3.91833333333' dominance='5.18833333333'>Llewelyn</entity> ap <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='a.d.;parish;time;ap;church;prince' adjectives='' verbs='die;be;build;govern' valence='5.12083333333' arousal='3.91833333333' dominance='5.18833333333'>Iorwerth</entity> governed <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='a.d.;parish;time;ap;church;prince' adjectives='' verbs='die;be;build;govern' valence='5.12083333333' arousal='3.91833333333' dominance='5.18833333333'>Wales</entity> from A.D. 1194 to 1240, when he died; so that parish churches were built between five and six hundred years before the time of this prince.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='604'>"This Gelert, or Gilert, must, in all probability, have been some old monk or saint of that name, who was interred here, and was either the first founder of this church, or one to whose memory it was dedicated, if built after his time. Bethgelert, before the Reformation, was a priory. Lewis Dwnn, a bard of the fifteenth century, in a poem (the purport of which is to solicit David, the Prior of Bethgelert, to bestow on John Wynne, of Gwydwr, Esq., a fine bay horse which he possessed) extols the Prior for his liberality and learning. Hence we are led to suppose that this monk was very opulent, and a popular character in his time."</paragraph>

After telling the story, which he entitles a fairy story, he makes the following suggestive comments:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='626'>"Before the Reformation, when the Christian world was enveloped in Popish darkness and superstition, when the existence of fairies and other spectres was not questioned, and when such a swarm of idle people, under the names of minstrels, poets, begging friars, etc., were permitted to ramble about, it may be supposed that these vagrants had amongst themselves some kind of rule or government, if I may so term it, as we are assured those that now-a-days go under the name of gypsies have. Such people might, at appointed times on fine moonlight nights, assemble in some sequestered spot, to regulate their dark affairs and divide the spoil; and then perform their nightly _orgies_, so as to terrify people from coming near them, lest their tricks and cheats should be discovered.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='627'>The author makes the following remarks in a foot-note:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='628'>"The English writers of romances feign the fairies to be of a smaller size than even the fabled pigmies; the Welsh people ever supposed them to be of the same stature with mankind. Shakespeare describes his fairy as less than a mite, riding through people"s brains to make the chase. This has not been my experience. I have had them described to me of all sizes, varying from a woman to little people two feet high. They have been described, when large, as dressed like ordinary ladies, when small, with short dresses; no hats, and hair in a plaited pigtail down the back."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='629'>Finally, the writer says:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='630'>"What other interpretation can be given to this tale I know not. This, and such other tales, the material of which one might collect a volume, must, it may reasonably be supposed, have something of reality for their origin and foundation, before they were dressed out in the familiar garb given them by their authors."</paragraph>

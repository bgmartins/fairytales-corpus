	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>"SHOULD YOU ASK ME, WHENCE THESE STORIES?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>The story which runs through and makes up the bulk of this book is my own. The intention has been, however, to make it conform to the laws governing certain beings commonly regarded in this country as mythical, as those laws are revealed in the folk-lore of many peoples, and particularly of the Irish people. Almost every incident in which the fairies are concerned might occur, and very many of them do actually occur, in Irish folk-lore. But in a real folk-tale there are usually only two or three, or, at any rate, only a few, of the characteristic incidents, while this story attempts to combine many of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>The shorter stories wherewith the main story is interspersed are all, to the best of my information and belief, genuine Irish folk-tales. I have told them in my own way, of course. I have sometimes condensed and sometimes elaborated them, but I have seldom, if ever, I think, materially changed their substance. I have never had the opportunity to collect such stories as these for myself, and if I had, I should probably find that I had not the ability. I have therefore had to turn for the substance of these tales to collections made by others--men whose patient and affectionate care and labor have preserved a great mass of the beautiful Irish legends, which, without them, might have died.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='91'>It seems hardly right to give to any one of these collectors a preference over the others by naming him first. But when I count up my indebtedness, I find that the book to which I owe more stories than to any other is Patrick Kennedy"s "Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts." From this book I have borrowed, as to their substance, the story of Earl Gerald, in Chapter II. of my own book; the story of the children of Lir, in the same chapter; the account of the changeling who was tempted by the bagpipes, which Naggeneen tells of himself, in Chapter V.; the changeling story which Mrs. O"Brien tells, in Chapter VI.; and the most of the story of Oisin, in Chapter IX., besides part of the story of the fairies" tune, in Chapter VII. With respect to Oisin I got a little help from an article on "The Neo-Latin Fay," by Henry Charles Coote, in "The Folk-Lore Record," Vol. II. The story of the fairies" tune is in part derived from T. Crofton Croker"s "Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland." This delightful book as well deserves the first place in my list as does Kennedy"s, for it gave me one of my most important stories, that of O"Donoghue, in Chapter I., and it gave me Naggeneen. Him I first saw, with Mr. Croker"s help, sitting on the cask of port in the cellar of old MacCarthy of Ballinacarthy, as he himself describes in Chapter III. It is not enough to say that after that he came readily into my story; he simply could not be kept out of it. The tale of the fairies who wanted to question a priest, in Chapter X., is also from Croker. Mrs. O"Brien"s method of getting rid of a changeling is founded on one of Croker"s stories, and a story almost exactly like it is told by Grimm. There is also a form of it in Brittany. Two books by W.B. Yeats have been of much value--"Irish Fairy and Folk Tales" and "The Celtic Twilight." Of the former Mr. Yeats is the editor, rather than, in a strict sense, the author, though it contains some of his own work, and his introduction, notes, and other comments are of great interest. From this book I have the story of Hudden, Dudden, and Donald, in Chapter VII. Mr. Yeats reproduces it from an old chap-book. A version of it is also found in Samuel Lover"s "Legends and Stories of Ireland." Those who like to compare the stories which they find in various places will not fail to note its likeness to Hans Christian Andersen"s "Big Claus and Little Claus." The story of the monk and the bird, in Chapter IX., Mr. Yeats reproduces from Croker, though not from the work of his which has already been mentioned. I could not resist the temptation to better the story, as I thought, by the addition of an incident from a German version of it, and everybody will remember the beautiful form in which it appears in Longfellow"s "The Golden Legend." From Mr. Yeats"s "The Celtic Twilight" I have the little story of the conversation between the diver and the conger, in Chapter II. It is a pleasure to refer to two such fine and scholarly works as Dr. Douglas Hyde"s "Beside the Fire" and William Larminie"s "West Irish Folk-Tales and Romances." From the former of these I have borrowed the substance of the story of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ghost;chapter;story;substance;wife;vii' adjectives='latter;former' verbs='borrow;have' valence='5.54777777778' arousal='4.20444444444' dominance='5.59444444444'>Guleesh</entity> na <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ghost;chapter;story;substance;wife;vii' adjectives='latter;former' verbs='borrow;have' valence='5.54777777778' arousal='4.20444444444' dominance='5.59444444444'>Guss Dhu</entity>, in Chapter IV., and from the latter that of the ghost and his wives, in Chapter VII.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>Having thus confessed my indebtedness, it would seem that my next duty was to pay it. I fear that I can pay it only with thanks. I have not taken a story from the work of any living collector without his permission. It thus becomes my pleasure, no less than my duty, to express my gratitude to Mr. Yeats for permission to use the stories in "Irish Fairy and Folk Tales" and "The Celtic Twilight;" to Dr. Hyde for his permission to take what I chose from "Beside the Fire," and to Mr. Larminie and his publisher, Elliott Stock, for the same permission with regard to his "West Irish Folk-Tales and Romances." My thanks are equally due to Macmillan &amp; Co., Limited, for permission to take stories from Kennedy"s "Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts," the rights to which they own. I wish to say also that in each of these cases the permission asked has been given with a readiness and a cordiality no less pleasing than the permission itself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>I have learned much concerning the ways of Irish fairies from Lady Wilde"s "Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland" and "Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages of Ireland," and I have gained not a little from the books of William Carleton, especially his "Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry," but from none of these have I taken any considerable part of a story. Indeed I have found help, greater or less, in more books than I can name here.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>It may seem by this time that I am like the lawyer who conceded this and that to his opponent till the judge said: "Do not concede any more; you conceded your whole case long ago." But I have not conceded my whole case. I have used the threads which others have spun, but I have done my own weaving. The shorter stories have been told before, but they have never been put together in this way before, and, as I said at first, the main story is my own.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='108'>It was in a poor little cabin somewhere in Ireland. It does not matter where. The walls were of rough stone, the roof was of thatch, and the floor was the hard earth. There was very little furniture. Poor as it was, the whole place was clean. It is right to tell this, because, unhappily, a good many cabins in Ireland are not clean. What furniture there was had been rubbed smooth and spotless, and the few dishes that there were fairly shone. <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;sweep;expect' valence='5.87333333333' arousal='3.99833333333' dominance='5.68'>The floor</entity> was as carefully swept as if the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;sweep;expect' valence='5.87333333333' arousal='3.99833333333' dominance='5.68'>Queen</entity> were expected.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>The three persons who lived in the cabin had eaten their supper of potatoes and milk and were sitting before the turf fire. It had been a poor supper, yet a little of it that was left--a few potatoes, a little milk, and a dish of fresh water--had been placed on a bench outside the door. There was no light except that of the fire. There was no need of any other, and there was no money to spend on candles that were not needed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='110'>The three who sat before the fire, and needed no other light, were a young man, a young woman, and an elderly woman. She did not like to be called old, for she said, and quite truly, that sixty was not old for anybody who felt as young as she did. This woman was Mrs. O"Brien. The young man was her son, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wife;son;young-woman;man' adjectives='young' verbs='be' valence='6.28333333333' arousal='3.99166666667' dominance='5.42333333333'>John</entity>, and the young-woman was his wife, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wife;son;young-woman;man' adjectives='young' verbs='be' valence='6.28333333333' arousal='3.99166666667' dominance='5.42333333333'>Kitty</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>"Kitty," said John, "it"s not well you"re lookin" to-night. Are ye feelin" anyways worse than common?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='112'>"It"s only a bit tired I am," said Kitty, "wid the work I was afther doin" all day. I"ll be as well as ever in the morning."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>"It"s a shame, that it is," said John, "that ye have to be workin" that way, day afther day, and you not sthrong at all. It"s a shame that I can"t do enough for the three of us, and the more, maybe, that there"ll be, but you must be at it, too, all the time."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>"What nonsinse ye"re talkin", John," Kitty answered. "What would I be doin", settin" up here like a lady, doin" nothin", and you and mother workin" away like you was my servants? Did you think it was a duchess or the daughter of the Lord Lieutenant ye was marryin", that ye"re talkin" that way?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='115'>"And it"ll be worse a long time before it"s betther," John went on. "Wid the three of us workin" all the time, we just barely get along. And it"s the end of the summer now. What we"ll do at all when the winter comes, I dunno."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='116'>The older woman listened to the others and said nothing. Perhaps she had heard such talk as this so many times that she did not care to join in it again, or perhaps she was waiting to be asked to speak. For it was to her that these younger people always turned when they were in trouble. It was her advice and her opinion that they always asked when they felt that they needed a better opinion than their own. The three sat silent now for a time, and then John broke out, as if the talk had been going on in his mind all the while: "What"s the good of us tryin" to live at all?" he said. "Is livin" any use to us? We do nothin" but work all day, and eat a little to give us the strength to work the next day, and then we sleep all night, if we can sleep. And it"s that and nothing else all the year through. Are we any better when the year ends than we were when it began? If we"ve paid the rent, we"ve done well. We never do more."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='117'>"John," the old woman answered, "it"s not for us to say why we"re here or what for we"re living. It"s God that put us here, and He"ll keep us here till it"s our time to go. He has made it the way of all His creatures to provide for themselves and for their own, and to keep themselves alive while they can. When He"s ready for us to die, we die. That"s all we know. The rest is with Him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='118'>"I know all that"s true, mother," said John; "but what is there for us to hope for, that we"ld wish to live? It"s nothing but work to keep the roof over us. We don"t even eat for any pleasure that"s in it--only so that we can work. If we rested for a day, we"ld be driven out of our house. If we rested for another day, we"ld starve. Is there any good to be hoped for such as us? Will there ever be any good times for Ireland? I mean for all the people in it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='119'>"There will," the old woman said. "Everything has an end, and so these troubles of ours will end, and all the troubles of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='everything;trouble;end' adjectives='' verbs='end;have' valence='4.60333333333' arousal='4.15' dominance='5.09666666667'>Ireland</entity> will end, too."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='120'>"And why should we believe that?" John asked again. "Wasn"t <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='people;country;agent;t;landlord;wasn' adjectives='poor;better;unhappy' verbs='be;think' valence='4.926' arousal='3.971' dominance='5.336'>Ireland</entity> always the poor, unhappy country, and all the people in it, only the landlords and the agents, and why should we think it will ever be better?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='121'>"Everything has an end," the old woman repeated. "Ireland was not always the unhappy country. It was happy once and it will be happy again. It"s not you, John O"Brien, that ought to be forgetting the good days of Ireland, long ago though they were. For you yourself are the descendant of King Brian Boru, and you know well, for it"s many times I"ve told you, how in his days the country was happy and peaceful and blessed. He drove out the heathen and saved the country for his people. He had strict laws, and the people obeyed them. In his days a lovely girl, dressed all in fine silk and gold and jewels, walked alone the length of Ireland, and there was no one to rob her or to harm her, because of the good King and the love the people had for him and for his laws. And you, that are descended from <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='country;t;wasn' adjectives='poor;unhappy' verbs='ask;be;descend' valence='4.93125' arousal='4.12625' dominance='5.2225'>King Brian</entity>, ask if <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='country;t;wasn' adjectives='poor;unhappy' verbs='ask;be;descend' valence='4.93125' arousal='4.12625' dominance='5.2225'>Ireland</entity> wasn"t always the poor, unhappy country."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='122'>"But all that was so long ago," said John; "near a thousand years, was it not? Since then it"s been nothing but sorrow for the country and for the people. What good is it to us that the country was happy in King Brian"s time? Will that help us pay the rent? And how we"ll pay the rent when the winter comes, I dunno, and if we don"t pay it we"ll be evicted."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='123'>"Shaun," said his mother, calling him by the Irish name that she used sometimes--"Shaun, we"ll not be evicted; never fear that. Things are bad, and they may be worse, but take my word, whatever comes, we"ll not be evicted."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='124'>"Mother," said the young man, "you never spoke the word, so far as I know, that wasn"t true, but I dunno how it"ll be this time. We"ve been workin" all we can and we only just manage to pay the rent and live, and here"s the summer over and the winter coming, and how will we pay the rent then?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='125'>The mother did not answer this question directly. She began talking in a way that did not seem to have anything to do with the rent, though it really had something to do with it, in her own mind, and perhaps in her son"s mind too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>"It"s over-tired that you are with your hard day"s work, Shaun," she said, "and that and seeing Kitty so tired, too, has maybe made you look at things a little worse than they are. We"ve never been so bad off as many of our neighbors; you know that. And yet I know it"s been worse of late and harder for you than it might have been, and you can"t remember the better times that our family had, and that"s why you forget that the times were ever better. No, you wasn"t born then, but the time was when good luck seemed to follow your father and me everywhere and always. Yes, and the good luck has not all left us yet, though we had the bad luck to lose your father so long ago. We could not hope to be rich or happy while the whole country was in such distress as it"s been sometimes, yet there were always many that were worse off than we, and when I think of those days of "47 and "48 it makes the sorrows seem light that we"re suffering now. And I always know that whatever comes, there"ll be some good for me and mine while I live. I"ve told you how I know that, but you always forget, and I must tell you again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='127'>They had not forgotten. They knew the story that was coming by heart, but they knew that the old woman liked to tell it, so they let her go on and said not a word.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='128'>For a little while, too, the old woman said not a word. She sat with her eyes closed, and smiling, as if she were in a dream. Then she began to speak softly, as if she were still only just waking out of a dream. "Blessed days there were," she said--"blessed days for Ireland once--long ago--many hundreds of years. O"Donoghue--it was he was the good King, and happy were his people. A fierce warrior he was to guard them from their enemies, and a just ruler to those who minded his laws. It was in the West that he ruled, by the beautiful Lakes of Killarney. The rich and the poor among his people were alike in one thing--they all had justice. He punished even his own son when he did wrong, as if he had been a poor man and a stranger.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='129'>"He gave grand feasts to his friends, and the greatest and the best men of all Erin came to sit at his table and to hear the wise words that he spoke. And the greatest bards of all Erin came to sing before him and his guests of the brave deeds of the heroes of old days and of the greatness and the goodness of O"Donoghue himself. At one of these feasts, after a bard had been singing of the noble days of Erin long ago, O"Donoghue began to speak of the years that were to come for Ireland. He told of much good and of much evil. He told how true and brave and noble men would live and work and fight and die for their country, and how cowards would betray her. He told of glory and he told of shame. He spoke of riches and honor, and poetry and beauty; he spoke of want and disgrace, and degradation and sorrow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>"Those who sat at his table listened to him in wonder. Sometimes their hearts swelled with pride at the noble lives and deeds of those who were to come after them, sometimes they wept at the sufferings that their children were to feel, and sometimes they hid their faces from each other in shame at the tales of cowardice and of treachery.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='132'>"As he finished speaking he rose from the table, crossed the hall, and walked out at the door and down to the shore of the lake. The others followed him and watched him, full of wonder. They saw him go to the edge of the lake and then walk out upon it, as if the water had been firm ground under his feet. He walked far and far out on the bright lake as they stood and gazed at him. Then he turned toward them, he waved his hand in farewell, and he was gone. They saw him no more."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='133'>The old woman paused for a moment and the dreaming look came back to her face. Then she went on. "They saw him no more--but others saw him--and I have seen him. Every year, on the 1st of May, just as the sun is rising, he rides across the lake on his beautiful white horse. He is not always seen, but sometimes a few can see him. And it always brings good luck to see O"Donoghue riding across the lake on May morning. And I saw him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='134'>Again there was a pause, but she had no look of dreaming now. Her eyes were open and she seemed to be looking at something wonderful and beautiful that was far off. Slowly and softly she began speaking again. "I was a girl then. My father lived by the Lakes of Killarney. On that May morning I was standing at the door as the sun was rising. I was looking out upon the lake, far away to the east. The first that I saw was that the water, far off toward the sun, was ruffled, and then all at once a great, white-crested wave rose, as if a strong wind had struck the water, only all the air was still, and no wind ever raises such a wave as that on the lake. The wave came swiftly toward me, and I drew back, in a kind of dread, though I knew that it could not reach me where I stood. But still I looked--and then I saw him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='135'>"Through the flying water and foam and mist I saw the old King, on his white horse, following the great wave across the lake. The sun made all his armor gleam like the silver of the lake itself, and the plume of his helmet streamed away behind him like the spray that a strong wind blows back from the crest of a breaker. After him came a train of glowing, beautiful forms--spirits of the lake or of the air, or some of the Good People--I do not know. They wore soft, flowing garments, that were like the morning mists; they carried chains of pearls and they scattered other pearls about them, that glistened like the drops of a shower when the sun is shining through it. They had garlands of flowers, and they plucked the flowers out and threw them high in the air, so that they fell before the King. They looked like flecks of foam from the waves, turned rosy and violet by the rising sun, but they were flowers. And there was a sound of sweet, soft music, like harps and mellow horns.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='136'>"The King and his train came nearer and I saw them plainer, and the music sounded louder. Then they passed me and moved far away again on the lake. The sight of them grew dim and the music grew faint, and I strained my eyes and my ears for the last of them, and they were gone. Then I could move and speak and breathe again, for it had seemed to me that I could not do any one of these things while <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;o;donoghue' adjectives='' verbs='breathe;do;be;move;see;know;have;pass;seem;speak' valence='5.6625' arousal='4.024' dominance='5.4055'>the King</entity> was passing, and I knew that I had seen O"Donoghue."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='137'>The old woman stopped, as if the story were ended, but the younger people did not speak, for they knew that she had something else to tell. "O"Donoghue had passed and was gone," she said, "but he always leaves good luck behind him, and he left the good luck with me. That summer some rich young ladies came from Dublin to see the Lakes of Killarney. They heard the story of O"Donoghue, and the people told them that I was the last who had seen him. They came to my father"s house and asked me to tell them what I had seen. They seemed pleased with what I told them, or with something that they saw in me, and they asked my father to let them take me back to the city with them, for a lady"s maid. He did not like to let me go, but they said that they would pay me well and would have me taught better than I could be at home. He was poor, there were others at home who needed all that he could earn, I wished to go, and at last he said I might.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='138'>"So I went to Dublin and lived in a grand house, among grand people. I tried to do my duties well, and they were kind to me. They kept the promise that they had made to my father. They gave me books and allowed me time to study them, and they helped me in things that I could not well have learned by myself, even with the books. I was quick at study, and in the little time that I had, I learned all that I could. Three times they took me to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='life;people;time' adjectives='grander' verbs='see;take' valence='5.3375' arousal='4.32875' dominance='5.295'>London</entity> with them, and I saw still grander people and grander life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='139'>"Those were happy days, but happier came. Your father came, Shaun. He was a servant of the family, like myself--a coachman. But he was wiser than I, and he talked with me and showed me that there was something better for us than to be servants always. We saved all the money that we could, and when we had enough we came here, where your father had lived before, and took a little farm. The luck of O"Donoghue was always with us. We had a good landlord, who asked a fair rent. We both worked hard, we saved more money and took more land, and all our neighbors thought that we were prosperous, and so we were.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='140'>"Then came "47. Nobody could be prosperous then. Nobody that had a heart in him at all could even keep what he had saved then. What we had and what our neighbors had belonged to all, and little enough there was of it. It is well for you young people to talk of these times being hard. Harder than some they may be, but good and easy compared with those days of "47 and "48. You talk of injustice and wrong to Ireland! What think you of those times, when every day great ships sailed away from Ireland loaded down with food--corn and bacon, and beef and butter--and Ireland"s own people left without the bit of food to keep the life in them? All summer long was the horrible wet weather, and the potatoes rotting in the ground before they"ld be ripe, and never fit to eat. To add to all that was the fever, that killed its thousands, and then the cold. And when the days came again that the crops would grow, many and many of the people were so weak with the hunger and the sickness that they could not work in the fields. Ah! and you call these hard times!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='141'>"Those were the bad days for Ireland, those days of "47. Not even the luck of O"Donoghue could make us prosper or give us comforts then. But we lived through the time, as many others did. The poor helped those who were poorer than themselves; the sick tended those who were sicker; the cold gave clothes and fire to those who were colder. The little money that we had saved helped us and some of our neighbors. And we lived through it all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='142'>"Better times came, though never again so good as the old. We worked again and we saved a trifle. Then you were born to us, John. We had a worse landlord now.

The rent was raised, and we never could have paid it but for the care and the skill and the hard work of your father.

It"s not any gold or any riches I"m thinkin" about, but what I want to know, mother, is this: Could a man in the States, if he was strong and if he worked hard--and if he didn"t drink a great deal--could he make enough to keep himself and his wife both, so that she needn"t work too hard--not so that she would sit idle, I don"t mean, but so that she needn"t be doin" hard work and doin" it all the time--could he do that?"</paragraph>

Could one do enough for three?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='178'>"It would be easier than here, maybe," was all that the old woman said in answer to this. She had heard this talk of America many times before, and she did not like it. She would rather believe, and make others believe, that better times were coming for Ireland. She was not so young as the others and not so ready to leave her old home, yet lately she had seen how it was growing harder and harder to stay, and there seemed to be little left of the good luck of which she boasted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='179'>She was thinking of all this now, and John knew her thoughts, though she did not speak them, and he said: "You always tell us that there"s betther times comin", mother, and I"ve learned to know that all you say is true.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='180'>Again Mrs. O"Brien seemed lost in deep thought, or in a dream, just as when, a little while before, she had told them of O"Donoghue. What she told them now was a sort of answer to John"s question, but perhaps she told it quite as much to draw their thoughts away from America. She was silent for a little while, and they all waited for her to speak.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='181'>"Good times for Ireland there will be again," she said, "when Earl Gerald comes back. It was hundreds of years ago that Earl Gerald lived in his great castle of Mullaghmast. He was a strong warrior and he fought many a good fight for his people against their foes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='182'>"His wife knew that he could do this, but he had never shown himself to her in any form but his own. She often begged him to let her see what his magic could do, and to change himself to some other form for her. But he knew there was danger in it, and he put her off with one reason and another.

It troubled her so much that she began to lose her beauty and her health, and at last she took to her bed and did not leave it for a year. And after that time there came a great Druid to visit her. You know who and what the Druids were, I think. They were the priests of the old religion of Ireland, before St. Patrick came and made the people Christians. They were powerful in magic; they could bring storms and could drive them away; they could foretell the future; they could work powerful enchantments on people and beasts, and trees and stones, and they could do many other marvellous things.</paragraph>

But Fair-shoulder believed that she meant them some harm, and she refused to go, and begged her brothers not to go. So the step-mother called her men, and she and they forced the children out of the chariot and pushed them into the water.

Then he said to the people: "This creature that was my daughter has laid a wicked enchantment on her husband"s children. She has changed them into swans. They must keep that shape for many hundreds of years; they must swim in the lakes and the seas and fly over the land, and they must travel far and must suffer much. But there is a hope for them. Many, many hundred years will pass away--so many that even the Druid"s eye can scarcely see what is at the end of them. But at last there shall come strange men across the sea to Erin--men with shaven heads. They shall build houses and shall set up tables in the east ends of their houses, and they shall ring bells. And when the swans that were the children of Lir shall hear the first sound of these bells, they shall have their human shape again, and then they shall be happy forever. But she--the gray vulture--she shall fly in the sky, where it is stormy and cold. Where there are thick clouds and where the rain is made, there shall be her home. She shall not fly where the heaven is blue and where the sun shines warm. The bells of the good men from over the sea shall bring her no peace. Her way shall be with the wind and the hail. If she has any rest it shall be on the peak of some wet crag, where the snow whirls around her, or the fog drives past her, or the sleet cuts against her, or the cold spray of the sea dashes over her. And it shall be so with her till the Day of Doom."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='209'>"When the King had finished speaking the gray vulture flew away, and she was never seen again. But the King and all the court rode in chariots to the lake where the white swans were, and Lir and all his people came there, too, when they heard what had been done. And there they all stood and listened to the singing of the four swans. So beautiful was the song that those who listened could think of nothing else while they heard it. They left their horses and their chariots and stood on the shore of the lake and listened to the enchanting music, and never thought of food, or of drink, or of sleep. Even the horses listened to the song as the people did. Day and night they stood there, and many days and nights, and no hunger came upon them, and they felt no cold and no heat, and no wind and no wet.</paragraph>

In the summer the lake was pleasant and cool, the air was clear and mild, the sky was blue, and the sun was bright and beautiful. Then Fair-shoulder and her brothers forgot that they were unhappy. They sang songs to one another and scarcely remembered that they had ever been anything but swans, swimming on this peaceful water. But when the winter came and the ice was all around, and the wind from the north blew the snow against them, so that it froze among their feathers and they could scarcely move, they were so stiff and so cold--then they remembered how happy they had been in their father"s castle. They could not sing now--not even sad songs. They only longed to have their human shape again and to be back in their old home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='212'>"But after many, many years more had passed they ceased to wish for home. They had been swans so long now that it did not seem to them that they had ever been anything else. When the winter came again and again and again, and the days of chilling storm and the nights of freezing darkness were upon them, the poor brothers longed for nothing but the end of it all. The thought of the old castle hall, with its bright fires and its feasts and its music of minstrels and its dances and its games, was only another pain to them, and they wished only to die and to leave their sorrows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='213'>"Then they crowded close together, to be as warm as they could, and Fair-shoulder tried to spread her wings over her brothers, to keep the storm from them.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='214'>"For three hundred years they were at Loch Derg, and then, by the power of their enchantment, they were compelled to leave it. They flew to the sea of Moyle, and there they stayed, through the summer"s heat and the winter"s cold, for three hundred years more. Still the sister told her brothers of the strange men who were to come to Erin and of the bells that were to free them. But they could not be comforted. The strange men were too long in coming.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='215'>"When the three hundred years were past they had to fly away again to another sea. As they flew, they passed over the spot where their father"s castle had stood and where they had been happy children together. Not a stone of the beautiful castle could they see. It had all crumbled down, and the grass had grown over it for many a year. They saw the fox that had its hole where their father"s bright hearth fire had been, and they saw the ditch of dirty water where their father used to welcome kings and bards and wise men at his gate. They kept their way through the air and saw no more; yet they had seen all that there was to see. It gave the poor swans only a little ache at the heart, for they were past hope now. They had suffered too much to believe anything or to think of anything but the suffering that was past and the more suffering that was to come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='216'>"The end of their journey came and they swam in a new sea. Again the sister tried to cheer her brothers, but they could not be cheered. The strange men with the shaven heads would never come, they thought. They had waited for them too long.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='217'>"But the hundreds of years that had passed had done more than to bring sorrow to the poor swans. In lands far away a new faith had grown up, not like the Druids" faith. And at last across the sea to Erin came the holy St. Patrick. He brought monks with him, and they had shaven heads. They went about the island and preached, and built chapels. In the east end of each chapel they set up an altar, and they said masses and rang bells. And they built a chapel on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='isle;glory;chapel' adjectives='' verbs='be;call;build;have' valence='6.21111111111' arousal='3.87444444444' dominance='5.45888888889'>the island</entity> that has since been called the Isle of Glory.</paragraph>

Fair-shoulder was a beautiful young girl again, and the brothers were strong, beautiful boys. They walked up to the little chapel together, and there a monk baptized them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='219'>"And as soon as they were baptized they were young and strong no longer. Fair-shoulder was an old, old woman, and her brothers were old, old men.

It was because it had been a land of joy as well to me that we all stayed here; and now, since you"re sure that it"s right and best for you to go, it"s not the want of money that shall stand in your way. It"s yourself knows, John, that your father--Heaven be his bed!--was always the careful and the saving man, and I always tried to help him the best I could. The times got a little better with us, as you know, after those worst ones in "47 and "48, and we saved a little again--it was not much, but it was something. Your father left it with me before he died, and he said: "Keep it always by you till you need it most. Don"t use it till the time comes when you can say, "I shall never need this money more than I need it now."" So I have always kept it, and I have it now. That was why I told you not to fear about the winter. It would have paid our rent if all else had failed, and it would have taken us all through the winter. But it"s better that it should take us to the States. If we stayed here and used the money, we"ld be as bad off in another year. Kitty will be getting strong again there, and it"ll be better for all of us. The time that your father said has come; I"m sure we"ll never be needing the money that he left more than we"re needing it now. There"s no more to be said; we"ll go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='230'>For a little while no more was said. John and Kitty gazed at the old woman in wonder. The thing that they had thought about for so long, and wished for as a happiness that could never be, was come to them. And now it scarcely seemed a happiness; it was half a sorrow. Then Ellen spoke: "Oh, Mrs. O"Brien, it was always you was the good neighbor to us! It was always you was with us in joy and in sorrow! What"ll we ever do at all when you"re gone and we"re left here alone, with none to be so kind to us as you"ve always been?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='231'>And Peter said: "I was thinkin" that same. The Lord go wid you and keep you, wherever you go, but it"ll be the sad day for us when you go away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='232'>"Peter and Ellen," said the old woman "how could you think that we"ld do a thing like that? You may be a fool sometimes, Peter, but you"re your father"s son. Do you know what your father did for us, Peter? When my John was dying with the fever, he sat and watched with him, and brought him the water and the whey all night, and night after night, when I was so worn out that I could watch no longer. He might have taken the fever himself, and he might have died with it, and he did take it, but the Lord spared his life for a while after that, Heaven rest his soul! And another thing that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;bit;drop;penny' adjectives='more' verbs='be;buy;want;die;drink;say;let;have;eat' valence='5.51555555556' arousal='4.60777777778' dominance='5.51611111111'>John</entity> said to me before he died was this: "As long as you have a bit to eat or a drop to drink or a penny to buy, never let <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;bit;drop;penny' adjectives='more' verbs='be;buy;want;die;drink;say;let;have;eat' valence='5.51555555556' arousal='4.60777777778' dominance='5.51611111111'>Tom Sullivan</entity> or any of his want more than you want yourself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='233'>"And so, Peter and Ellen, when we go to the States, you"ll both go too. There"s enough of the money to take us all there. If you"re ever able to pay it back, you can do it, if you like; but if not, we"ll never ask you for it. If we went away from here without you, my husband would look down from Heaven and see me doing what he told me, with his dying breath, never to do. He would come to me at night and he would say: "Mary, you are deserting in their sorrow the children of them that never deserted us in our sorrow." Do you think that I could bear that?

They had talked of it many times, but Mrs. O"Brien had never given the word that they should go. The rest of them talked on and on of what they wished. But when she spoke, they all knew that she spoke of what was to be. They knew now that they should never talk of going again, but they should go.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='244'>THE LITTLE GOOD PEOPLE</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='245'>There was a good deal of commotion that night in the rath near where the O"Briens and the Sullivans lived. Do you know what a rath is? I suppose not. It is hard work to tell stories to you, you are so ignorant. I will tell you what a rath is. First I will tell you what it looks like. It looks like a mound of earth, in the shape of a ring, covered with turf, and perhaps with bushes. They are found all over Ireland. Some people, who have studied so much that they have lost all track of what they know and of what they don"t know, say that these raths were made by the people who lived in Ireland many hundreds of years ago, and that they were strongholds to guard themselves and their sheep and their cattle from their enemies or from wild beasts. But people who know as much as Mrs. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fairy;place;mrs.;people' adjectives='good;much' verbs='be;live;call;know' valence='6.39333333333' arousal='3.87333333333' dominance='5.8525'>O `` Brien</entity>, know that they are the places where the fairies live, or the Good People, as she would call them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='246'>On this night that I have been telling you about, the Good People inside the rath were eating and drinking and dancing and making merry generally, as they do, you know, the most of the time. Perhaps you would like to have me tell you how the inside of the rath looked too. I will do the best I can. In the first place, the walls were all of silver and the floor was all of gold. Perhaps you don"t know--no, I suppose you don"t know--still you may happen to have heard of this before: the fairies know just where to find pretty much all the gold and silver and precious stones that there are in the world, if they happen to want them. They don"t want much of them, of course--only just enough to make the walls and the roofs and the floors of their houses of, and to put all over their clothes and to make all their furniture and dishes of, and all their carriages and their boats, and a few other things--but they know where to find plenty of gold and silver, if they want it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='247'>Now I think that I had better give you a little science. I believe that a book which children are to read, always ought to teach something, so I mean to teach you as much as I can. You must know, then, that gold is one of the heaviest things in the world. Now you know that the earth is always whirling round and round, so that the things that it is made of naturally get shaken up more or less. Besides that, it was once a good deal softer than it is now, so that the things that it is made of could move about more than they can now. And so the most of the gold, being, as I said, one of the heaviest things, got sifted down toward the bottom--that is, toward the centre of the earth. Only a little of it was left near the top, compared with what went to the bottom. It would not be at all surprising if the middle of the earth were a solid lump of gold, a thousand miles thick. But we poor men cannot dig down very deep into the earth. We can only scratch a little dirt off the top, and if we happen to grub up a few pounds of gold we think that we are rich, and the rest of the world thinks so too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='248'>But the fairies laugh at us. They know how to go as deep into the earth as they choose, and so any fairy who chooses can give away gold all his life, and still have more of it in his dust-bin all the time than all the kings in the world have in their treasuries. And the other fairies don"t call him rich.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='249'>But now we will go back to the rath. Of course it was all under the ground, so that there was no daylight. At the time we are talking about, there would not have been any anyway, for it was night. The place was lighted up with thousands of diamonds and rubies and emeralds, which were set all over the ceiling and shone like lamps. Now I won"t call you ignorant just because you say that you don"t understand how diamonds could light up anything, for I don"t understand it myself. Let us talk about it together and try to decide. Suppose you try the experiment. Some night, after dark, take all the diamonds you have--every one of them--and carry them into a dark room and spread them out, and see if they light up the room at all. I am sure that you will find that they do not. On the contrary, if you let go of them, you will have to go and get a light to hunt for them by. But I suppose the fairies have some other kind of diamonds than ours, or else they know some other way of using the same kind. Sometimes they use fireflies, caught in spider-web nets, but these are generally for out of doors. To light up their houses they almost always use diamonds.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='250'>There were two tiny bits of turf fire in the rath. One of them was at one end of the hall, where the King sat, for the King to light his pipe by, and the other was at the other end, for the other fairy men to light their pipes by. Fairies do not like fire, as a rule, and they would never have any more of it about than they could help. But I know that they must have had some, for I know that Irish fairies smoke pipes, and how could they light them unless they kept a little fire on hand?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='251'>Now, I know what you will say to that. You will say: "If they could light a room with diamonds, why couldn"t they light pipes with them?" Well, that is not very easy to answer, but I feel sure that even a fairy would never think of lighting a pipe with a diamond. I have owned up already that I don"t know exactly how they light rooms with them, but it is easier for me to imagine a diamond giving light than giving heat. Isn"t it for you? Now, be honest about it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='252'>At one end of the hall sat the King and the Queen, on their thrones. Near them were half a dozen fairy men who were playing on pipes and fiddles. All over the floor there were dozens and scores of fairies, men and women, dancing to the music. All around the walls stood or sat many more of them, looking at the dancers, and now and then applauding and shouting at particular ones, or talking together, or simply smoking their pipes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='253'>Suddenly two fairies rushed into the hall, with a little sound like the noise of a humming-bird"s wings when it passes close to you. From the lower end of the hall, where they came in, they went straight through the crowd to where the King and Queen sat. They dropped on their knees before them for an instant, and then rose and spoke to them. In a moment the King clapped his hands, with a sign for the pipers and the fiddlers to stop playing. The instant that they stopped, everybody in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='everybody;instant' adjectives='' verbs='be;stop' valence='5.66' arousal='3.6175' dominance='5.25'>the hall</entity> was still.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='260'>"Is that it?" said the King. "It"s that divil Naggeneen that"s in it.

A fine man he was; we don"t see his like now. I lived wid him the most of the time--in the cellar. And the strange thing about him was that, though nobody ever had a bad word for him, though all his servants said that he was the kindest and the best masther that ever stepped, he could get nobody to stay in the place of butler. It was all well enough wid the rest--cooks, maids, hostlers, stable boys--but the first time ever a new butler went into that beautiful wine cellar for wine, back he"ld come in a hurry and say that he"ld lave his place the next day, and nothing on earth would keep him in it.

He will not be gone much more than a minute. What I have to say is this: Nearly all the people in this story, mortals and fairies, too, had the way of speaking that most Irish people have, which we call a brogue. Mrs. O"Brien had only a little of it--just the bit of a soft brogue that comes from Dublin, where she had lived for a long time. The most of the others had a good deal more. But as I go on with the story from here, I see no use in trying to write the brogue. It is hard to spell and confusing to read. If you do not know what a good Irish brogue is, you would never learn from any attempt of mine to spell it out for you; and if you do know what it is, you can put it in for yourself. I may have to try to write a little of it now and then, for there is some Irish that does not look like Irish when it is written in English, but I shall use as little of it after this as I can.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='319'>Naggeneen had scarcely said this when the door flew open at the end of the hall, and, with a rush and a whirl, in came a great troupe of fairies on horseback--the King of All Ireland and his men.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='323'>"Sure, Your Majesty," said the King of the rath, "I thought it was no harm.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='331'>"As you say, Your Majesty," Naggeneen went on, "but, anyway, I was a lepracaun, and I did what any other lepracaun does: I sat in the field or under a tree and made brogues. But it was sorry work and people was always trying to catch me, to make me show them the gold they thought I had. And one time a great brute of a spalpeen did catch me, and he nearly broke me in two with the squeeze he gave me, so that I wouldn"t get away till I"d showed him the gold.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='337'>He took one of the little green rushes from the floor and sat astride it, as a little boy rides on his father"s cane. "Borram, borram, borram!" he said, and instantly the rush was a beautiful white horse. Every one of his men did the same. Each one took one of the rushes and sat astride of it and said, "Borram, borram, borram!" and every one of the rushes grew into a horse. There was a little whirring sound, like that of a swarm of bees, and they were all gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='338'>Everybody in the rath was silent for a few minutes. The King and the Queen looked at each other and were much troubled. Naggeneen, without making a bit of noise, scuttled down to the farthest corner of the hall. The others seemed not to know where to look or what to do or to think. Then the King turned toward them and said; "It"s all over; we couldn"t stay here now. Wherever has Naggeneen got to?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='339'>The fairies who were nearest to Naggeneen hustled him forward and he stood before the King again. "Naggeneen," said the King, "it"s trouble enough you"ve made for all of us, and it"s ballyragging enough you and all the rest of us have got for it, and we don"t know, as His Majesty said, what more is to come. So now do the only thing you was ever good for and give us a tune out of the fiddle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='340'>It was the only thing that Naggeneen was good for, and the only thing that was not mischief that he liked to do. He took a fiddle from one of the fairies who had been playing for the dancing before all the confusion began. He held the fiddle under his chin for a moment, while everybody waited, and then he began to play.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='341'>He played first some old tunes that every fairy in Ireland knows well. But not every fairy in Ireland can play them as Naggeneen did. They were tunes which everybody listening in that rath had known for hundreds of years. There were wild and strange airs that made them remember days when Ireland was a strange country, even to them; then the music was full of wonder and mystery, like the spells of the old Druids; then it was strong and free and fierce, and they thought of Finn McCool and the Fenians, and the days when Erin had heroes to guard her from her foes. The fiddle was telling them the story of their own lives and of all that they had ever seen and known. Now it was a strange music, which they could not understand--which the player could understand as little as the rest--but it was soft and sweet, and yet deep and bold, and the fairies trembled as they remembered the holy Patrick and a mighty power in the worlds of the seen and of the unseen. This passed away and the music came with the stir and the swing of marching men, and the fairies were again in the days of King Brian Boru, with Ireland free and brave and strong. It grew sad; it gushed out like sobs from a broken heart; then it was quieter, but still full of a softer sorrow; now it was merry and reckless. It made the fairies remember all that they had ever seen in the lives of the people whom they had known so long--the cruel hardship, war, sickness, hunger, and then, besides, the faith, the kindliness, the light-heartedness that had saved them through it all. There were tunes that every man and woman in Ireland knows--tunes that you know--old airs that every Irish fiddler or piper or singer learns from the older ones, that the oldest ones of all learned, they say, from the fairies. And under all the music, whether grave or gay, there went a strain of grief, sometimes almost harsh and sometimes scarcely heard, and as the fairies listened to it they grew pale at the thought that now they were to go away from all that they had known, to find something which they did not know. While they were thinking of this the music changed again. It was a soft murmur, like the sound of the sea that is kept forever in a sea-shell. Then it grew loud and rough, with the rush of winds and the crash of waves. The fairies were filled with fright, and before they knew that they were afraid, the music was singing a song of hope, and then, all at once, it grew as merry as if there had never been a sad thought in the world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='342'>For a moment the fairies listened to it and all their feet began to stir restlessly on the floor. One of the fairy men caught the hand of a fairy girl--a fairy girl with cheeks like the tiny petals in the heart of a rose, with a white gown like a mist, and hair like fine sunbeams falling on the mist; he threw his arm about her waist, and they danced away down the hall. In an instant all the rest were dancing, too, alone, in pairs, and in rings. Naggeneen looked on and laughed till he could scarcely play. All this time his music had moved him less than anybody else who heard it. He did not feel what he had made the others feel, but he knew how to pour it all out of his fiddle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='343'>The King made a sign for him to stop. All the dancers were still in an instant. The lights in the hall went out. The next minute, if you had been outside the rath and had laid your ear down on the turf which covered it, you would have heard nothing more than you might hear under the turf at any other time or in any other place.</paragraph>

To see and to feel the best of it, you must be down in the Narrows, or somewhere near there. The fierce heat has gone out of the air, but there is a gentle warmth left in it.

Far up the bay you see just an end of the city, with the tall buildings standing so close that it looks like one great castle, built all over a hill that slopes steeply down to the water on both sides. The Bridge looks like a spider"s web, spun across to the other shore. Beyond it all the hills look purple, through the thin mist. If, instead of having seen all this often, you saw it for the first time--if you were coming from a far country, where you had always been poor--if you had toiled all your life to pay your rent, never expecting to do more--then perhaps you would look, more than anything else, at <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='standing;life;woman;anything;country;torch;sky;rent;time;world' adjectives='poor;high;more' verbs='be;look;do;pay;see;expect;have;light;toil;hold;come' valence='5.76068965517' arousal='4.1475862069' dominance='5.62965517241'>the giant</entity> woman standing before you and holding her torch high into the sky to light the world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='349'>It was on such a day as this that the O"Briens and the Sullivans saw New York first. It was on the same day that the fairies who had left the rath and followed them saw it too. The O"Briens and the Sullivans had left their old home and gone to Queenstown, and the fairies had followed them. Cork and Queenstown had rather alarmed the fairies. They did not like the look of a city. It looked cold and stony and uncomfortable. It did not look like a good place to dance out of doors at night. They almost wished that they had stayed at home and let the O"Briens and the Sullivans go where they liked without them. Some of them even wanted to go back, but Naggeneen laughed at them, and fairies can stand being laughed at even less than human beings. But they all hoped that when the O"Briens and the Sullivans got wherever they were going, it would not prove to be in a city.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='350'>Then the O"Briens and the Sullivans went on board a ship and were stowed away in a place forward, with many other people, which the fairies did not think roomy or airy or pleasant in any way. But they were not obliged to stay in it. They found better places on the ship. Nobody could see them, so they went where they liked. They went out on the bow, where the lookout stood, and watched with him for sails and for tiny puffs of smoke by day and for little glimmers of light by night. They ran about the bridge and swarmed up the rigging. They even danced on the deck, as if they were in a field at home; and the deck was dewy at night, just like the field. They fluttered and whirled in circles around the red light on the one side of the ship and the green light on the other side, and they reminded them of the rubies and the emeralds that had helped to light their own rath.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='351'>One day they saw swimming in the water beside the ship an ugly creature, like a man, with a red nose, tangled green hair, green teeth, and fingers with webs between them, like a duck"s foot.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='360'>"I can"t tell you that," the merrow answered. "We"ve never been far on the land. Deep down under the sea it"s the same way it is under the sea about Ireland. There"s the land at the bottom, with the sand all fine and firm, like a floor, and there"s the water above, like a green sky, and there are the shells and the sea-flowers, and there are the weeds that wave around you and over you, like red and green and purple curtains to your house, and it"s all as cool and as neat as any of the sea-places around Ireland. And if you like to go up to get the warmth of the sun or the light of the stars, there"s white sand where you can lie at your ease, and there"s great rocks where you can sit and look out over the sea and get the fresh breeze.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='361'>And after a week of voyaging through the sea--after going on and on for so long and so far that both fairies and mortals began to think that they must soon fall over the edge of the earth--the ship suddenly stood up straight, instead of rolling and pitching about, and a little later they saw the giant woman before them, holding up her torch, and beyond her they saw the city. And then it was only a bit of a while longer till they came close to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bit;while' adjectives='' verbs='be;come' valence='5.46' arousal='4.25' dominance='5.42142857143'>the city</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='362'>"Look at it!" cried the King to all the fairies, who were crowded at the bow; "it"s like the country, after all! Look at all the grass and the trees! But it has an iron chain all around it. I don"t like the look of that." All fairies hate iron. They more than hate it; they simply cannot endure it. To touch any iron at all would hurt a fairy more than it would hurt you to touch it when it was red hot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='363'>"But it"s only a small place, anyway," said Naggeneen. "Look at the houses beyond there! There was nothing like them in Cork! And do you mind them strings of coaches, running along up in the air?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>The fairies all followed the O"Briens and the Sullivans. They were resolved not to lose sight of their only friends, in a land like this. They found that the O"Briens and the Sullivans were quickly taken to a big round house, in the very bit of a place like the country that they had first seen. The fairies did not like the inside of the big round house, so the King left a few to watch the O"Briens and the Sullivans, and to bring word if they made any important move, and the rest went out and found pleasanter places on the grass and under the trees. They had managed to get into the Battery Park without touching any of the horrible iron chains that were around it. They would have been a very sorry-looking company, if anybody could have seen them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>"I don"t like it at all," the King said, "and nothing would please me better than to be at home again. If they"re going to live in that big round house, I dunno what we"ll do. We want to be near to them, and yet this is no place for us. We could stand it a little while, maybe. The grass is fine and smooth for dancing, but these lights, like suns, that they have all around on the tops of the poles, are terrible. Do they want no night at all here? And then what a noise there is! It"s nothing but rattle and roar all day, and then the boats do be screeching around all night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='367'>"Have no fear," said the Queen. "The O"Briens would never live in a place like this. They"ll soon be out of it, and then we"ll follow them and find a better place near where they go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='368'>It proved that the Queen was right. Before long there came an alarm from those who had been left to watch, that the O"Briens and the Sullivans were coming out. In a moment more they came, and the whole tribe followed them. Old Mrs. O"Brien, who never forgot anything that was worth remembering, had not forgotten to write to some old friends who had come to America years before, that she and her son and his wife and their neighbors were coming. These old friends had found tenements for them, and soon they were in new homes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='369'>The fairies followed them, filled with more and more wonder. For miles they followed, and then for more miles. It was not that the distance troubled them. They could have gone a hundred times as far without thinking of being tired. But they could scarcely believe their eyes when they saw these never-ending stone roads and these never-ending rows of stone and brick houses, all built so that they touched one another. They could not understand how people could live so close together, nor why they should want to do it, if they could. Perhaps you have never thought of it, but it is really true that the ways of mortals are just as wonderful to fairies as the ways of fairies are to mortals.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='370'>Indeed, the place where they found themselves at last was not a pleasant one for fairies. It was two places, in fact, but they were so much alike that there was nothing to choose between them. A tenement had been found for the O"Briens, up many flights of stairs, in a house with many other tenements. There was barely enough room in it for them to live, though it was better, in that respect, than their old cabin in Ireland. The stairs and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='street;stair' adjectives='clean' verbs='be;lead' valence='5.94777777778' arousal='3.70444444444' dominance='5.56666666667'>the passage</entity> were far from clean, and they led down to a street that was just as far from clean.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='371'>It was hard all over with square stones, which had sunk, in places, and made hollows, which were filled with muddy water. Lean cats scuttled about here and there, and ran away, if anybody came near them, as if they expected to have stones thrown at them, and then, when the danger seemed past, they rummaged in the ash-barrels for scraps of meat or fish or bread. The people who lived in the houses sat on the doorsteps and on the curb-stones, and chattered and laughed and quarrelled and slept. The sun shone into the street, but it could not shine between the houses. A breeze blew up from the East River, which was not far away, but the air was none too fresh, for all that. The place that had been found for the Sullivans was in another street, not far away. It was much the same, as I have said, but it was even smaller, for there were only two of the Sullivans, and they could get on with less space.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='372'>The fairies were fairly terrified at all this. And was it any wonder? The poor little Good People! They had been used to a beautiful, bright hall, to green, fresh grass to dance on in the quiet, misty moonlight, and to cool shade for the day. What could they do in such a place as this? They remembered how <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='place;fit;ireland' adjectives='' verbs='do;remember;be;live;know;have;go;tell' valence='6.10642857143' arousal='3.90714285714' dominance='5.83071428571'>the King</entity> of All Ireland had told them that they did not know whether the place where they were going was a place fit for them to live in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='373'>The first thing that the King did was to send some of the fairies in all directions to see if they could spy out any place where the whole tribe could live in a decent and comfortable manner. The street, he was sure, would never do. Of course, if the Fairy King wanted a rock or a hill to open and let him into it, it would open, and he could live in it, if he chose, just as he used to in his own old rath. And no mortal who might happen to be about would know that anything unusual was happening. And just so the street would open for him, if he wanted it to. But before he had decided to try it he saw a place where some men had opened it, and that was quite enough for him. If you have ever seen a <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='use;street' adjectives='' verbs='be;try;see;know;have;open;tell' valence='6.04214285714' arousal='3.965' dominance='5.58428571429'>New York</entity> street opened, you know what it was like; if you have not, it is of no use to try to tell you.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='374'>But the messengers whom the King had sent in all directions were scarcely gone when those who had started toward the west were back with joyful news. "We have found a beautiful place," they said. "It"s only a bit of a way from here, and if we live there we"ll not be far from the O"Briens. Ye never saw grass smoother in your life, though it"s not quite so green, maybe, as it is at home. And then there"s tall trees of all kinds, and there"s bushes that"ll have flowers on them, belike, in the right time of the year. And there"s smooth roads and walks, and there"s hills and great rocks, that we could live inside of as easy as in a rath itself. It"s a much quieter place than here, too, and the air is better, though it"s so near. It"s not wide toward the west, but off to the south it reaches as far as we can see, like a forest."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='375'>The King left a guard to watch, lest the O"Briens should like the place as little as himself and should leave it and be lost, and then he hurried with the rest to see the new country that had been discovered. If you know New York very well indeed, you have guessed already that it was the north end of Central Park which the fairies had found. But you may know <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='end;people' adjectives='many;good;north;prettier;south' verbs='do;live;know;be' valence='6.25' arousal='3.76166666667' dominance='5.56166666667'>New York</entity> pretty well and not know, as a good many people who live in it do not, that there is any north end to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='end;people' adjectives='many;good;north;prettier;south' verbs='do;live;know;be' valence='6.25' arousal='3.76166666667' dominance='5.56166666667'>Central Park</entity>, still less that it is far prettier than the south end.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='376'>After all the distressing streets and houses that he had seen, the King was delighted with it. He found a big rock, which was the base of a hill, and at the top of it stood a queer little square stone house. Back in this hill, he declared, behind the rock and under the stone house, would be as pleasant a place to live as ever the rath was. He made the rock open, and he and all the fairies with him went in, although the policemen and the men and women in carriages and on horses and on bicycles and on foot who were all about, did not see that the rock looked at all different.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='377'>"A fine place for us it will make," said the King; "we couldn"t be asking for a better. Get to work now, all of you. Hollow out the inside of the hill, only leave pillars to hold up the roof, and go and find gold for the floor and silver for the walls, and you can have every other pillar gold and every other one silver, after you get the rest done, and take down the rock that you left. And then find diamonds and rubies and emeralds to light it with."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='378'>No, I am not going to explain to you how the fairies did all this. I shall not tell you how they got the rock out nor what they did with it after they got it out. I will tell you all that there is any need of your knowing about it, and that is that in a very short time it was all done; that the new fairy palace was as much larger and finer and better than any fairy palace in Ireland ever was as we Americans intend that everything here shall be larger and finer and better than anything anywhere else. And it was all done before the most of the messengers who had been sent in other directions got back to tell what they had found.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='379'>These fairies went straight to where the O"Briens lived, and there the fairies who had been left on guard told them where to find <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='duty;somebody;o;guard;place;fairy' adjectives='' verbs='be;tire;wish;say;send;find;leave;ask;live;take;have;go;tell' valence='5.93714285714' arousal='4.05142857143' dominance='5.64666666667'>the King</entity>, and asked them to say to him that they were tired of their duty and they wished that he could send somebody else to take their places.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='380'>The fairies were not much surprised when they found the King and all the tribe settled in a new palace, as comfortably as if they had never moved.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='384'>Another fairy said: "I went farther to the west than this, but not much farther till I came to a great river.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>Then came another fairy, who had been to the north, and he said: "It beats everything, the lovely country I"ve seen. Never a better did I see anywhere. Hills and woods and mountains, and the trees all yellow and red and green and brown. I went up the big river on this side for a long way, and then I saw great mountains on the other side. So beautiful they looked, I wanted to go to them, only, sure, I couldn"t cross the river. So I went round the head of it and came down back to the mountains. And there I found that they were full of fairies already. But they seemed to be Dutch, and it"s little English they could talk, let alone Irish. Still we got along, and they gave me some mighty fine drink that they had. And they said that we could come there, the whole tribe, and welcome kindly, and I"ld say it was a good place to go, only it"s farther off than this from them we want to be near."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>"We"ll stay where we are," said the King. "It"s as well that we know what"s all around us, but here we"ll be more to ourselves, as many people as there are, for I"m thinkin" there"s no fairies but us here."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='388'>Then slowly out of the crowd of fairies one came forward and said: "Your Majesty, could I be saying something that"s breakin" my heart?

But oh, Your Majesty, they"re doing things as good as we can do, or better. You wouldn"t believe what the mortals in this country do, if you wasn"t after seein" it.

You saw for yourself that they had no horses, and the coach in front that pulls them is all made of iron, and men ride in them, as if it was no harm at all to touch iron. And that"s not all. There are other coaches that go in the streets without horses. They have no iron coach in front to pull them. They go in different ways. Sometimes there"s an iron rope, that"s all the time moving and moving along under the street, and there"s a gripping iron under the coach that takes hold on it, and so it"s pulled along. And sometimes there"s only a little string--not iron, I think, but some other metal--and something just reaches down from the coach and touches it, and that makes it go. I dunno how it is, but it makes it go. And sometimes there"s fire comes out of it."</paragraph>

I have been about the city, too, and I went into some of the houses. I saw a man talking to a little box on the wall. I came close and I heard that the box was talking to him too. I thought there was a fairy inside it, but I looked inside, and there was nothing there but iron and strange works that I couldn"t understand. There were little strings of copper coming out of the box, and then a long string of iron, that led away over the tops of the houses."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='394'>The fairy stopped and shivered as he thought of the horrible string of iron. Then he went on: "I followed it and it came into another house, where there was so much iron that I couldn"t stay there. But the strings of iron came out of this house and led in all directions. I followed them and I listened everywhere and I found what they were for, though how they do it all I dunno. And it"s this way: Anywhere that there"s a box you can talk to them that"s in the house where all the iron strings go. And if they like to help you, you can talk to anybody else where there"s a box. It may be a mile off or it may be a dozen miles off. Many a time those in the house where all the strings are will not help them that wants to talk, but when they will, it"s easy. Yes, Your Majesty, one man talks to another ten miles off, as if he was standing by his side."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='395'>"Your Majesty," said another fairy, "you saw yourself the bright lights that were at the place where the grass was, that we came to first, and you"ve seen thousands more of them since. Do you know that they"re not candles, and they"re not lamps, and that there"s no fire to them at all? There"s strings of something, whatever it is, from one of them to another, and the light goes through that, whatever it is."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='396'>"There"s another thing that they do with strings like that," said still another fairy. "I saw men doing it not far from here. They made a hole in a rock and they put one end of a string in it. Then where the other end was, a man pushed a thing like a sort of handle, and the rock was all burst open, and nobody had touched it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='397'>And another fairy said: "Your Majesty, there are boats all the time going across the rivers--across the running water. Of course we always knew that mortals could cross running water, but these boats go without sails or oars, like the ship that we came here on. To be sure I couldn"t go on one, because it was across running water, but I went near one, when it was at the shore, and it was all full of iron, and I got the most awful pains from being near it. It was as bad, almost, as I felt coming here, when I"ld get too near the iron sides of the ship."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>"And a strange thing it was that I saw too," said another fairy. "I saw people looking into little boxes of wood, so I looked in too. And in one I saw a woman dancing, and in another there were horses running, and in another I saw two men fighting. And it was not a real woman or real horses or real men, but only pictures that moved and did the things that real people and horses would do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='399'>The King listened to all this and then he sat and thought. "What is there in it that I can"t do?" he asked. "Do you not all know of the coaches in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='coachman;horse;coach;head' adjectives='' verbs='do;draw;drive;know;be' valence='5.98' arousal='3.759' dominance='5.489'>Ireland</entity> that are drawn by horses without heads and driven by coachmen without heads?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='400'>All the fairies looked at one another and nodded and said, "Yes, yes, we know."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='401'>But Naggeneen came forward and stood before the throne. Nobody had noticed that he had been listening or that he was there. "And what if those coaches were in Ireland?" he said. "They had horses, though the horses had no heads. Can you make iron coaches go without any horses at all?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='402'>The King was trying to talk boldly, but he stammered and grew pale at the very thought of having anything to do with an iron coach, and he did not answer. He went on instead: "Can I not send any one of you on a message, as fast as the wind?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='405'>"That"s not the question," said the cruel Naggeneen; "can you do it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='406'>"I never tried," said the King. "And can I not light up this palace," he went on, "or any other palace, with diamonds? Can I not make a light so that a man who looks behind him when he is going on a journey or at work in the fields will think his house is on fire and run back?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='407'>"And when he has run back," said Naggeneen, "will he find that his house is on fire? You know that he will not. It"s only glamour, and he"ll soon be laughing at you. Oh, we can catch a few firebugs in spiders" webs and deceive a boy or a girl that"s passing, and maybe make them turn aside and dance with us, but can you put real lights all over the country for miles--lights that will burn on and on and show real things? Our lights are lies themselves and they can no more than lead a silly mortal astray for a time; their lights tell the truth. What else can you do?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='408'>The King had lost the most of his boldness. "They say," he said, "that men can burst open the rock. Can I not do that as well?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='409'>"You can open this rock for us to pass through," said Naggeneen; "and what then? A man can see it open for a moment, if you choose to let him, and the next minute it"s all as one as if you had never touched it. And the man thinks that"s wonderful, for he doesn"t know that you can do it no other way. All glamour again!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='415'>The King had no more courage left in him than if he had been talking to the King of All Ireland instead of to Naggeneen. "Naggeneen," he cried, "come back and tell us something better nor all this. It"s not pleasant you are in your talk, and it"s often you make me angry with you, but after all you"re cleverer than any of us. Tell us what to do. It was not like this where we lived before.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='417'>"But what are we to do," the King went on, "to show them that we"re their masters? Sure we"re cleverer than them all out, and we can prove it in some way."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='418'>"King," said Naggeneen, speaking as boldly as if he were himself a greater king, "you can never prove that you"re cleverer than men, for you"re not cleverer. It was a poor, wasted, weak, and sorrowful country that we came from, and it"s a rich, new, strong, and happy country that we"ve come to. There"s the differ. Clever you are, maybe, and your people, too, and I may be clever in my own way, and we may play our little tricks on mortals, as I did on the Sullivans, if they"re as stupid as them. But mortals can be cleverer than we ever can when they are clever, and they can beat us every time if they know how. And do you know why? Because they have what we have not--because they have souls. I heard a school-master say once that the word "mortal" was made from a word that meant death. And they call mortals that, I"m thinkin", because they never die. But you will die, King, and all your people, and I. We live on and on for thousands of years, and men come and change and pass away, but at the last day we shall be gone, as a bit of cloud up in the sky is gone when the sun shines on it. That"s why men will always be greater and finer and stronger than us, with all our magic."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='419'>The fairies were all so terrified that they shrank away from Naggeneen and clung together and shook, in their fright, for this fear of living for a long time and then going out like a candle is their greatest fear. There was not a bit of color left in the King"s face now. It was almost with a sob that he spoke again, and there was a kind of beseeching in his tone as he said: "Naggeneen, don"t talk like that to us! We don"t know it! It may be so, but we don"t know it! We"ve tried many a time to find out, but no one that knew would ever tell us! We may have souls! We don"t know that we"ve not! We may be saved!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='420'>"You do know it!" Naggeneen cried. "Why will you try to deceive yourselves? You"ve no soul and I"ve no soul, and there"s no way that we can have them. If there"d been any way, I"ld have had one long ago. But we"ll never have them, and mortals will always outwit us, if they half know how. Shall I tell you how one of them outwitted me--a big, lazy, stupid gommoch, with not enough brains to keep his neck safe?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='421'>The fairies were far past caring whether they heard a story or not, but they listened as Naggeneen went on. "I"m after tellin" you," he said, "that if there was any way that one of us could be gettin" a soul, I"ld have had one long ago. This was the way I tried it, and a silly mortal outwitted me. Guleesh na Guss Dhu was the name that was on him. I had heard--and I believed it--that if I could get a mortal woman married to me--a woman with a soul--that I would get a soul, too, that way. Well, I was never over-modest in my tastes, you know, and I thought that the daughter of the King of France was about right for me. A beautiful girl she was, with the rose and the lily fighting in her cheeks, and she was eighteen years old. But sure I thought that the differ of a few thousand years in our ages would be nothing to me, and I hoped it would be nothing to her either.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='422'>"I was living in a rath and wearing a green jacket then. All the others in the rath promised that they"ld help me. The King"s daughter was to be married to the son of the King of another country on November Eve; and you know there"s no better time to steal a girl than the night she"s to be married, and November Eve is a fine time, too, so it was settled that we"ld go over to France and steal her on that night. But, as you know, we needed a mortal to help us. How else could we be bringin" her across from France? If we could put her on a horse behind a man, she"ld have flesh and blood to take a grip of, but if she was put up behind one of us, she might as well try to hold to a puff of smoke. You know that.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='423'>"We got ready, making sure that we"ld find some fool of a mortal ready for us when the time came, and sure enough, when we"d been out for a little look at the country before starting, and were coming back, there sat this same Guleesh na Guss Dhu, between the rath and the gable of his father"s house, that was near by, staring up at the moon, like he"d never seen one before. There was no need to try to catch him or to bring him with us, or the likes of that. All we had to do was to let him hear us as we passed and let him see the door of the rath open, and in he came of himself to see what it was all about. We hadn"t let him see ourselves yet, but he heard us all calling: "My horse and bridle and saddle! My horse and bridle and saddle!" and what did he do but call out after us: "My horse and bridle and saddle!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>"There was the beam of a plough lying near, and I changed it into a horse for him, and pleased he was when he saw it standing forninst him, with its bridle of gold and saddle of silver and all.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='425'>"Then I said to him: "Are you coming with us to-night, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='to-night' verbs='be;say;come' valence='5.6825' arousal='4.1075' dominance='5.83'>Guleesh</entity>?"</paragraph>

"Oh, but she was the beauty of the world!" he went on, speaking so low that the fairies could scarcely hear him. "There was the lily and the rose in her cheeks, and her arms like snow, and her hair like soft gold. Not like the gold that you dig out of the ground for your palace, but gold with life in it.

So they led the Prince and the Princess up toward the altar, and she with the rose all gone out of her cheeks and only the lily left. But when they were not more than four yards from the altar I put out my foot before the Princess, and she fell, and then, with a word of a charm, I made her invisible to all but Guleesh and ourselves. Then I made a sign to Guleesh, and he took up the Princess and ran with her out of the hall, and all the rest of us after them. "My horse and bridle and saddle!" says every one of us, and the same says Guleesh. He lifted the Princess up behind him on his horse and we were away again. We overtook the wind that was before us, and the wind that was behind us did not overtake us till we came to the sea. "Hie over cap!" cried every one of us, and "Hie over cap!" cried <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='moment' adjectives='' verbs='be;cry' valence='5.125' arousal='4.4825' dominance='4.765'>Guleesh</entity>, and in a moment we were in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='moment' adjectives='' verbs='be;cry' valence='5.125' arousal='4.4825' dominance='4.765'>Ireland</entity> again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='448'>"Another minute and we were close to our own rath, and it was then that all the work of the night was lost. For then what did the fool Guleesh do but take the Princess in his arms and leap down off his horse, and he cried: "I call you to myself, in the name of--" Oh, now, you little cowards, you"ve no call to shrink away like that and to try to be hiding in the dark corners! You know I can"t say the name that he said. But he said it, and then the enchantment was all gone, and he saw that the horse he"d been riding was nothing but the beam of a plough and that the horse that each of the others had was only an old broom, or maybe a rag weed, or the like of that.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='449'>"And you know that there was no getting the Princess away from him after the words that he said. But I came close to her and struck her on the mouth. "Now, Guleesh," said I, "you may keep her if you will, but she"ll be dumb forever." And with that we all disappeared from them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='450'>"But you may be sure I watched them. They stood there together and Guleesh talked to her and tried to make her talk back, but it was of no use at all, and he soon found that she was dumb completely. Then he stood thinking what would he do with her, and at last he took her by the hand and started toward the priest"s house. It was getting near day now, and the priest was up by the time they came to the door, and he opened it himself. And when he saw Guleesh and the girl, sure he thought they were come to be married, and he said: "Ah, Guleesh, isn"t it the nice boy ye are, that ye can"t wait till a decent hour to be married, but ye must be comin" to me this early? And don"t ye know I can"t marry ye lawfully anyway, and I put out of my place?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='451'>"Then says Guleesh: "Sure, father, you can marry me or anybody else you like, for you have your place back again, and here"s the Pope"s bull for that same. But it"s not that I come for, but to ask you to give shelter to this young lady, the daughter of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shelter;daughter;lady' adjectives='young' verbs='ask;s;come;give' valence='6.177' arousal='4.246' dominance='5.612'>the King</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shelter;daughter;lady' adjectives='young' verbs='ask;s;come;give' valence='6.177' arousal='4.246' dominance='5.612'>France</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='452'>[Illustration: "HERE"S THE POPE"S BULL FOR THAT SAME."]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='453'>"And with that he takes the Pope"s bull out of his pocket and gives it to the priest, and the priest looked at the writing and the seal and saw that there was no doubt but it was right. And so he made Guleesh and the Princess come in and sit down, while Guleesh told him the whole story, and not a word of it would he have believed only there was the Pope"s bull that he couldn"t deny, and so at long last he had to believe all that Guleesh told him. And the end of it was that the Princess stayed at the priest"s house, for they didn"t know how to send her back to her father"s palace, and they had no money, and she couldn"t speak to help them. And the priest gave out that she was the daughter of his brother, that lived in another county, and that she was making him a visit. And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;d;rath' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;say;sleep' valence='6.39857142857' arousal='4.09571428571' dominance='5.71428571429'>Guleesh</entity> went home and said how he"d been sleeping beside the rath all night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='454'>Naggeneen paused in his story, while all the fairies drew quietly closer to him. "Do you see," he said, "how I was tricked by a fool of a mortal? Oh, she was the beauty of the world, and he took her from me with a word, as easily as you"ld steal the butter out of a churn. And that was not all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='455'>"I said to myself that I was not done with my revenge on them yet. She could not speak and it was a sore punishment on the both of them. Yet she stayed on at the priest"s house. The priest wrote letters to her father, as I heard, and gave them to merchants who were travelling, but none of them ever reached him. And Guleesh got mighty serious about his soul all at once, so that he had to be at the priest"s house every day, and every day he saw the Princess. She could never talk to him, but she learned to make signs that he could understand. And so it went on for a year.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='456'>"And then, when it was November Eve again, and we had been out of the rath and were all coming into it again in a great crowd, there sat Guleesh, the same as before. He couldn"t see us, but he must have heard us, for you could see that he was listening with all his ears. And I thought now was the fine time to be having the laugh on him. By that time everybody was shouting: "My horse and bridle and saddle! My horse and bridle and saddle!" and Guleesh shouted as before: "My horse and bridle and saddle! My horse and bridle and saddle!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='457'>""Now is my chance to be even with him," thought I, and I said: "Ah, Guleesh, my boy, is that yourself that"s to the fore again? You"ll get no horse to-night and you"ll play no more tricks on us. How are you getting on with your Princess? Does she talk to you much? Or do you just like to sit and look at her?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='458'>"And when I said that, he looked so pale and so sad that I almost screamed with joy, and I couldn"t keep myself from whispering to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='omadhaun;door;d;joy;speech;t;herb;close;isn' adjectives='own;back;next;stupid;sad;pale' verbs='be;couldn;give;whisper;s;keep;say;know;grow;scream;boil;look' valence='5.4164516129' arousal='4.28935483871' dominance='5.37677419355'>the man</entity> that was next to me: "And isn"t he the stupid omadhaun, not to know that there"s an herb growing close to his own door that would give her back her speech if he"d only boil it and give it to her?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='459'>""It"s the stupid omadhaun he is," said the other man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>"Oh, and it was me that was the omadhaun, to be saying it at all. Oh, why couldn"t I hold my jaw? But it was like some spell was on me, and I had to say it. I had to say it! I couldn"t have kept it back if I"d tried. And he heard every word!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='461'>"It"s little more there is to tell. The next morning, as soon as there was light, there was Guleesh searching for any herb that was strange to him around the door. And it was not long till he found it. Then he boiled it, and he drank some of it himself, to see whether it might be poison, and it put him into a deep sleep. And when he woke he went to the priest"s house and told the whole story and gave the Princess some of the drink, and then she went to sleep and did not wake till the next day. And when she woke she had her speech back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='462'>"Ah, well, by this time they was both in love with each other, and all that I did for myself or against them had only helped them. But it was not long before the Princess was saying that she must be off to her father, and nothing that the priest and Guleesh could do would make her stay. So the priest took the jewels that she had on her when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='money;priest;jewel;way' adjectives='' verbs='sell;give;pay;bring;take;have' valence='5.90384615385' arousal='4.20692307692' dominance='5.59230769231'>Guleesh</entity> first brought her, and he sold them and gave her the money, and she took it and paid her way back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='money;priest;jewel;way' adjectives='' verbs='sell;give;pay;bring;take;have' valence='5.90384615385' arousal='4.20692307692' dominance='5.59230769231'>France</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='463'>"And after that great grief and melancholy came over Guleesh, and nothing would do him but he must start off for France to find the Princess again.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='464'>There was nothing strange in the last that Naggeneen had told--nothing more strange, I mean, than that a peasant boy should marry the daughter of the King of France--but his voice, before he had ended, was so low and so full of grief that all the other fairies kept very still to listen, and when he had told his story none of them spoke for a little while. At last <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='last' verbs='be;say' valence='6.03' arousal='4.10333333333' dominance='5.97'>the King</entity> said: "How long was all this ago, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='last' verbs='be;say' valence='6.03' arousal='4.10333333333' dominance='5.97'>Naggeneen</entity>?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='466'>"Then what is it to you now?" said the King. "Sure they"re both dead long ago, and here are you as sound as ever."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='467'>"Yes," Naggeneen cried, "as sound as ever and as sound as I"ll ever be. They"re not dead. They had souls. They"re alive now, and when what they call "the Last Day" comes, they"ll live still, forever. And then I shall go out, like a shadow when the light falls on it. There"s no more of me that can last than a shadow. And you will go out that way, too, and all of us. It was not her that I wanted so much. It was the soul that I thought I"ld get, and her married to me. That was it. And a stupid mortal had tricked me twice. It was then I left the rath. It was then I could bear to look at nobody, man or fairy. Then I put on the red jacket and went by myself. After a time I was a lepracaun, and a cluricaun, and nothing at all, as it suited me, and sometimes I lived in a rath with others, as I have in yours, and other times I went by myself. But I never forgot how I was tricked by a mortal, and I"ve never forgot how I missed getting a soul when I was near to it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='468'>"You"ve never liked me; you"ve always thought me sour and harsh and cruel. Do you see why now? Since that time I"ve always hated all men, because of the one that tricked me; and I"ve always hated all women, because of the one I lost; and I"ve always hated all fairies, because they are all as weak and helpless and pitiful as myself. I hate myself and I hate all of you, because there"s no good for any of us in all the world forever."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='469'>"Naggeneen," said the King, "we"ve never been too fond of you, it"s true, but maybe we"ld have liked you better if you"d told us this before.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='470'>"What"ll you do?" Naggeneen answered; "there"s nothing you can do. They"ll outwit you, whatever you do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='471'>"But there must be some way. Tell us what to do, Naggeneen," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='naggeneen' adjectives='' verbs='do;tell;plead' valence='4.985' arousal='4.075' dominance='5.06'>the King</entity> pleaded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='472'>"I"ll tell you what to do, then," said Naggeneen; "send out your people and let them learn the ways of men. Let them learn to make the iron coaches that go up in the air; let them learn to make the coaches that go on the ground, with the iron ropes; let them learn to talk miles away through iron strings; let them learn to make the bright lights that you see; let them learn to open the rock so that it will not close again; let them learn to cross running water in boats full of iron; let them learn to handle iron and do what they like with it, as if it were only gold, and then, maybe, they"ll be able to do all the things that men do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='473'>The fairies were simply cowering away from the King and Naggeneen and shivering and squealing with fright at the talk of handling iron and crossing running water. "Ah, Naggeneen," said the King, "you know we can"t do all that. Tell us what we"ll do at all."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='474'>"There"s nothing that you can do," said Naggeneen. "There"s only one thing I know you can try, and I think that"ll do no good either."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='475'>"But what is it?" said the King. "We"ll try it, anyway."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='476'>"It"s not the time to try it yet," Naggeneen answered. "When the time comes I"ll tell you."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='478'>And Naggeneen took the fiddle and played. But there was no merriment in it now.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='482'>THE TIME FOR NAGGENEEN"S PLAN</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='483'>Little happened that needs to be told in the next few months, either to the fairies or to the human people. John O"Brien and Peter Sullivan were not long in finding work to do, and they were paid for it, and the two families got on better than they had in Ireland. The O"Briens got on better than the Sullivans. John was a better workman than Peter. Peter could do the work that was set before him in the way that he was told. But John could do better than that. He could see for himself how the work ought to be done, and he saw that if he did it well he might get better work to do. In Ireland, work as he would, he could no more than live, and so he had come to care little what he did or how he did it. But it was different here. The men who employed him saw that he was not a common workman, and soon they gave him better than the common work and more than the common pay.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='484'>But Peter was a common workman. Then, too, John"s mother knew how to care for the house better than Ellen did, and because of that, too, the O"Briens did better. Every day, just as she used to do in Ireland, Mrs. O"Brien left something to eat and drink outside the house for the Good People. She said that she did not know whether there were any Good People here, but if there were they must be well treated. And when she found that what she left for them was taken, she said that she knew that there were Good People here. Of course she did not know that they were the same ones who had lived near them in Ireland. She put the milk and the water and the bread, or whatever she had for them, on the fire-escape, at the back of the rooms where they lived. And first she always laid down a little piece of carpet to put the dishes on, so that the fairies could come and get the food without touching the iron, for she knew that they could never do that. There was only one thing that did not go well with the O"Briens. Kitty"s health did not come back to her, as they had hoped that it would. She did not need to do any work now, though she would do some, and the rest was good for her, but she was still pale and still weak.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='485'>Though the Sullivans did not find their fortunes so much improved in the new country as the O"Briens did, yet they felt that they had gained, too, and in one way especially. For the King of the fairies had forbidden Naggeneen to trouble them any more. Naggeneen asked what for at all he had come over all the sea, if he was not to trouble the Sullivans. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;use;cleverness;time' adjectives='ready;enough' verbs='do;obey;be;tell;have;think;help' valence='5.99590909091' arousal='3.83045454545' dominance='5.70227272727'>The King</entity> was always ready enough to have <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;use;cleverness;time' adjectives='ready;enough' verbs='do;obey;be;tell;have;think;help' valence='5.99590909091' arousal='3.83045454545' dominance='5.70227272727'>Naggeneen</entity>"s help, when he thought that his cleverness would be of use; but there were times when he would be obeyed, and this was one of them, so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;use;cleverness;time' adjectives='ready;enough' verbs='do;obey;be;tell;have;think;help' valence='5.99590909091' arousal='3.83045454545' dominance='5.70227272727'>Naggeneen</entity> had to do as he was told.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='486'>The King tried all the things that Naggeneen had told him to do, to make his people learn all the wonderful magic that the human people knew so well. Naggeneen had told him at first that it would all be of no use, and so the King found it. The fairies were sent out to watch the men, to see all that they did, and to learn how to do it. It was all in vain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='487'>The King often asked Naggeneen what was the one other way that he had said they might try. Naggeneen would never tell. When the time came to try it, he said, he would tell what it was, but it would be of no more use than the rest that they had done. Naggeneen laughed at all the others when they came home baffled and out of sorts. "You"ll never do the things that men do," he said, "any more than they"ll ever do the things that you do. And their wonders are more and better than yours."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='488'>After a time they ceased to try to learn any more. They began to live much as they had lived in Ireland. They had found a green place where they could dance, near the palace, but it was winter now, and the snow was over everything much of the time. They went to the O"Briens every day for the food that was left outside the window for them, and, for the most part, they spent the rest of the time in the palace. Often Naggeneen played the fiddle or the pipes for them. Then they forgot that it was his fault that they had ever come here, but when he stopped playing they remembered it and hated him again. And Naggeneen laughed at them. He had a strange laugh, without a bit of merriment or good-humor in it. There was something sad in his laugh and something sour, but nothing that it was pleasant to hear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='489'>Then the spring began to come. The grass was looking a bit green and the air was warmer. They could dance on the grass now, whenever they liked. They had given up trying to learn the ways of men, and they were beginning to feel as if they had always lived here. Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plan;time' adjectives='good' verbs='be;s;try;say;stand;want;come' valence='6.00642857143' arousal='3.855' dominance='5.70285714286'>Naggeneen</entity> came one evening and stood before <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plan;time' adjectives='good' verbs='be;s;try;say;stand;want;come' valence='6.00642857143' arousal='3.855' dominance='5.70285714286'>the King</entity> and said: "It is the time now to try my plan, if you want to try it, but it"s no good."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='490'>"What"s the plan, then, at all?" <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.975' arousal='3.965' dominance='5.91'>the King</entity> asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='491'>"You know well," said Naggeneen, "that your people can find out nothing by going out and watching what men do. Now, what you want is to get a human child here, or maybe two of them, and keep them and let them grow up with you here, and then send them out to learn everything that men do, and come back and teach it to your people. Then you"ll learn all these things that men do, and you can do the like."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='492'>"Ah, Naggeneen," said the King, "it"s yourself was always the clever boy. We"ll do that same."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='493'>"You will so," Naggeneen replied, "and no good will it ever do you. I"ve told you before and I tell you again, you"ll never do the things that men do. But it"s crazy you are to try all ways, and I have to be telling you the ways to try. Go on and do it, if it divarts you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='494'>"And where"ll we get the human child at all?" the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='6.235' arousal='4.265' dominance='6.165'>Queen</entity> asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='495'>"Sure then," said Naggeneen, "and haven"t you heard the news? Why, there"s a baby at the Sullivans" since this morning, and one at the O"Briens" since this afternoon. The one at the Sullivans" is a boy and the one at the O"Briens" is a girl. Go and get them and leave two of your own people in their places. You know how to do that; it"s nothing new to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='496'>"Take a child from the O"Briens!" the Queen cried. "From them that"s always been so good to us and always given us the bit and sup, when they scarcely had it themselves? I"d never do such a thing."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='497'>"But you"ld be leaving one of your own people in the place of it," Naggeneen answered, "and they"ld never know the differ. Or if they did, it would be no matter. A woman makes a great hullabaloo when her child looks sick and she thinks it"s dying on her, but she doesn"t care at all after a little. And then, it doesn"t die, and she thinks it"s her own child all the time, and there"s no harm done. And His Majesty here thinks it"s going to do a power of good for all of you. It"s not, but he thinks it is."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='498'>"We"ll never take a child from the O"Briens if I can help it," the Queen said. "From the Sullivans I don"t care, but not from the O"Briens."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='499'>"We"ll have to do it," said the King. "I don"t like to hurt the O"Briens myself, but it"s for the good of us all, and it"s our only chance. These mortals are getting ahead of us that far, and they"ll be doing something next that will exterminate us entirely. We"ll send and get both the children."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='500'>The Queen urged again that the O"Briens had always been good to the Good People and must not be harmed, but the King had his mind set on Naggeneen"s plan and he would hear of nothing else. It was settled and it could not be changed. They must have both children. They should live among the fairies till they were old enough to be sent out to learn the ways of men. And they should always come back and teach the fairies the ways of men that they had learned.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='501'>"And it"s to-night we"d better be doing it, if we"re to do it at all," said the King. "Now, who"ll be the ones to go and be put in the place of the children?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='502'>Nobody seemed to care about going to play the part of a baby with the Sullivans, or even with the O"Briens. Everybody was trying to get out of the King"s sight behind the others. "We"ld have to be lyin" still all day," one whispered, "with never a dance to rest ourselves with."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>"They might be puttin" holy water on us," said another, and all who heard him shivered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='504'>"There"ll be all sorts of unpleasantness, anyway," said a third.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='505'>"Maybe they"ld find us out," said a fourth, "and then they"ld be puttin" all sorts of horrible charms on us to be rid of us."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='512'>"We"ll not want you at all. You do tell us what to do and we do it when we like, and it"s small good ever came of it. And then, if we do want anything of you, we know where to find you, and we"ll easily come to you. It"s been done before. You was left in the place of a young man that was taken away once before, and when the tribe that you was with then wanted to talk to you they came to you, and we can do the same if we like, but I don"t think we shall like."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='513'>"That"s just it," Naggeneen cried; "did you know about that time? This time would be just like it. Do you know how they drove me off? I couldn"t help it then and I couldn"t help it again. There"s times when it seems like there"s a charm on me, and so there is, belike, and I have to do a thing that it"s bad for me to do. Do you know the whole of it, how it was that time?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='514'>"It was a man that time, as you say, and not a child. Rickard the Rake he was called, I remember, and a fine rake he was. Never a bit of work would he do, but he"ld always be at every fair or wake or the like of that. And so little good there was in him that the fairies in the rath where I was then said: "It"s an easy thing it"ll be stealing him away, and serve him right, too, and he"ll be handy for us, he"s so good a dancer."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='515'>"I was ordered to be the one to be left in his place, though I knew no good would come of it. And so one night, when he was dancing, we struck him with a dart in the hip, and he fell down where he was. And then, in all the bother and the noise that there was, it was easy to get him away and to leave me in the place of him. So they took me up and put me in bed and nursed me and did all they could think of for me, and me all the time squirming and squealing, like it was dying I was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='516'>"They gave me everything I could think of to eat, and that was not so bad, for I never lived better in my life; but it was worn out I was getting, with lying there all the time and playing sick, and never a chance to stir about or get any air or a minute to myself. And the thing I was spoiling for was a tune out of the pipes or the fiddle. Then they brought a fairy-man to look at me, and he said it was a fairy and not Rickard at all that was in it, and I couldn"t be telling you all the bad names he put on me and the things he said about me.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='517'>Just here I must stop Naggeneen in his story for a minute, to tell you that when people in Ireland speak of a "fairy-man" they do not mean a man fairy. They mean a man who knows all about fairies. The fairy-men know all that the fairies can do, and they know the charms against them and the ways to cure a sickness that the fairies have brought upon anyone, and the ways to keep them from stealing the cream from the milk and the milk from the cow. So the people have great respect for a fairy-man or a fairy-woman, and they often send to one of them for help, when they think that the fairies may have done them a mischief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='518'>"They left the pipes beside me," Naggeneen went on, "and then they went away. Oh, it was then I had the terrible time all out. Oh, may I never long for anything again as I longed to play them pipes! But I knew that they"ld be listening and watching, and if they caught me at it, I"ld have to pay for it, if they could make me. So I kept my hands off them and only groaned and took on as if the dart in my hip was killing me entirely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='519'>"Then there was one hot afternoon, and everything was still about the house, and it was the harvest time, and they all had a right to be in the fields at work. And sure I thought it was there they were. And then the wish to play the pipes came on me worse than ever before. And it was then that it was like there was a charm on me, as I was telling you. I had to do what I did. I could no more help doing it than a girl can help dancing with us, when we get her in our ring on May Eve. But first I opened the door a crack and looked out into the kitchen, to see was there anybody there, and there was nobody. But they were all in another room, as I found out after, waiting and listening. There was the fairy-man and a fairy-woman and all the people of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='people;fairy-man;neighbor;fairy-woman' adjectives='' verbs='be' valence='5.934' arousal='3.974' dominance='5.486'>the house</entity>, and some of the neighbors.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='520'>"But if I"d seen them all I dunno if I could have done other than I did, the power, whatever it was, was on me that strong. And I took the pipes and played. It was soft I played at first, and then the music got the better of me and I went on more and louder, and I played tunes and tunes. I could play as well then as I can now, and so the other fairies, that had been without me for some time, must have heard me playing, for soon I heard the rustle and the whisper and the patter of their coming, and then they gathered round me, and I had been left there lonely for so long that I kept on playing, to keep them with me.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='526'>""We"ll do the both of them things," says he, and with that they both started into the kitchen, and all the rest of the people after them. But you may believe that by that time I was not there at all. I"d had enough of their kindness and I didn"t think it was right to wait for any more of it. But I looked in at the window for a last glimpse of them, and one of the women saw me, and she screamed, and then the fairy-man made after me with the tongs, and I had to vanish completely.

And the scissors, too, they couldn"t come near, and then leaving them open they make a cross, and that keeps the child all the more from the Good People."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='573'>"And what"s wrong with the child, then?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='574'>"There"s everything wrong with the child," said Peter. "It"s not like the same child at all. Last night he was as healthy a boy as you"ld wish to see--quiet and peaceable and good-tempered and strong-looking, for his age. And now this morning he"s thin and sick-looking, and there"s black hair all over his arms, and his face is wrinkled, like he was a little old man, and he does nothing but cry and scream till you can"t bear it, and twist and squirm till you can"t hold him.

They found Ellen lying in bed, looking frightened half to death, and beside her was the baby, or the fairy, or whatever it was. It was not crying loudly now, but it was keeping up a little whining and whimpering noise that was quite as unpleasant to listen to as a good, honest cry. Its face looked thin and pinched and old; it had a little thin, wispy hair on its head where no baby of the age that this one was supposed to be has a right to have any. Its arms and hands were thin and bony. It looked weak and sick, but it was rolling and wriggling about in the liveliest way.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='588'>"I"ll not hurt the child, whatever it is," said Mrs. O"Brien, "but there are ways to tell whether it"s your own child at all or one of the Good People. If you find it"s one of them, then it"s easy to do more, but in the meantime it"s not harmed."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='589'>"I"ll not have you trying any of them things," said Ellen. "I"ll not have you saying it"s not my child, and I"ll not be thinking of such a thing myself.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='590'>"Ellen," said Mrs. O"Brien, "you don"t know what you"re talking about at all. Wait now till I tell you what was told to me when I lived in Dublin, and I think that it was not far from there that it happened. It"s about a woman that talked as you do. A sailor"s wife she was, and there was a child born to her while her husband was away at sea. She thought he"ld be home soon, and so she wanted to put off the christening of the child till he"ld be back. So she waited and waited for a long time, and her husband did not come. The neighbors told her she was doing wrong to wait so long and she ought to have the child christened before anything would happen to it. But she wouldn"t listen to them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='591'>"So it went on for a year and a half, and still the father didn"t come home. But the boy was healthy and happy, and the mother never had any trouble with him. But the trouble came. One day she"d been working in the field, and she came home, and as soon as she was in the house she heard crying from the bed where the child used to sleep. She ran to look at him, and he lay there, looking sick and thin and weak, the way your boy does, and crying that he was hungry. He was like her child and he was not like him. He"d grown so pale and bad-looking that she thought he"d had a stroke from the Good People. But she went to get him some bread and milk, and she asked her other boy, that was about seven years old, when it was and how it was that he began to be sick.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='592'>""I left him playing near the fire," the boy said, "and I was in the other room. And I heard a rushing noise, like a great flock of birds flying down the chimney, and then I heard a cry from my brother and then again the noise, like the birds were flying out at the chimney again. And then I ran in and found him there <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='see;run;find' valence='6.008' arousal='4.112' dominance='5.502'>the way</entity> you see him now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='593'>"Well, if the poor woman had never had trouble with the child before, she had nothing but trouble now. Crying and squalling it was all the time, and it nearly ate her out of house and home, and yet it seemed always sick and weak and thin. The neighbors came and they told her it was not her child at all, but one of the Good People that had been put in the place of it, and it was all her own fault for not having it christened in the right time. But not a word of it all would she listen to, and she said all the time that, whatever was wrong with it, it was her own child and she"ld hear nothing to the contrary.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='594'>"It was an out-of-the-way place where they lived, and there was no priest near, or she never could have kept it from being christened as long as she did. But at last the neighbors themselves said that if she didn"t see to it, they would. And they said to her: "It"s not your child at all that"s in it, and if you"ll have it christened you"ll see. And if you won"t take the child to the priest with us now, we"ll go to him ourselves and tell him all about it. It"s not right to keep it from him longer."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='595'>"So with that she thought it was no use and she"ld have to do as they said, and she took the child and tried to dress him, ready to take him to the priest to be christened. But the roars and the screams that he let out of him were more than anybody could bear, and at the last she said: "Oh, I can"t do it; it"s too terrible a thing for him; he won"t bear it, and how can I make him?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='596'>"The next day when she came in from her work the other boy said to her: "Mother, it was uncommon quiet he was while you was away to-day. And by and by I went in to see what was ailing him. And there he sat, looking so like an old man that I was near afraid of him. And he looked at me and he spoke as plain as an old man, and he says: "Pat," says he, "bring me a pipe, till I have a bit of a smoke. It"s tired of life I am, lying here without it.""</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='597'>"""Ah," says I, "wait till my mother gets home and I"ll tell her of this.""</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='600'>"Well, soon after that there came a letter from the father, saying that he"ld be at home now in a few days.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='601'>"Then as soon as she was off, the neighbors said: "Now is the time that we"ll be done with that imp. We"ll take him and have him christened while she"s away, and we"ll not give her the chance to put it off again because he cries."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='602'>"So they went to the house and one of the women came up to the bed and clapped a quilt over him and had him wrapped up in it before he knew what was happening to him, and away they all went down toward the brook, on the way to the priest. Well, he kicked and he struggled to get free, but the woman held him so tight it was no use. But when they came to the running water, it was then he began bellowing like a herd of bulls, and kicking and pulling so that it was all she could do to hold him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='603'>"She got her foot on the first of the stepping-stones, and it was then he began to get heavy, as if it was a stone that she was carrying. But she held hard and reached the second stone, and it seemed to her that he was nothing but a lump of lead, only still roaring and struggling; and, what with that and the rushing of the water below her, she began to get dizzy, but still she held on, and she had her foot on the stone in the middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;quilt;lead;middle;muslin;lump;water;foot;handkerchief;nothing' adjectives='hard;dizzy' verbs='be;rush;get;roar;reach;begin;struggle;have;fall;wrap;seem;hold;plump' valence='5.294375' arousal='3.99875' dominance='5.4025'>the stream</entity> when plump down he fell through the quilt that he was wrapped in, as if it had been nothing but a muslin handkerchief.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='605'>"And there he went floating down the stream, and shouting and laughing at them. For, you know, it"s not being in running water that can hurt one of the Good People, but only crossing it, and if they tried to cross it they"ld be in awful pain till they got to the middle, and then nothing could keep them from falling in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='606'>"So they were rid of him, and you know when you"re rid of a changeling the Good People must send your own child back.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='607'>"And now, Ellen," said Mrs. O"Brien, "will you let me try, in ways that I know, that can do no harm, whether this is your own child or not? And if it"s not, you"ll have your own back, as well as it was last night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='608'>"This is my own child," Ellen answered, "and it"s not by any silly tales like that that you can make me believe it isn"t.

But if that is your child, it doesn"t look to me as if it would live an hour.

Of course I am obliged to write a little something to fill in all that time, but you are not obliged to read it. That is where you have such an advantage. I think it is much better for a book to have some parts that can be skipped just as well as not, you get through it so much faster. I have often thought what a good thing it would be if somebody would write a book that we could skip the whole of. I think a good many people would like to have such a book as that.

When you get farther on, if you happen to come to something that you don"t understand, you can say: "Oh, this is probably all explained by something in that part that I skipped," and you can go right on. But if you had not skipped anything and then came to something that you did not understand, you would have to say: "There, now, I must have been reading carelessly and missed something," and you would have to go back and read the book all through again.</paragraph>

It would have been a pleasure for anybody to have the care of Kathleen. Even when she was a baby she was a perfect delight, and you know what babies are sometimes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='636'>I don"t say that Kathleen never did any of these things. I only say that she was so good that you would have to leave off every one of them or you would never catch up with her. If Kathleen had a fault, it was that she was too good. If I were going to have anything to do with her I would rather she should be a little bit worse than a single bit better. I am so glad you are skipping this part, because I shouldn"t want you to try to be a bit worse than you are just for the sake of pleasing me. And I don"t mean by all this that Kathleen was one of those children who are a bother all the time because they are so good. She may have done things that she ought not to do sometimes. I dare say she did. I know she did once. I will tell you all about that in the next chapter. She was just a dear, sweet little girl, as bright and merry and healthy as any little girl in the world ever was. And you would think so yourself, if you had known her and were not so jealous. If I should tell you that she was as pretty as she was good, I don"t suppose you would believe me. But she was, just as surely as I am writing this book and you are reading it. I mean just as surely as I am writing it. I am not sure yet whether you are reading it or not.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='637'>But Terence! Well, the less said about him the better. Still, I suppose, I shall have to say something. He did every one of the things that I have just mentioned. And it wasn"t because he didn"t know any better; he seemed to like to do them, just because he knew that they were wrong. When he was a baby he was more trouble than twins, and bad twins at that. He cried all the time, except when he was eating or sleeping, and he slept only a little of the time and ate a great deal of it. He always seemed to be just about so sick, but it never hurt his appetite and he never got any sicker. After a while <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='while;trouble;child' adjectives='poor;much;delicate;sick;cross' verbs='be;use;say;get' valence='5.35571428571' arousal='4.10071428571' dominance='4.99714285714'>Ellen</entity> got used to his being sick, and she always said that he was delicate, poor child, and that was why he was so cross and so much trouble.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='638'>"And is that why he eats so much?" Mrs. O"<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='o;mrs.' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.62' arousal='4.09666666667' dominance='5.74333333333'>Brien</entity> would ask.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='640'>"More likely it"s eating so much that gives him the kind of sickness that"s on him," Mrs. O"Brien would say. "But I tell you again, it"s no sickness at all he has. He"s just one of the Good People, and you could be rid of him and have your own child back any time you would do any of the things I would tell you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='641'>But not a word of this would Ellen ever heed. Terence was her own child, and he might be a bit troublesome, as any child might, but he was not really bad at all, and it was Kathleen, that was always so good, the Lord knew why, that made Mrs. O"Brien think that every child ought to be that way. But there was one strange thing about Terence, and Ellen herself had to admit it. After that very hour, when he was one day old, when Mrs. O"Brien came to see him and christened him, or tried to--she never felt sure till long afterward whether she had done it or not--he was always quiet when she was near. He would drive poor Ellen nearly crazy, in spite of all her excuses for him, when he was alone with her, but the moment that Mrs. O"Brien came into the house he would get as far away from her as he could, and then lie perfectly still and watch her, for all the world, as John said once, like a rat in a trap watching a cat. Ellen said that it was because he always remembered that it was Mrs. O"Brien who had dropped him once. To this John replied: "Then maybe he"ld be making you less trouble, Ellen, if you was to drop him yourself once or twice." But Mrs. O"<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chance;o;mrs.' adjectives='' verbs='be;say;know;have;do' valence='5.8925' arousal='3.925' dominance='5.8025'>Brien</entity> said that it was just because he knew what she would do to him if she had the chance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='642'>And there was another strange thing about Terence. As he grew a little older, he never could be got inside a church. Father Duffy had never even seen him, except when he came to the house while he was still a baby, and then Terence would scream and kick so, when the good priest came near him, that he never dared touch him. The first time that he came, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;child;mrs.;time' adjectives='right' verbs='be;christen;do;ask;come;tell' valence='5.975' arousal='4.20666666667' dominance='5.65416666667'>Ellen</entity> told him about Mrs. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;child;mrs.;time' adjectives='right' verbs='be;christen;do;ask;come;tell' valence='5.975' arousal='4.20666666667' dominance='5.65416666667'>O `` Brien</entity>"s christening the child, and asked him if it was right for her to do it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='643'>"Was the child looking sick, and as if he was likely to die?" Father <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='father' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='6.415' arousal='3.58' dominance='5.74'>Duffy</entity> asked.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='645'>"Then it was right for her to christen him," the priest answered, "and he"ll not need to be christened again. In fact, he can"t be christened again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='646'>But long after that, when they tried to take him to church, he would never go. If Peter and Ellen started for church with him he would run away from them. They could not even hold him. He would get away from them, and sometimes they could not tell how he did it, only he would be gone. And then the only way that they could find him was to go home again, and there he was sure to be, as safe as ever, only he had not been at church. And so, after a while, they stopped trying to make him go.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='647'>When the two children were old enough to play together, Terence never seemed to be happy except when he was with Kathleen. He did not care in the least to play with other boys. He did not seem to care in the least to play at all. All he wanted was to be with Kathleen. Kathleen never liked him, and she did not like to have him with her so much of the time. But she was too kind-hearted to hurt anybody in any way, even a boy whom she did not like, so she tried to treat him as nicely as she could, and she told nobody but her grandmother, to whom she told everything, that she was not as pleased to be with him as he was to be with her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='648'>Terence, in his turn, did not always treat Kathleen well, any more than he did anybody else. He was ill-natured with her and he played tricks on her that were not pleasant at all, and yet he wanted to be always with her. Perhaps it was partly because she was more kind to him than anybody else, except Ellen. For nobody else liked him. And if he was bad-tempered and unkind to other people, it made other people unkind and bad-tempered to him, but nothing could make <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;anybody;people' adjectives='other;unkind;bad-tempered' verbs='be;make' valence='4.823' arousal='3.799' dominance='5.526'>Kathleen</entity> unkind to anybody.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='649'>"It"s not fair you all are to Terence," Ellen said once to Mrs. O"Brien, "to think bad of him the way you do. There"s things about him that don"t seem right, I know, but those things don"t show the way he really is. I dunno if I"m making you understand me. I"m his mother and I know him better nor anybody else, and I know he"s different from the way he seems to you, and even the way he seems to me sometimes. And I"ll tell you how I know that. When I"m asleep I often dream about him. And when I dream about him, he looks a little the way he does other times, but he"s taller and he"s better-looking in the face, and he looks stronger and brighter and healthier like. And he speaks to me, and his voice is lower and pleasanter in the sound of it. And that"s the way he"ld be, I know, if he had his health, poor child, and if everything was right with him.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='650'>This was when Terence was six or seven years old. And Ellen often spoke in this way afterward.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='651'>And there was one thing that Terence did that almost everybody liked. I might as well say everybody except Kathleen. He played the fiddle. Nobody knew how he learned. There was a neighbor of the Sullivans who came from the same county in Ireland that they did, and he played a fiddle in an orchestra at a cheap theatre. One day Peter had gone to see this man and had taken little Terence with him. The fiddle was lying on the table. The two men went into another room and left Terence by himself. They were talking busily and they forgot about him. Then they heard a soft little tune played on the fiddle. "Who"s that playing my fiddle?" said the owner of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='652'>"Sure," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nobody' adjectives='sure' verbs='leave;say' valence='5.74333333333' arousal='4.13' dominance='6.39'>Peter</entity>, "we left nobody there but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nobody' adjectives='sure' verbs='leave;say' valence='5.74333333333' arousal='4.13' dominance='6.39'>Terence</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='653'>They went quickly back into the room and found Terence hastily laying the fiddle down where he had found it. "Ah, can"t I leave you alone a minute," said Peter, "but you must be meddling with things that don"t belong to you? What"ll I do now if you"ve gone and hurt the fiddle?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='654'>"Don"t be talking that way to the child," said the musician; "sure he did it no harm. But where at all did he learn to play that way? That"s what I"m thinking. Have you been letting him learn all this time and never told me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='655'>"He never learned at all that I know of," Peter answered. "I never saw him have a fiddle in his hand till this minute."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='656'>"It"s a strange thing, then," the musician said. "Anybody that can play a tune like he did that one has a right to play more and better. Where did you learn it, my boy?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='657'>"I never learned it at all," Terence answered; "I just saw the fiddle there and I thought I"ld see could I play it. But it"s little I could be doing with it, I"m thinking."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='658'>Peter was surprised enough to find that Terence could play a tune on a fiddle, and so was Ellen, when she heard about it. But they did not wonder at it so much as they would have done if they had known more about such things. They had a sort of notion that one person could play the fiddle and another could not, much as one person can move his ears and another cannot. So they thought little about it. But when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='money;fiddle;time' adjectives='little;own;last' verbs='save;buy;beg' valence='5.78083333333' arousal='4.50333333333' dominance='5.36166666667'>Terence</entity> begged them to buy him a fiddle of his own, they saved up money a little at a time, and at last they bought him one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='659'>Then for days Terence did nothing but play. He played simple little tunes at first, but soon he began to play harder ones. Then he got impatient with himself, as it seemed, and he began to play such music as nobody who heard him had ever heard before. Often he would not play when he was asked, but he would play for hours by himself, when he thought that no one was listening. His father brought his friend the musician to hear him, and he said that it was wonderful. He had never heard the fiddle played so well. Nobody had ever heard the fiddle played so well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='660'>And Kathleen never cared to hear Terence play. She did hear him play, many times, of course, and she listened politely, but she told her grandmother that she did not care about it at all. She would much rather hear the poor fiddler of the little orchestra, who had come from their county in Ireland. Their neighbor the fiddler himself was as much shocked as anyone to hear Kathleen talk like this. "Did you ever hear anybody play the fiddle like Terence plays it?" he asked her, when she said something of the sort to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='661'>"No," Kathleen answered. "I never heard anybody play it like Terence, but I have heard some play it better than Terence. You play it better."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='662'>"Oh, child," he said, "I"ld give all the money I"ll be earning in the next ten years if I could play like he does. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;t' adjectives='' verbs='do;see' valence='5.50625' arousal='4.10125' dominance='5.69375'>Don</entity>"t you see I can"t do half the things he does with it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='663'>"I know that," Kathleen said; "it isn"t the way he plays a bit that makes everybody talk so about him; it"s just the things he does. When he plays a tune it just doesn"t mean anything, and when you play a tune it does."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='664'>And that was as near as Kathleen could ever come to telling why she did not care about Terence"s playing. Everybody else said that it was wonderful, but she said that it didn"t mean anything. And when Kathleen talked in this way they said that she was too critical. That is what people will always tell you when you can see through a fraud and they cannot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='665'>You will suppose, without my telling you, that as soon as Kathleen was old enough to listen to them, her grandmother began telling her the old stories of Ireland. Often Terence would come and listen to them, too, for he seemed to be less afraid of Mrs. O"Brien as he grew a little older. But it never seemed to be because of the stories that he came; he only wanted to be near <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='story' adjectives='near' verbs='be;seem;come;want' valence='6.12' arousal='3.74666666667' dominance='5.365'>Kathleen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='666'>Mrs. O"Brien told the children stories about the Good People, and about the old heroes and kings of Ireland who had fought to save the country from its enemies.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='667'>"Don"t call them by that name," Mrs. O"Brien would answer. "They don"t like it, and if you call them by it they may do you harm."</paragraph>

I think that your mother will be very glad that you skipped this part with the ghost story in it. That is, of course, she won"t really be glad, because, since you are skipping it, you won"t know that there is any ghost story here, and so you won"t tell your mother that you skipped a ghost story, and so she won"t really care whether you skipped it or not.

So the other two put their heads together to think what would they do to hurt Donald and to ruin him entirely, so that he"ld have to give up his farm and they could get it cheap. Well, after a while they thought that if they could kill his ox he couldn"t plough his land, and then he"ld lose the use of it and he"ld have to give it up.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='701'>""It"s a bird," says Donald, "that I carry around with me, and it knows a great deal and tells me many a thing that it"s good for me to know. And it"s after telling me just now that the liquor you"re giving me is not the best you have."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='702'>""It"s the wonderful bird all out," says the landlady, and with that she went to another cask for the liquor. Then said she: "Will you sell that bird?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='733'>"There was a poor little bit of a boy once, and he had a hump on his back. He made his living by plaiting rushes and straw into hats and baskets and beehives, and he could do it better than anybody else for miles around. I don"t know what his right name was, but the people called him Lusmore, after the flower of that name. The flower, you know, is the one that some call fairy-cap--the Lord between us and harm!--and others call it foxglove. And they called him after it, because he would always be wearing a sprig of it in his cap. And in spite of having a crooked back, which often makes a body sulky, he was a good-natured little fellow, and never had a bad word or a bad thought for anybody.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='734'>"One day he had been at a fair to sell some of the things that he made out of straw and rushes, and as he was coming home he felt tired with the long walk. So he sat down to rest for a little, and he leaned his back on a bank of earth, not thinking that it was a place that was said to be a rath of the Good People. He sat there for a long time, and at last he began to hear music. It was very soft at first, and he had to listen hard to catch it at all. Then it sounded clearer, and after a little he could tell that there were fiddlers and pipers. Then he thought that he could hear the feet of dancers, and finally singers, and he could hear the words of the song that they sang. And these were the words:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='735'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='736'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mort;da' adjectives='' verbs='' valence='5.0' arousal='5.0' dominance='5.0'>Da Luan</entity>, da Mort,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='739'>"And there were no other words but these, and these the singers sang over and over and over again. And all they mean is, "Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday." After the singers had sung these words they would make a little pause and then they would go on with them. Lusmore knew now that the music came from inside the rath, and he knew well enough that it was the Good People he was listening to. He kept very quiet and listened, and it seemed a wonderfully sweet song to him, only after a while he got tired of hearing no other words. And he thought: "Maybe they"d like the song better themselves if there was more of it, and I wonder couldn"t I help them with it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='740'>"But he knew he must not disturb the Good People, so he waited till one of the little pauses, and then he sang very softly: "Augus da <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='augus;da;people' adjectives='little;good' verbs='sing;disturb;pause;know;wait' valence='5.889' arousal='3.691' dominance='5.601'>Cadine</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='741'>"Then he kept on singing all the words, along with the singers inside the rath, adding on his own new line every time:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='742'></paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='747'>"And that means: "Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday too."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='748'>"As he went on he sang a little louder and a little louder, till by and by the Good People in the rath began to listen to hear who or what it was that was singing their song with them, and then they caught the line that Lusmore had added. Then they were so pleased that they scarcely knew what to do, for they were more tired of the song than he was, only they did not know what to do to make it any better. And when they found it was somebody outside the rath that was singing it and was making more out of it than they ever did, they wanted to have him inside as soon as possible.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='749'>"So all at once Lusmore saw a door open in the rath, close beside him, and a great light streaming out, and then there was the sound of wings all around him, and next he saw the forms of the Good People pouring out and flying and whirling around him like a swarm of butterflies. They caught him up and carried him inside the rath, so lightly that he could not tell what was holding him, and he felt as if he was floating in the air. He was a little frightened at first, but when they had him inside the rath they set him up above all the musicians and thanked him for mending their song, and did him all sorts of honor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='750'>"Then he saw some of the Good People talking together in a little group, and presently they came up to him, and one of them said: "Lusmore, we"ve been thinking what will we do for you as a reward for mending our song, and we"ve decided to ask yourself what it is that you"ld rather we"ld give you. Think, now, what it is that you"ld rather have than anything else in the world."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='752'>""That"s easy done," said the one of them that had spoken before; "come on now and dance with us."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='753'>"Well, Lusmore, being crooked the way he was, and always weak, had never danced before in his life, and he never thought he could; but when they took hold of him on both sides and led him out, he found that he was dancing with the best of them, and he felt so light and he moved so easily that it seemed to him as if he was no more than a feather that the wind was blowing about. Then one of the Good People said to him, "Lusmore, where is your hump now?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='754'>"And he felt behind him for it, and it was not on his back at all. "Look down on the floor," said the one that had spoken to him, again. And he looked down, and there was his hump, lying on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hump' adjectives='' verbs='be;look;lie' valence='4.882' arousal='4.098' dominance='5.252'>the floor</entity> before him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='755'>"Then they all began dancing again and Lusmore with them, till he felt tired and then dizzy, and then he fell to the ground, and he knew nothing more till he awoke in the morning and found himself lying on the ground outside the rath, where he had sat down to rest the night before. The first thing he thought was that it was a dream that he had had, but he never had felt so well and so strong in his life as he did that minute. So he put his hand behind him, and there was no hump there. And, what was more, he had on a new suit of clothes that the Good People had given him. Then he went home and told his neighbors what had happened to him, and they could scarcely believe it. But everyone knew that there were Good People in that rath, and there was himself, too, the same boy as before, only without the hump, and so, at long last, they had to believe the whole story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='756'>"Well, the news of Lusmore"s wonderful cure was told all through the country, and at last it came to a place a long way off, where there was another boy lived that had a hump on his back.

So when his mother heard <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='boy;hump;way;mother' adjectives='rid;own;same' verbs='get;hear;take;have;think' valence='5.80666666667' arousal='3.9325' dominance='5.40666666667'>the way</entity> <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boy;hump;way;mother' adjectives='rid;own;same' verbs='get;hear;take;have;think' valence='5.80666666667' arousal='3.9325' dominance='5.40666666667'>Lusmore</entity> had had the hump taken off him, she thought maybe her boy could get rid of his own in the same way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='757'>"With that she set off with the boy and a neighbor of hers, and they came to where Lusmore lived, and asked him would he tell them all about how it was that he had the hump taken off him. And he went over it all with them and told them everything that he did and everything that happened to him. And in the end he went with them to show them the very spot where he had sat down beside the rath, and there they left the little hunchback, and told him to do everything just as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hunchback;spot;everything;end;rath' adjectives='little' verbs='do;sit;show;leave;have;go;tell' valence='5.38461538462' arousal='3.83538461538' dominance='5.31846153846'>Lusmore</entity> had done it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='776'>This is to be another sort of chapter altogether. I am going to tell you now what happened. The eighteen years are gone now and we have come to the time when there is something to tell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='777'>When those eighteen years began, you know, Kathleen and Terence were not much more than born. So, if you have got as far as addition and can add eighteen to nothing and find that it makes eighteen, you will see that by this time they were about eighteen years old. John O"Brien and his mother and Kathleen did not live on the east side of Central Park any more. John had got on better and better with the work that he was doing. After a while, instead of having to do work of common kinds any more, he had been put in charge of other men who were doing it. After another while he learned so much about the work and how it was done and how it ought to be done, that he was made one of the partners in the company that did it. So he got a good deal more money and he was able to take his mother and Kathleen out of the little tenement where she was born, and to live in a better place. Then he had a house of his own, over on the west side of the Park, and it was there that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='house;park;side' adjectives='west;own' verbs='be;live;have' valence='5.92166666667' arousal='3.71416666667' dominance='5.5575'>Kathleen</entity> lived when she was eighteen years old.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='778'>Peter had not got along so well. John himself employed him, but Peter knew enough to go only just so far, and there he stuck. He lived in a little better place than he did at first, but he could never make his way like John. And then Terence, as he grew up, made a good deal of trouble. He never would learn anything useful and he never would do anything useful. He never helped his father at all, and always his father had to help him. If there was any fight or any accident or anything troublesome or wrong within a mile, Terence was always in the midst of it. He was constantly getting his head and his ribs broken, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;people;s;thing;window;rib' adjectives='other' verbs='break;be;pay;have;get' valence='5.490625' arousal='3.854375' dominance='5.32875'>Peter</entity> was always having to pay for other people"s things that he had broken, from their heads to their windows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='779'>Ellen"s excuse for him, that he was never well and had never been quite himself since he was born, was pretty well worn out. For, people said, he had always been exactly the same ever since he was born, and if that same was not himself, who was it? But Ellen kept saying it none the less. Many a time Mrs. O"Brien tried to make her believe that the boy was a changeling, and not her child at all, and many a time she begged Ellen to let her only try a charm to see if he was, but Ellen never would hear of it. She always said what she had said at first, that nobody knew him but her. She saw him better when she dreamed about him, for then she saw him as he really was, without all the harm that had been done to him by all the sickness that had been on him one time and another.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='780'>You might suppose that anybody who could play the fiddle as well as Terence need not have any trouble in making his own living. He might have found a place in a theatre, like the man whose fiddle he had played on first. He might have taught others to play. Or he might have played all by himself, and hundreds of people would have paid to hear him. But he would play only when he chose, and he would never do anything useful with his fiddle. And everybody said he played so wonderfully--everybody except <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everybody' adjectives='' verbs='say;play' valence='6.73' arousal='4.12' dominance='6.585'>Kathleen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='781'>And this brings us back to Kathleen. Terence heard before he was many years old something about the plan that Peter and John had made, that he and Kathleen should be married when they grew up, if they both liked the plan. He seemed to forget all about this last part, "if they both liked the plan." He liked the plan himself and he seemed to think that that was enough. He had talked about it to Kathleen many times, before they were both eighteen years old, and it troubled Kathleen so that she tried never to see Terence when she could possibly help it. She had always disliked him, though she had always tried not to show it; but as they got a little older and she found that there was no other way to keep away from him at all, she had to tell him so.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='782'>But do you suppose that made any difference with Terence? Well, it did make a difference with him, but he did not let anybody see that it did. When Kathleen told him for the first time that she did not like him at all, he went away by himself. He went straight to the hill that is in the north end of the Park, and there he threw himself down on his face on the grass. For hours he lay there, trembling and crying, and beating the ground with his feet and his fists. And it would take another book as large as this to tell all that he was saying to himself or to the grass, or to something under the grass--how can I tell? And you would not want to read the book. It is not likely that you will ever see anybody in such a rage as he was in. But at the end of it he stood up and looked just as he usually did, and went straight to the O"Briens" and stayed all the evening and kept as near Kathleen as he could, and stared at her all the time. And he talked to her then and afterward, just as if she had told him that she liked him better than anybody else that she knew.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='783'>So Kathleen had to go to her grandmother, as she always did when she was in any trouble, and tell her all about it. And her grandmother told her that she and Terence were both a good deal too young to think of anything of the sort, and that she would do all that she could to help her. But she could not do much. She told John about it, and he said that he should be sorry if the plan that he and Peter had made could not be carried out, but he would forbid it himself, as long as Terence was so lazy and so worthless and so bad as he was now. When he got a little older, he hoped that everything would be better, and there was no hurry about anything.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='784'>And though Terence made her so much trouble, Kathleen had many other things to think about. She went to school and learned a great deal, and her grandmother taught her a great deal more. Her grandmother told her stories still, and, though she was nearly eighteen and felt that she was getting so dreadfully old, she still liked stories. Then she had a good many friends, and she spent much of her time with them. She visited Ellen often, too, going to see her at times when she thought that Terence would not be at home. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='north;park;hill;time;end;side;friend' adjectives='many;east' verbs='live;tell;have;walk' valence='6.20066666667' arousal='3.52066666667' dominance='5.69266666667'>Ellen</entity> and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='north;park;hill;time;end;side;friend' adjectives='many;east' verbs='live;tell;have;walk' valence='6.20066666667' arousal='3.52066666667' dominance='5.69266666667'>Peter</entity> still lived on the east side of the Park, and some of her friends lived there, too, so that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='north;park;hill;time;end;side;friend' adjectives='many;east' verbs='live;tell;have;walk' valence='6.20066666667' arousal='3.52066666667' dominance='5.69266666667'>Kathleen</entity> often walked through the north end of the Park, near that hill that I have told you about so many times before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='785'>Kathleen was fond of this part of the Park, as everybody is who knows it. But especially she was fond of one little spot that nobody else seemed to notice much. So Kathleen got a feeling that this one place belonged to her, and she was all the more fond of it because of that. It was a tiny little basin of water, near the path, but up a grassy bank. On the side toward the path it was all open, but on the other side there were rocks, and out of a little cleft in the rocks ran a bit of a stream of water that fed the little basin. Then, around the rocks and over them there was more grass, and the hill rose at both sides and above. On the edge of the hill, right over the basin, was a pine-tree, and around it were other trees. Their branches came together over the water and almost shut out the sky from it, but not quite.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='786'>Every time that Kathleen passed it, she went up the bank and looked into the still water. She had a feeling that if she ever went by and did not do this the water would miss her and would feel hurt. When she did this by daylight and in summer, if she stood up and looked into the water, she could see a patch of branches and green leaves and blue sky through them, about as big as the basin itself, and that was scarcely larger than a fair-sized tub. But if she stooped down close to the water and looked into it, she saw that there was a great deal of sky under it, below the trees, which grew upside down. There was almost as much sky under the water as she could see above it, and she believed that there would prove to be quite as much if she could only get her head where she could see it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='787'>She used to look in at night sometimes, too, and try to see if there were any stars in that sky; but in the summer she never could see any, because the leaves on the trees were so thick that they almost hid the sky, and they seemed to be thicker and to hide the sky more by night than they did by day. In the winter it was different. Then there were no leaves, but only branches and twigs, which covered the sky like lace work, and through these Kathleen sometimes thought that she could see a star or two in the water, but she was seldom quite sure. Yet she never passed the place without looking in it, to see the green leaves and the blue sky or the black leaves and the almost black sky, or the stars, if she could find any.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='794'>On a certain day--the last day of April it was--there was a good deal of excitement in the fairy palace under the hill. The reason of it was that a new fairy had come to live there. Perhaps you never heard of a baby fairy. I have read a good many stories about fairies that said nothing about any such thing. Now, you needn"t try to be so bright about it and say that of course there must be baby fairies, or there could not be any grown-up fairies. That isn"t so at all. Fairies are not like men about growing old and dying and other fairies taking their places. I have heard of a fairy funeral, but I can"t imagine how it happened, and I think that the story about it must have been a mistake. If you have read this book as far as here, you know that most fairies are thousands of years old, and you know, too--for Naggeneen has told you--what is likely to become of them in the end. Still, there is no sort of doubt that now and then a new fairy is born, and there was one born on this day. He was the son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='consequence;person;fairy;prince;son' adjectives='' verbs='be;guess' valence='5.80692307692' arousal='4.30769230769' dominance='5.41076923077'>the King</entity> and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='consequence;person;fairy;prince;son' adjectives='' verbs='be;guess' valence='5.80692307692' arousal='4.30769230769' dominance='5.41076923077'>Queen</entity>, and you can guess well enough that a fairy prince is a person of some consequence.</paragraph>

She was on her way home through the Park, and she had meant to get there before dark, but it was a little later than she had thought, and she saw the red in the sky before her getting darker and duller every minute.

On the grass, close beside the path, there were ever so many boys and girls--at least she thought at first that they were boys and girls--dancing. The grass in that place sloped upward from the path, and the ground was a little hollowed, in a sort of shell shape. All around the place, except where the path was, trees and bushes hung over the grass. The buds were just opening here, too, and the air was full of the smell of the new spring grass and leaves, which always grows stronger in the evening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='828'>Kathleen stood gazing at the boys and girls dancing. There were so many of them that she could not count them. She thought that they seemed to be a little younger and smaller than herself. The boys all wore green jackets and red caps. When she looked at them more closely she could not tell whether they were boys at all or not. They looked more like old men. And she could scarcely believe that either, because they danced so fast and seemed so lively. Her father could not dance like that, she was sure, and he was not an old man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='829'>But she had no doubt that the girls were girls. Usually she could not tell a pretty girl from an ugly one, any more than any other girl can, but she knew that these were pretty. Anybody would. They had long, golden hair that hung all loose and free and came down to their knees, when the little wind did not blow it away in some other direction. They had deep, soft eyes. They were dressed in long, white gowns, so white that they shone, now like a sheet of pale light and now with a hundred little sparkles, as the water of the sea does sometimes, when it is broken into foam by the prow of a ship. All the men carried lanterns and all the girls had something that looked like long flower-stems, only there were tiny lights on the ends of them, instead of flowers. These and the lanterns did not seem to trouble them at all in dancing, and if <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='firefly;dancing;light;swarm;dancer;trouble;lantern' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;see;have;seem;think' valence='5.71' arousal='4.09529411765' dominance='5.47529411765'>Kathleen</entity> had seen the lights and had not seen the dancers, she would have thought that they were a swarm of fireflies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='830'>She had scarcely stood there for a minute before one of the men came up to her and asked her to dance with him. Kathleen"s first thought was that she ought to be afraid, and her second thought was that she was not afraid a bit. She liked dancing and she had just been wishing that she could dance with these boys and girls. Then she wondered if it was quite right. Then she could not see what there could be wrong about it. Then she let the little man take her hand and she stepped off the path upon the grass and began to dance. She heard the other girls calling to her again, farther up the path. She called back to them: "I am coming in a minute! Wait for me!" And then she went on dancing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='831'>When she had been only looking on, the dancing had seemed to Kathleen to be quite wonderful, but now she found that she could do it all nearly as well as the little boys and girls. She thought that it might be because the little old man was a better partner for dancing than she had ever had before. They danced around by themselves, moving in and out among the others, no matter how close together they were, and always finding their way, now in the midst of the whole company and now out beyond the very edge of it, and then suddenly all the dancers would join hands and whirl about in a great circle, so fast that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='whirl;dancer;company;edge;matter;other;way;foot;midst;hand;circle;ground' adjectives='very;close;great;whole' verbs='be;join;dance;move;tell;touch;find' valence='5.7776' arousal='3.8204' dominance='5.5728'>Kathleen</entity> could not tell whether her feet were touching the ground at all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='832'>It seemed to her that she had never done anything so delightful before. She did not think of going on with the other girls any more. She did not think of getting home early, or of anything but the dancing. She could not tell at all how long she had been dancing, but it was all dark, except for the little lanterns and the little lights on the flower-stems, and the stars were all out in the sky. And then somebody said: "It is time to go."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='834'>And Kathleen thought of nothing but of going with the queer little old men and the beautiful little girls.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='835'>She looked down into it, and there was no doubt about the stars now. There were hundreds of them down under the water, shining up through it from as far below, it seemed, as the stars in the sky were up above. The dancers who came to it first stepped on the surface of the pool, and it bore them up as if it had been a floor of glass. Then Kathleen saw that the rocks behind the pool were not as she had ever seen them before. There was an opening straight into the hill, and when she came nearer still she saw that the water was no longer a little pool. It was more like a long, narrow lake, and it covered the bottom of the opening that led into the hill. All the people were going in, walking along <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;path;ice;people' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;have;walk' valence='6.04454545455' arousal='3.79454545455' dominance='5.32090909091'>the path</entity> of water as easily as if it had been a path of ice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='836'>Again it seemed to Kathleen that she ought to be afraid, and again it seemed to her, still more clearly, that she was not afraid. When she came to the water she put her foot upon it and walked along it as easily as the others were doing. She thought that she would remember that this water could be walked on, and would try it the next day. She had never thought of trying it before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='837'>But now she and the others were moving along the path into the hill. It was still dark, except for the lights that they carried and the stars that shone up through the water. And these were not the reflection of any stars in the sky, for there was no sky to be seen over them now--only rocks. Then there was a pale violet light shining on the walls of the passage ahead of them. Then, as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='water;moment;star;gold;floor' adjectives='faint;yellow' verbs='shine;be;look;walk;see;seem' valence='6.00791666667' arousal='3.98041666667' dominance='5.55583333333'>Kathleen</entity> looked down at the water again, to see if she were really walking on it, she saw that there were no more stars, but the water was of a faint, shining yellow, and in a moment she was not walking on water any more, but on a floor, that seemed to her to be all of gold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='838'>She could do nothing now but stand still and look around at the wonderful sight. All around her were walls of silver, so bright that they reflected everything in the great hall, and she could not tell at all how large it was. But she made out that in the middle was a great dome, held up by the most wonderful gleaming columns of gold and silver, first a column of gold and then a column of silver, and these she saw again and again in the walls all about. She could not see the top of the dome from where she stood, it was so high, but all around the sides of it she saw great diamonds and rubies and emeralds, some of them as big as her head, that poured down soft white and red and green lights, and these she saw, too, shining up, a little dimmer, from the gold of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;diamond;gold;wall;light;top;mirror;dome;emerald;ruby;side' adjectives='great;good;big;little;high;green;dimmer;white;soft;red' verbs='shine;be;see;stand;pour' valence='5.97516129032' arousal='4.11258064516' dominance='5.63387096774'>the floor</entity>, which was almost as good a mirror as the walls.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='839'>The sides of the dome, in which the jewels were set, were all of bands and lines and ribbons of gold and silver, wonderfully woven together into shapes and patterns which she could not follow or trace out with her eyes, because they seemed to be always slowly moving--turning and twisting and winding and wreathing about, never for a moment the same, but always new and always beautiful. And when this was reflected in the golden floor it was like the wavering shapes in water that is almost still, but yet has little waves that dance and break up every reflection that is seen in it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='840'>And still, although she saw no lamps except the great white and red and green gems, there came from somewhere--perhaps from the top of the dome, she thought--that violet light that she had seen first on the walls of the passage, and it filled the whole hall, like the glow of a glorious sunset that never faded. And all this was inside a hill that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;hill;anything' adjectives='wonderful' verbs='be;see;know;have' valence='6.124' arousal='3.925' dominance='5.956'>Kathleen</entity> had known all the years of her life, and she had never seen anything wonderful about it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='847'>While Kathleen is wondering at the fairy palace I will explain to you the subject which you have been wondering about. If you only knew more we could get on with the story so much faster. It is most annoying. And you have been brought up so well too! I don"t see that it is anybody"s fault but your own. You have been wondering all along how it was that the fairies seemed to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fairy' adjectives='little;smaller' verbs='be;say;hear;have;seem;wonder' valence='6.025' arousal='4.056875' dominance='5.695'>Kathleen</entity> to be, as I said, only a little smaller than herself, when you have always heard that fairies were so very little.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='848'>Well, to think of your not understanding that! I am bound to say that when I was of your age I was just as ignorant about it as you are now, but then, children now have a good many more advantages than they had in my day. Considering how few advantages we had, it is a great credit to people of my age that we know anything at all, and, considering how many of them you have, it is a disgrace to you that you do not know everything.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='849'>When I was a child I used to read about fairies, and the book would say that they were six inches tall, or that they were about as big as a man"s thumb, or it would tell about their sitting in flowers. And then I would look at the pictures and they would appear to be as high as a man"s knees, or even higher. And I could not understand it. But I made up my mind to find out about it. That is what you must do, when there is anything that you don"t understand. There are very few things that you can"t do, if you make up your mind to them, except things that are too hard for you. I hate to have morals getting into a story as much as you do, but that is such a good one that it might as well go in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='850'>Now I will tell you. Fairies can be of any size they like, and you never can tell what size they are going to be, from one minute to another. They can be giants, if they like. And as soon as they had Kathleen with them they could make her of any size they liked too. So as long as she was among them they could keep her and themselves just the same size, or as near to it as they liked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='851'>But when fairies are not taking the trouble to be of any particular size--when they are letting themselves alone, as you might say--then they are about six inches tall. And I think that is a very good size to be. It would be better if you were of that size. You wouldn"t eat so much and you wouldn"t be so much in the way, and you would be much better-looking. Just think: if your face were only three-quarters of an inch long, all those features of it that are so disagreeable wouldn"t show so plainly. You might even look rather pretty. You wouldn"t need to be so, but you might look so.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='852'>And it would be so much easier to know where you were, if you were of that size, that it would save your mother a good deal of trouble. All she would have to do would be to put you on the mantelpiece, and then you could not get off without breaking your necks--and that would be such an advantage. I don"t mean that it would be an advantage to break your necks, because then who would read this book, and why should I take all this trouble to write it? I mean, it would be an advantage that you could not get off. Well, now you see how much better off you would be if you were only six inches tall, and now you understand about the fairies.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='860'>Kathleen followed him to the opposite side of the hall and through a door, into another room. It was much smaller than the hall, but it was just as beautiful, in its own way. There was a woman in this room--another of the beautiful girls, Kathleen would have said--lying on a gold couch. Her hair was hanging down over the pillow on which her head lay, so that Kathleen could scarcely tell which was the hair and which was the gold of the couch. There was a crown lying on a little table beside her, and so Kathleen guessed that she was the Queen.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='867'>Kathleen went to the cradle and looked at the baby. It was wide awake and it stared at her like a little owl. Except for that, it looked like any other baby.

Then as soon as I was old enough to go to school, they sent me, and I came back every night, and they gave me money to buy all my own food outside, and I have done that ever since, and I have never eaten a bit of the Good People"s food."</paragraph>

And then, you see, if I ate anything here I could not go out to go to school, and so I could not teach them. And it is all so strange. It almost makes me cry, it is such a bother sometimes, and then they are so sorry about it themselves and I am so sorry for them, and it almost makes me laugh sometimes, because they can never learn anything.

Maybe to-morrow night you"ll be able to make us see it clearer."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='917'>Terence had come back to where Kathleen was. "Isn"t it funny," he said, "and yet isn"t it a pity? I try to teach them as well as I can, but they never can understand at all."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='918'>"And do you mean to say," said Kathleen, "that you haven"t got any farther in geometry than that? Why, that"s only the fifth proposition of the first book."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='919'>"Of course I"ve got farther than that," Terence answered, "but they haven"t, and they never will. I have been trying to teach them that proposition--oh, I don"t know how long--and they never will learn it in the world. They want to learn to build railways and bridges and all sorts of things, but how can anybody even get ready to build a railway or a bridge till he"s got over this bridge and the rest of the geometry? I don"t know whether I can ever learn it all myself, but I"m going to the School of Engineering up at the University, next spring, to learn chemistry, and qualitative analysis, and calculus, and analytical mechanics, and graphical statics, and metallurgy, and thermodynamics, and hydraulics, and a lot of other things. But these people here will still be at work on this same triangle years after I am dead, if they have anybody to teach them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='920'>"Now, Terence, my boy," said the King, "there"s one thing you can do for us we can understand. Give us a tune out of the fiddle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='921'>Kathleen was startled to hear this boy named Terence asked to play on the fiddle, just as if he had been the other Terence whom she knew. She wondered if he played like the other Terence. She scarcely dared wait to hear, and she felt as if she should like to run away, only she did not know where to run.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='922'>But she did not think any more about running after Terence began to play. This was different. And yet in one way it was the same. For the music that Terence was playing was just the music that the other Terence often played and just what most people liked to hear him play best, though Kathleen had always liked it as little as anything else that he did. She had never heard anyone else play it till now. And now it was so different. She could scarcely tell the difference, and yet she could feel it in every clear note that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='note;difference;bow' adjectives='clear' verbs='feel;draw;tell' valence='5.71285714286' arousal='3.50714285714' dominance='5.66428571429'>Terence</entity> drew out with his bow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='923'>When she was a little girl, almost as long ago as she could remember, she used to say, when the other Terence played this very music, that it did not mean anything. But now it meant something. Meant something! It meant--everything, Kathleen thought, and yet she could not tell at all what it meant. It was not happiness that it meant, and it was not sorrow; it was not merry, and it was not grave. Sometimes it was light and gentle and sweet, and flowed along as if it were a little fountain of music, bubbling and bubbling out of a hidden place; then it would be slower, but fine and firm, and full and free and true. It seemed to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='longing;something' adjectives='deep' verbs='go;be;seem;tell;mean' valence='5.44125' arousal='4.1875' dominance='5.08625'>Kathleen</entity> to mean so much, and yet she could not tell what, except that there was something like a deep longing that went all through it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='924'>And that made her think of the other Terence"s music again, for she remembered now, though she had never thought of it before, that there was a longing in his music too. Perhaps she had done wrong, she thought, to say that it did not mean anything. Still, this was so different. If the other Terence"s fiddle had ever seemed to be longing for anything, it had seemed to be hopeless, and the fiddle always seemed to be bitterly laughing at those who were listening to it and thinking that it was so fine. She had never thought of anything like this before, but it seemed clear to her now, listening to the same music played so differently. For now, below all the longing and sounding through it, there were strength and hope and life and faith in something good.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='925'>I do not say that Kathleen thought all this out while she was listening. She only felt the most of it. But she felt it so much that she scarcely knew what she was doing, and she moved by little and little toward Terence, till she was nearer to him than anybody else, and looked at him as if he were something more wonderful than she had ever seen before, till she found that she could not look at him, because her eyes were wet. And then the music stopped.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='926'>Then said the King: "I said that was something that we could understand, Terence, but I dunno if it is. It"s the wonderful player you are all out, but I never heard you play like that before, and I think there"s something in it that"s more than I can find out. That"s enough of it for to-night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='927'>Terence had already come back to Kathleen. She could scarcely speak to him even yet. "Who taught you to play like that?" she said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='928'>"I don"t quite know," he answered, "whether anybody taught me. They taught me to play here, and the music that I just played is their music, but I don"t play it the way they do. I don"t know why that is. Just as soon as they had taught me so that I could play at all, I began to play in my own way. Their music is sweet and bright and merry and sparkling, and sometimes it seems to be sad, but it never means anything."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='929'>Kathleen was startled again to hear Terence say the very words that she had said so many times about the other Terence"s music. "But I never played before in my life," Terence went on, "the way I have been playing just now. I think it was because you were here. You understood, and so I thought of nothing but you all the time that I was playing, and I think it made me play better. They never understand. They love music and they hate geometry, but they understand one just as well as the other."</paragraph>

The violet light on the walls of the passage grew dimmer; she saw the lights that the men and women carried, shining ahead of her and all around her. Then she looked down at the water and saw the stars shining up through it, as if there were another sky far down under her feet. And then--she felt the cool, fresh breath of the outside air, and it was delicious to her, and she was standing on her own little pool, and deep down under it there were thousands of stars. She and all the others walked--or drifted, as it seemed to Kathleen--up the bank of sweet-smelling new grass, to the little hollowed place, with the trees and the bushes growing around it and hanging over it, where Kathleen had first seen the Good People. And then they began the dance.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='955'>When Kathleen did not come home at the time she was expected, her father and her grandmother were not much surprised at first. She was in the habit of going where she pleased and of coming back when she pleased. If she chose to be an hour or two late her father or her grandmother might ask her why, or they might not think of it. So, on that May Eve when she danced with the Good People, as it began to get late and still she did not come, they had no doubt that she had decided to make her visit at the Sullivans" a little longer than she had intended. When it got later and still she did not come, her father said that he would walk over to the Sullivans" and come back with her. He never thought of not finding her there. Even when he got there and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;harm' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;get;think;say;have;go;come;tell' valence='5.72266666667' arousal='3.98133333333' dominance='5.77'>Ellen</entity> told him that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;harm' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;get;think;say;have;go;come;tell' valence='5.72266666667' arousal='3.98133333333' dominance='5.77'>Kathleen</entity> had gone away hours ago and had said that she was going home, he did not think that any harm could have come to her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='957'>But when he got home again and found that she was not there, and when he told his mother that she was not at the Sullivans", they both began to be a little worried. They told each other over and over that Kathleen knew how to take care of herself and that no harm was likely to come to her, but they both doubted their own words. Late at night <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sullivans;nonsense;way' adjectives='likely' verbs='be;search;look;take;go;think;know' valence='5.70823529412' arousal='4.02705882353' dominance='5.27764705882'>John</entity> went to the Sullivans" again, taking <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sullivans;nonsense;way' adjectives='likely' verbs='be;search;look;take;go;think;know' valence='5.70823529412' arousal='4.02705882353' dominance='5.27764705882'>the way</entity> that he thought <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sullivans;nonsense;way' adjectives='likely' verbs='be;search;look;take;go;think;know' valence='5.70823529412' arousal='4.02705882353' dominance='5.27764705882'>Kathleen</entity> would be likely to take, and looking everywhere for her, though he knew that to search for her in such a way as that was nonsense.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='958'>The Sullivans had all gone to bed when he got there, but Peter got up and walked back with him, by another way. They went to a police station and asked if there had been any accident--if any girl had been hurt and taken to a hospital. There had been no accident that night. They went home and waited again. At last John could wait no longer. He and Peter started out again and went different ways. They went to other police stations and asked if there had been accidents. There had been one or two, but nobody at all like Kathleen had had anything to do with them. They went to hospitals and asked about all the new patients. There was not one of them that was at all like <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be' valence='6.4725' arousal='3.4825' dominance='5.71'>Kathleen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='959'>It does not belong to the story to tell how they went on searching. All the next day they searched. They tried every way that they knew, and every way that the police knew, and every way that anybody could think of, to find her, and there was no trace. Late that day one of the girls who had walked through the Park with Kathleen came to see her, not knowing that she was lost. Then she told where she had seen Kathleen last. She told how <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='other' adjectives='' verbs='want;get;drop;think;go;say;call;have;answer;follow;tell' valence='5.87222222222' arousal='3.90277777778' dominance='5.73277777778'>Kathleen</entity> had dropped behind the others, though she had said that she wanted to get home early, how they had called to her, how she had answered, and how they had gone on, thinking that she would soon follow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='960'>Then Mrs. O"Brien said to John: "You do not need to search for her any longer. She is with the Good People. I have seen that place often, and it always looked to me like a place where the Good People might be. Last night was May Eve. There is no time in the whole year when the Good People have more power, and especially to carry off young girls. They have taken her with them. Some time she may come back, or some time we may get her back, but it is of no use for you to search for her any more."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='961'>But John went on searching still. The next day and for many days he looked for her and tried every means to find her, but she could not be found. Again and again his mother told him that it was of no use, but still he said: "It might be some use, and I wouldn"t be easy if I didn"t try."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='962'>By and by there came a time when even John did not think that there was any use in trying longer. He read many papers, from many different cities, hoping always to find something about some unknown girl who had been found, sick or hurt or helpless, somewhere, but he said little about her. He went on with his old work, and he and his mother were alone and lonely in the house. Then John came to believe that Kathleen was dead. He told his mother this and she answered: "<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mother' adjectives='dead' verbs='answer;be;tell' valence='5.42' arousal='3.986' dominance='5.032'>Kathleen</entity> is not dead."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='963'>"And how do you know that, mother?" John said. "You always say that the Good People took her away, but that might be true, and still she might be dead by now. And the Good People might not have taken her at all. How do you know?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='967'>"The banshee?" said John. "There"s no banshee here. There"s banshees only in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;banshee' adjectives='' verbs='' valence='4.29' arousal='5.045' dominance='4.575'>Ireland</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='968'>"Our banshee is here," his mother answered. "I know she is here. You"ve heard me tell of her. She"s the sad, mourning woman of the Good People that weeps and wails about the house when anybody of the family is to die, anywhere in the world. It"s true, as you say, that the banshees mostly stay in Ireland, though they are heard to cry and moan for those of the family who are to die in any part of the world. But sometimes the banshee leaves Ireland with the family that she belongs to, and so did ours. Wouldn"t I know her voice? Didn"t I hear her wail and scream before your father died, so many, many years ago? Oh, I"ld never forget it. I"ld know her voice."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='969'>"Then why didn"t you hear her," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='didn;t' adjectives='didn' verbs='ask;die;hear;know;be' valence='4.87125' arousal='4.69625' dominance='5.105'>John</entity> asked "before <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='didn;t' adjectives='didn' verbs='ask;die;hear;know;be' valence='4.87125' arousal='4.69625' dominance='5.105'>Kitty</entity> died, and why didn"t you know before that she was to die?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='970'>"I did hear the banshee that time," his mother answered, "but I couldn"t tell that it was Kitty that was to die. It was the night before she died. I heard a little moan, that was more like the wind than anything else, and then it grew louder, and it was a sob and a soft wail. It did not grow very loud. Then I could hear that it was like the keen that the women cry over the dead at home. I knew that it was the banshee. No, I could not be wrong about her; I had heard her before. But I never thought of Kitty then. I thought: "I"m an old woman--an old woman--though I would never let them say so; and now my time has come. I shall soon be with him again. If I could only see a child of John"s and Kitty"s before I go, I"ld go gladly. If I could only say to him: "Before I came to you I held John"s and Kitty"s child in my arms," then I"ld go gladly." That was what I said to myself that time. But it was Kitty that the banshee meant. And now, though I felt then the first time that I was an old woman, here I am still, and Kitty is gone and the child is grown up to be a woman and she is lost. But she is not dead, John; she is not dead. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='banshee;couldn;t' adjectives='ld' verbs='die;hear' valence='4.386' arousal='5.122' dominance='4.828'>Kathleen</entity> couldn"t die without I"ld hear the banshee."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='971'>It was not once only that John and his mother talked together in some such way as this. It was a dozen times at least, perhaps two dozen times, that she told him that, whatever had come to Kathleen, she was not dead--that she could not be dead, because the banshee had not moaned and cried about the house, as she was sure to do before any one of the O"Briens could die. And so John, seeing his mother careworn and anxious, but never so full of sorrow as himself, came to think that he ought to bear it better, and not let her see him always so troubled and so sad. Yet he could not believe all that his mother said quite as she believed it, and she had to tell him all of it again and again, and she told him, too, that when the time came she meant to try to get Kathleen back from the Good People. And after a while John did not think every time that he heard anybody at the door that it was Kathleen at last, and all in the house went on as it had gone before, only that Kathleen was not there. But that "only" was enough, and it was a different house.</paragraph>

And then, to those who were watching, it seemed as if she saw something, though they could see nothing but her.

She took it out, and it was the little box of ointment that the Queen had given her to put on the baby"s eyes.

It seemed to her all so plain. And they said that it had been a year. She could not understand it at all. She laid the little gold box on her bureau, under her glass, and went to bed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1011'>The next morning Kathleen could think about things a little more clearly. She could not remember what she had seen and heard in the hill quite so distinctly. She had not forgotten anything, but it all seemed dimmer in her mind than it had been, as if it were long ago. And still it seemed as if it had all happened yesterday. Everybody whom she knew had heard that she was at home again, and everybody came to see her. And they all told her that she had been away for a year. She could not doubt it any longer, and yet she could not understand it. What had she been doing all that time? She could remember just enough to fill up one night and one day, and that was all. Could it be that she had slept for three hundred and sixty-four days and been awake for only one? No, she could not believe that. And so, at last, she came to her grandmother to ask if she could explain it to her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1012'>"No," the old woman said, "I can"t do that. It"s too wonderful for any of us to understand. But it"s no more wonderful than many things that are true, and I"ve heard tales of it before. Often one stays in the land of the Good People, and in other places, too, and thinks that the time has been short, when it has been long. Shall I tell you what happened once to a monk--a holy man--much more wonderful than what happened to you?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1013'>"One day this monk was in the garden of the monastery where he lived, reading in his book. He was reading in the Psalms, where it says, "For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night, things that are counted nothing, shall their years be."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1014'>"And he found it hard to believe that even to God Himself a thousand years could seem no more than a day. As he was thinking of this, a bird in a tree near him began to sing, and the song was so beautiful that he forgot the psalm that he had been reading and his thoughts about it, and only listened to the bird. It seemed to him that in all his life he had never heard any music so beautiful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1015'>"But soon the bird flew to another tree, farther from the monastery, and the monk followed, to listen to its song again. Then the bird flew to a tree farther off, and still the monk followed. Once more the bird flew to another tree, and once more the monk followed it, for it seemed to him that as long as that bird sang he could listen to nothing else and could think of nothing else. But he saw that the sun had gone down and he knew that it was time for him to go back to the monastery. As he went back he looked at the colors that the sun had left behind it in the sky, and he thought that they were as beautiful to see as the voice of the bird was to hear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1016'>"They were all faded and the darkness had come on when he reached the monastery and went in. And if he had wondered at the song of the bird and at the colors in the sky, he wondered yet more when he found himself again in the place where he had lived for many years. For many things about the place were changed, and the men in it were all changed. There was not one face among them that he knew. One of the brothers saw him and came toward him, and he said: "Brother, why have all these changes been made here since this morning? And who are all these whom I do not know? I scarcely know my own monastery."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1017'>"And the other answered: "Who are you that ask this, and why do you come here? For you wear the dress of our order, but you are a stranger. You speak as if you knew the place, yet I myself have lived here for fifty years and I have never seen you before."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1018'>"Then the monk told his name and told how he had been at mass in the chapel in the morning and had then gone into the garden to read. And he told how he had read in the Psalms, "A thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past," and how, while he was thinking of these words, he had heard the bird singing. He told how he had followed the bird, till he saw that night was coming, and then had come back to the monastery.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1019'>"And the other said: "I remember now that when I first came into this place they told me of a legend that a monk of your name had gone out of this monastery a hundred and fifty years before, and had never come back and had never been heard of again. And now, counting my own fifty years here, that must have been two hundred years ago."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1020'>"Then the monk said: "God has given me such happiness as He gives to few until they are with Him in Heaven, for these two hundred years have seemed to me to be only a part of a day. Now hear my confession, for I know that I soon shall die."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1021'>"So the other monk heard his confession, and before midnight he died. And this was <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='god;meaning;word' adjectives='' verbs='be;choose;have;show' valence='5.9975' arousal='3.895' dominance='5.8075'>the way</entity> that God had chosen to show him the meaning of His word."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1022'>It was a pretty story, but Kathleen understood no more than before. "No," said her grandmother, "you cannot understand, and I cannot. We live here such a little while and we are so shut in by time, that we cannot understand how it is with those who live always. But we shall understand when the right time comes, and then we shall wonder how we could ever wonder. And I will tell you another story about it, not to make you understand, but to show you how it is.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1023'>"Long ago Finn McCool was the great champion of Ireland. He had many warriors, who were called Fenians. He had a son, Oisin, who was a great warrior, too, and besides that a poet and a minstrel. Some of his poems are left to us yet. One day the Fenians were hunting, when they met a beautiful girl riding on a white horse. She called to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='other' adjectives='' verbs='go;call;speak' valence='5.955' arousal='3.955' dominance='5.7075'>Oisin</entity>, and he went apart from the others to speak with her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1024'>"She told him that she was the Princess of Tir-na-n-Oge, and that she had come to take him there, where she was to be married to him.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1025'>"He went back to his father and his companions and bade them farewell. It was with tears that Finn said good-by to Oisin, for I think he knew that he should never see him again. But Oisin did not know. Then Oisin mounted the white horse and set the Princess in front of him, and the horse galloped away toward the west. In a little while they came to the sea, and the horse kept straight on, galloping over the water as if it had been a smooth road. Then some say that the water rose around them and covered them and that they were in a beautiful place under the sea. I am not sure of that. Lands there are under <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tir-na-n-oge;doubt;land' adjectives='real;sure' verbs='be;say' valence='5.98272727273' arousal='3.71454545455' dominance='5.52818181818'>the sea</entity>, they say, and no doubt there are, but I am not so sure that the real Tir-na-n-Oge is there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1026'>"For others say that the tops of blue hills rose before them, and changed to green as they came nearer, and then Oisin saw that soft grass sloped down to the very water here and there, and in other places there were tall cliffs, and trailing vines hung down from the tops of them, covered with bright flowers, and they swung to and fro in the light breeze. Beyond there were more hills, covered with rich woods. Little veils of mist hid them partly and made them more beautiful, and streams poured down from high places and looked like thin, silky tassels hung upon the hills, and they waved in the air, like the waving vines, and some of them seemed never to reach the ground at all, but to blow away into fine silver spray and to mix with the mists of the hills. And golden sunlight poured down over it all, and there was a warm shimmer in the air that made it all look like something seen in a dream. And this was Tir-na-n-Oge.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1027'>"The horse came to the shore and galloped over soft turf till it seemed to Oisin that they were in the very middle of the island, and there they came to a palace, and Oisin thought that it was more beautiful than anything else that he had seen. It may be that the palace was built of marble, but to Oisin it seemed like blocks of pure snow. It was so long that one might well mount his horse to go the length of it, instead of walking. It had gilded domes that looked like suns, with the light shining on them, and the whole palace was dazzling to look at. All around it were gardens, with trees and plants in full bloom, of all the colors of the rainbow, and colors that are not in the rainbow, and other trees with only deep green leaves, and pathways among them which led down into cool, shady hollows, with clear brooks running through them between banks of soft, dark-green moss, sinking their quiet little song.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1028'>"Oisin got down off his horse and then lifted the Princess down, and they went into the palace. There the Princess"s father, the King of Tir-na-n-Oge, made Oisin welcome and led both of them to the banquet hall, where a great feast was spread in honor of the Princess and the new Prince.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1029'>"The next day the Princess was married to Oisin. For a long time Oisin and the Princess lived in the palace and Oisin thought that he never could be more happy than he was now. The old warriors cared much for what they ate and drank, and Oisin ate and drank better things than he had ever tasted before. He walked with the Princess down through the shady ways among the trees and across the brooks and up the hill-sides among the flowers. They sat together in the garden or in the palace and she sang to him and told him wonderful tales of heroes and of princesses of olden times. Sometimes they rode hunting together, and everywhere they found game, the finest that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='game;hunting' adjectives='finest' verbs='ride;see;find;have' valence='6.065' arousal='4.13333333333' dominance='5.80666666667'>Oisin</entity> had ever seen.</paragraph>

Then he said to the Princess: "Do not think that I am ungrateful for all the happiness that I have had here, but I am longing to see Erin again and to see my father and his men.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1034'>"So Oisin said no more then, but the great longing grew upon him, and every day the delights of Tir-na-n-Oge pleased him less. And at last he spoke of it again, and asked the Princess to let him go for a little while. "You would find Erin changed," she said, "and the Fenians are all gone.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1035'>""I cannot tell you to a day," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='country;people' adjectives='' verbs='answer;be;see;tell;know' valence='5.60071428571' arousal='4.02' dominance='5.42142857143'>Oisin</entity> answered, "but I know that it is weeks since I saw my country and my people."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1037'>"Oisin could not understand it, but he thought that if he could live so long and not know that the time had passed, the Fenians, too, might be living still, and he begged again to be allowed to go. At last the Princess saw that he would never be happy unless he went, so she brought him the same white horse that had brought them both to Tir-na-n-Oge. "The horse," she said, "will take you to Erin. But you must sit upon his back and never loose his bridle or get down upon the ground. If you touch the ground of Erin you will be at once a weak, old man, you can never come back to Tir-na-n-Oge, you will never see me, and I shall never see you again. Will you promise me, if I will let you go, that you will not get off the horse"s back or let go his bridle?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1038'>"Oisin promised and she let him go. Away over the water the horse galloped again. Tir-na-n-Oge, with its warm sun and its sweet air, was left behind. A damp sea-wind came up, and it blew the salt spray harshly into Oisin"s face as the horse dashed along. It was a joy to him. No more of the soft comforts of that weary island. This was something for a man to face. Yet he did not forget the Princess, and he meant to go back to her when he had seen his land and his people once more. Then the clouds and the fog drifted away and the sun shone out, but still the salt spray covered him, and he felt stronger as he made his way against it and felt the great, free breeze from the east. And now he saw something like a little cloud on the horizon, and it rose higher and grew wider, and then its misty brown faded away and he saw the beautiful green shores of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horizon;shore;something;cloud' adjectives='beautiful;misty;little;brown;green;wider;higher' verbs='see;rise;grow;fade' valence='5.85357142857' arousal='3.80142857143' dominance='5.21357142857'>Erin</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1039'>The old woman paused again and said over softly to herself: "The beautiful--beautiful green shores of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shore;woman' adjectives='beautiful;green;old' verbs='say;pause' valence='6.17571428571' arousal='4.39571428571' dominance='5.90857142857'>Erin</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1040'>"The horse and the rider soon reached the land now. Oisin rode first to the spot where he had first met the Princess of Tir-na-n-Oge and where he had last seen his father and his companions. He did not think to find them there, but he felt that it was the first place to which he should go. The forest had been cleared away a little, and a strange building stood there. It was a small house, built of stone, and there was a cross on the top of it. Inside he heard a sound of singing. He rode to the door and looked in. There were people kneeling before a man who stood in a higher place than the rest and held up a golden cup.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1041'>"This was something that Oisin did not understand, and he rode away, remembering what the Princess had told him, that he would find Ireland changed. He wondered if he had been wise to come at all. But he went on, and now he rode fast, in this direction and in that, to try to find the Fenians. Sometimes he asked people whom he met if they could tell him of his father. Some of them shook their heads and said that they knew no such person as Finn McCool. Others laughed at him. One or two old men told him that the Fenians had all died long ago and that the man of greatest power in Ireland now was Patrick. It was hard for him to believe. He would have thought himself in a dream, but a dream seems right and true while it lasts, and this seemed all wrong and false. Yet, when he found a place that he knew and looked for some familiar stronghold of the Fenians, he found only a low mound of earth, grown all over with grass, or perhaps with weeds and bushes. And everywhere he saw these houses of stone, with crosses on their tops.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1042'>"Then it came into his mind to find this Patrick of whom he heard so much, and to see what sort of man was now the greatest in Ireland. This was an easier matter than searching for the Fenians. Everyone knew where the holy Patrick was, and soon Oisin came near the place and found that the saint was building another of the stone houses. As Oisin came near he saw some men trying to lift a heavy stone upon a car, to take it to the new building. It almost made him laugh to see how small and weak the men were. He knew well that he could put the stone on the car alone. It was no larger than the stones that the Fenians used to throw for sport.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1043'>"He came near and leaned down from his saddle to lift the stone for the men. He took hold of it and began to raise it, but with the weight the girth of his saddle broke, the saddle slipped around on the horse, Oisin fell, and the horse ran away. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='man;ground' adjectives='blind;old;weak;white-haired;hollow-cheeked;wrinkled;helpless' verbs='forbid;touch;lay;have' valence='4.59692307692' arousal='4.30153846154' dominance='5.00461538462'>Oisin</entity> lay there on the ground of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='man;ground' adjectives='blind;old;weak;white-haired;hollow-cheeked;wrinkled;helpless' verbs='forbid;touch;lay;have' valence='4.59692307692' arousal='4.30153846154' dominance='5.00461538462'>Erin</entity>, which the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='man;ground' adjectives='blind;old;weak;white-haired;hollow-cheeked;wrinkled;helpless' verbs='forbid;touch;lay;have' valence='4.59692307692' arousal='4.30153846154' dominance='5.00461538462'>Princess</entity> had forbidden him to touch, an old man, weak, helpless, blind, hollow-cheeked, wrinkled, white-haired.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1044'>"The men took him up and carried him to St. Patrick, who welcomed him kindly and kept him for a while in his own house. Many times the saint talked with him and tried to make him a Christian, but Oisin could think of nothing but the grand days of the Fenians. When St. Patrick talked with him he would begin to tell of these, and he would make the poems about them that have been kept till now and give us what we know of Finn McCool and his heroes. And these poems Patrick would have written down. And always <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tir-na-n-oge' adjectives='old' verbs='be;seem;brave;mourn' valence='5.23285714286' arousal='3.89142857143' dominance='5.13'>Oisin</entity> was mourning for the brave old days of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tir-na-n-oge' adjectives='old' verbs='be;seem;brave;mourn' valence='5.23285714286' arousal='3.89142857143' dominance='5.13'>Finn McCool</entity> or for the days of Tir-na-n-Oge, which seemed to him now still farther off.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1045'>"Old as he was now, with the heavy weight of more than three hundred years upon him, blind and weak, there was one thing in which Oisin felt himself a better man that St. Patrick or any of his band. St. Patrick and all those who were with him fasted much, and when they ate it was frugally, of bread and the herbs of the field, and but little meat. But this was not enough for Oisin. He remembered how he and his fellow-huntsmen used to follow the deer and kill it, and dress it, and cook it on the moor in the fresh, cool evening, and feast till it was time to sleep, and then wake and follow the deer again. And so the food which was given to him in <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='food;house;s' adjectives='poor;scanty' verbs='be;seem;give' valence='6.10571428571' arousal='4.22142857143' dominance='5.32'>St. Patrick</entity>"s house seemed poor and scanty to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1046'>"He said this to the cook and others in the house, and they made sport of him, because so old a man as he should wish to eat so much. Then he told them tales of the days of his father, how great and strong the men of Erin were then, how much more fertile the land was, and of the great beasts and the great trees and plants and vines that it brought forth. In those days, he said, the leg of a lark was as large as a leg of mutton now, a berry of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sheep;mutton;leaf;shield;leg;berry;lark;ivy' adjectives='large;broad;ash' verbs='be;say' valence='5.6135' arousal='4.172' dominance='5.2925'>the wild</entity> ash was as large as a sheep, and an ivy leaf as broad as a shield.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1088'>The most natural thing in the world for Kathleen to do would have been to tell her grandmother about this and about all that Terence had said to her, but, whether it was because of the way that Terence had looked at her or for some other reason, she did not tell her.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1089'>Kathleen did not forget the promise which she had made to the other Terence in the hill, that she would come back. She had said that she would come back to-morrow if she could. But when to-morrow came, so many people who had heard that she was at home again came to see her, that she was not left alone for a moment. It was several days before she could get away from the house to go where she pleased alone. Then she went straight to the little pool in the Park.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1090'>If you live in New York, perhaps you would like to know just where this pool was--and still is. Well, then--go to the northwest corner of Central Park and go in by the little gate at the right of the carriage-drive. Then you will have to go down a flight of steps. Keep to the right, along the west side of the Park, and you will have to go only a few steps till you come to the pool, which is a little way up the bank, on the left, with the rocks behind it and the trees around it, as I have described it to you before. Then go back to the path and keep on the way that you were going, till you have gone up two short flights of steps. Then, only a few feet farther on, you will see, on the left, the little, shell-shaped, grassy slope where Kathleen danced with the Good People. Seeing these places will prove to you that this whole story is true.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1091'>Kathleen went straight to the pool, as I said, never thinking but that, when she got there, she could walk into the hill as easily as she had done before. But there was no opening at all in the rocks. They were just as they had always looked before she went through them with the Good People. Then she tried to step on the water, and instead of stepping on it she stepped into it and wet her foot. She almost concluded that everything had been a dream after all. She felt frightened about it, and she hurried home to look at the little box of green ointment. If she found it where she had left it, it would prove that she had really been inside the hill and that it was not a dream. She ran to her room to look for it, and there it was just as she had left it. It was not a dream.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1092'>But how was she to keep her promise to Terence?--the Hill Terence, she called him now, when she thought of him, so as not to confuse him with Terence Sullivan. She went to the pool again and again and tried to find the door in the rocks open and the water so that she could walk on it, but she never found them so. Yet she could not think of any other way to get into the hill again. After a while it seemed so hopeless that she gave up going to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='hopeless' verbs='go;seem;give' valence='5.58' arousal='4.30666666667' dominance='4.96833333333'>the pool</entity> so often.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1093'>Then one day a thought came to her which made it all seem so simple that she was quite surprised at herself for not thinking of it before. Terence had told her that he came out every day to go to school. He had said that the next year he was to go to the School of Engineering at the University. It was when she first came into the hill that he told her that, and so it was next year now. Now the University was not very far away, up on the hill, beyond the north end of the Park. She did not know whether there was any other way to get into the hill than this way through the rocks behind the pool, but if anybody were at the University and wanted to get into the hill, this would surely be the nearest way. Then she felt sure that if she went to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='time' adjectives='sure;right' verbs='feel;go;come;meet' valence='6.334' arousal='4.021' dominance='5.831'>the pool</entity> at the right time of the day she should meet <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time' adjectives='sure;right' verbs='feel;go;come;meet' valence='6.334' arousal='4.021' dominance='5.831'>Terence</entity> when he came out or when he went in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1094'>When she thought again she decided that she would not do anything of the kind. If Terence wanted to see her, it was his business to find her, not hers to find him. After that she thought still more. Terence had no way of finding her. She had never told him where she lived, and he might spend the rest of his life searching for her and never find her. And then she had promised him that she would come back. She had tried so hard to keep that promise already that most people would have said it was right for her to give it up now, but she had a feeling that a promise which she had made to Terence must be kept. She said to herself that it was because he had been so kind to her when she was in the hill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1095'>So she spent all the time she could near the pool, in the hope of seeing Terence. And what do you think happened? She did see him. One afternoon as she was walking along the same old path toward the gate at the corner of the Park, she saw Terence come through that gate and down the steps. And now you will never in the world guess what she did. I suppose you have believed this whole story till now, but I am afraid you will not believe this. I should not believe it myself, if I did not know that it was so. But there is no doubt about it. She turned and walked straight back along the path, and tried to get away without letting Terence see her. Don"t expect me to explain it. I don"t blame you for being surprised. It was the most wonderful thing I ever heard of. A sensible girl like <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='girl' adjectives='sensible' verbs='' valence='6.5825' arousal='4.5875' dominance='5.6375'>Kathleen</entity> too!</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1111'>Kathleen turned to look at it. "It is Venus," she said. Then she turned back toward where Terence had stood. He was gone. She looked up and down the path and all around, but she could not find him. She went up to the pool. The rocks were just as usual--just as close, just as hard. She tried the water again to see if she could stand on it. She could not. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;think' valence='6.596' arousal='4.136' dominance='5.886'>Terence</entity> was gone and she went home to think about it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1112'>She thought about it and she thought more about it, but she could not understand it at all. So she very sensibly gave up understanding it. She kept her promise and met Terence again near the pool. And then she met him again and a few times more. Every time he would make her look away from him for a moment, or wait till she did look away, and when she looked back he would be gone. It did not take her long to find out that he did not want her to see him go, of course, and so one day, when she turned her head away she turned it back again quickly, and saw him standing close to the pool with his face toward the rocks. She watched him for a moment while he stood there, and neither of them moved. Then he said, without looking around: "Let me go, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='t' adjectives='' verbs='go;re;say;let;look' valence='5.781' arousal='4.252' dominance='5.68'>Kathleen</entity>; I can"t go while you"re looking."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1113'>So she turned away for another instant, and when she looked again he was gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1114'>I don"t know how many times Terence and Kathleen strolled about the Park in this way, or what they talked about, or just how long a time went by, and I suppose that all these things interest you as little as they do me. But there is no doubt that one day, as they were walking together and talking together of whatever they found to talk about, they came face to face with Terence Sullivan. He passed them as if he had not seen them, but his face was black.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1115'>The next day he came to see Kathleen, and he said to her: "Do you think I don"t know who that was with you in the Park yesterday? And does your father know? He will, if I tell him, and what will he say, do you think, when he knows that you"re meeting that fine boy without his knowledge? If I see the two of you there again I"ll tell him, and I"ll be watching for you too. What do you say to that now?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1116'>"I say nothing to it," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing' adjectives='' verbs='answer;do;say;think' valence='5.74' arousal='4.26125' dominance='6.0625'>Kathleen</entity> answered; "what did you think I would say?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1117'>"What did I think you would say? What did I think you could say? Nothing, of course. And is that all you say?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1118'>"That is all," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;say' valence='6.045' arousal='3.93' dominance='6.19'>Kathleen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1119'>And that was all. He tried his best to get her to say more, but she would not. But it did not take her a minute to think what to do. And it was so simple that she wondered why she had never thought of it before. It was a wonder, too, that Terence Sullivan did not think of it himself and know that she would do it. But he was not clever in some ways, though he was so clever in others.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1120'>The next day Kathleen met Terence in the Park, and she said to him: "Terence, we must not stay here for a single minute. You must come straight home with me. I want you to see my father and my grandmother."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1121'>And Terence went straight home with her and she told her grandmother who he was--and indeed she had told her of him before--and that she had met him in the Park. Her father came soon and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='father' adjectives='' verbs='be;come;introduce' valence='6.1525' arousal='3.8075' dominance='5.8675'>Terence</entity> was introduced to him too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='1122'>After that Terence came often and Kathleen seldom met him in the Park, though they still walked there sometimes. Mrs. O"Brien and John were immensely pleased with him. It was the strangest thing to see how much he liked to be in a house, just because it was a house, and how wonderful the ways of people who lived in a house seemed to him. When he and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bottom;o;paper;book;mrs.;sight;time;corner;mermaid' adjectives='astonishing;same' verbs='be;play;sit;read;see;knit' valence='5.85666666667' arousal='3.90888888889' dominance='5.43444444444'>Kathleen</entity> sat together in a corner of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bottom;o;paper;book;mrs.;sight;time;corner;mermaid' adjectives='astonishing;same' verbs='be;play;sit;read;see;knit' valence='5.85666666667' arousal='3.90888888889' dominance='5.43444444444'>the room</entity> and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bottom;o;paper;book;mrs.;sight;time;corner;mermaid' adjectives='astonishing;same' verbs='be;play;sit;read;see;knit' valence='5.85666666667' arousal='3.90888888889' dominance='5.43444444444'>John</entity> sat reading a paper and Mrs. O"<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bottom;o;paper;book;mrs.;sight;time;corner;mermaid' adjectives='astonishing;same' verbs='be;play;sit;read;see;knit' valence='5.85666666667' arousal='3.90888888889' dominance='5.43444444444'>Brien</entity> knitting and reading a book at the same time, it was as astonishing a sight to him as it would be to you to see a dozen mermaids playing at the bottom of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bottom;o;paper;book;mrs.;sight;time;corner;mermaid' adjectives='astonishing;same' verbs='be;play;sit;read;see;knit' valence='5.85666666667' arousal='3.90888888889' dominance='5.43444444444'>the sea</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1125'>"The way you live here," Terence answered. "All these years, you know, I have just come out of the hill to go to school, and then I have gone back again. I have seen the people outside, but I never was in one of their houses before. And don"t you ever dance?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1126'>"Why, of course we do," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;ball;dancing;party' adjectives='' verbs='go;do;say;be' valence='6.19' arousal='4.325' dominance='5.90833333333'>Kathleen</entity> said; "we go to balls sometimes, and to parties where there is dancing, and then--"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1127'>"But do you never dance here, where you live?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1128'>"Oh, yes, sometimes we do, but the rooms are not large enough to do it very well, you know."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1129'>"I never thought before," said Terence, "of people"s not dancing all the time that they were not at work or eating or sleeping. You know there in the hill they dance a good deal of the time, and I get so tired of it that it seems to me as if they danced all the time. I think it is delightful not to dance. And what is your grandmother doing? Is she studying?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1130'>"Why, no, she is only reading."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1131'>"But what does she read, if she is not studying?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1132'>"Why, I don"t know; a story, maybe, or history, or poetry, or a sermon, or--it might be anything."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1133'>"Will you tell me about all those things some time?" Terence asked. "I have heard people tell stories, but I never read a story, and I never read anything except books to help me learn to make railways and telegraphs, so as to teach it to the people in the hill. That is all they think of when they are not dancing."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1134'>And Terence wondered like this at everything that he saw, and he often told Kathleen how tired he was of living in the hill and how much he wished that he could live outside among the real people, as he called them, instead of with the Good People. Once Kathleen tried to take Terence to see Peter and Ellen, and then a strange thing was discovered. Terence could not go there. When he came to the corner of the street where Peter and Ellen lived, he turned straight around and walked the other way. "This is <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;hurry;call' valence='5.47' arousal='3.566' dominance='5.144'>the way</entity>," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;hurry;call' valence='5.47' arousal='3.566' dominance='5.144'>Kathleen</entity> called, and she hurried back after him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1135'>When she came up with him he turned again and walked with her as they had been going at first. "I don"t know why I did that," he said. "I didn"t mean to. It was as if my feet turned me around and brought me back."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1136'>By this time they were at the corner again, and Terence did just the same thing over. He turned square around and walked back. He could not help it. He tried it again and again and he could not turn that corner. If you had been there and had seen him trying it, you would have thought that it was the funniest sight that you ever saw, though it may not sound so funny to tell about it. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rest;doorstep' adjectives='' verbs='be;have;want;sit;vex;laugh;go' valence='6.19333333333' arousal='4.16222222222' dominance='5.69666666667'>Kathleen</entity> was vexed that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rest;doorstep' adjectives='' verbs='be;have;want;sit;vex;laugh;go' valence='6.19333333333' arousal='4.16222222222' dominance='5.69666666667'>Terence</entity> could not go where she wanted him to, but she laughed till she had to sit down on a doorstep and rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1137'>Terence did not understand it any more than Kathleen did, and afterward he tried it again, but it was of no use. He begged her not to tell her father or her grandmother, because, he said, it would make him look so ridiculous. But one day, when he and Kathleen were on their way together to the O"Briens" house, as he came to the last corner, Terence turned around and walked away. "I can"t go home with you to-day," he said. "I don"t know why it is. I can"t walk that way. It is just the same as when I try to go to the Sullivans"."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1138'>He went back to the Park and Kathleen went home alone and found that Peter and Ellen were there. Then she simply could not keep herself from telling her grandmother all about it. Afterward she wished that she had not told her, for her grandmother laughed a little and nodded and looked as if she knew everything, and she would tell nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1139'>So the Hill Terence came to the O"Briens" so often that he felt quite at home, and everyone there was glad to have him come, and if he stayed away for as long as three or four days, they wondered what had become of him. And all this, you may suppose, did not improve Terence Sullivan"s temper. He and the Hill Terence never met except that one time in the Park, but he knew all about it. And he talked with Kathleen about it sometimes, too, and it made her very uncomfortable. He talked in the same way that he did the day after Kathleen came back from the hill, of his having something to do with the Hill Terence and of the harm that he could do if he chose. He never said anything that Kathleen could understand, but he always made her afraid. She told the Hill Terence about it, and she told her grandmother about it. Her grandmother seemed to understand it perfectly, and she told her not to be afraid. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='afraid' verbs='do;seem;understand;tell;be' valence='5.20666666667' arousal='3.80666666667' dominance='5.12333333333'>Terence</entity> did not seem to understand it at all, and he told her not to be afraid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1140'>Then one day, when Terence Sullivan had been talking to her in the same way and had been looking at her in a more terrible way than ever before, she told her grandmother that she could not bear it any longer. If something could not be done to make <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='father;something' adjectives='' verbs='be;look;do;make;stop;go;let;ask;talk' valence='6.01' arousal='3.678' dominance='5.832'>Terence</entity> stop talking to her so, and looking at her so, she should ask her father to let her go away somewhere.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1141'>"There"s nothing for you to be afraid of," her grandmother said, "but if you are afraid and if it troubles you so much, we will see what we can do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1142'>Then Mrs. O"Brien went to her own room and came back with something which she gave to Kathleen. It was a little crucifix, made of iron. "It was this," she said, "that I touched you with to bring you out of the circle when you were dancing with the Good People. Hang it around your neck, and if Terence troubles you, hold it up before you and before him. I have always said that Terence was one of the Good People, and I never believed it more than this minute. If he is one of them, he cannot come near the cross, and the iron will be a terror to him too. If he tries to come too near to you, touch him with it, and then we"ll see."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1143'>"Why can he not come near the cross?" <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.95' arousal='3.48' dominance='6.29'>Kathleen</entity> asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1144'>"Because," Mrs. O"Brien said, "the Good People are a kind of spirits, and no spirits can do you any harm if you hold the cross before you, or if you make the sign of the cross. Did I never tell you what the Good People were? They were angels and lived in Heaven once. When Satan and his angels rebelled against God and were driven out of Heaven, the angels that are the Good People were driven out too. They were not good enough to stay in Heaven, and they were not bad enough to fall as Satan and his angels fell, so some of them stayed on the land and some of them stayed in the sea. And so they will live till the Day of Judgment, and then, some say, they will vanish like dew when it dries away; and some say that they will be saved like the souls of Christians. But we do not know."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1145'>"You do not know," Kathleen repeated, "if the Good People will be saved or not? They were very good to me, though they kept me away from home so long, and I should like to believe--"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1146'>"I have read of one of them," Mrs. O"Brien went on, "who looked in at the gate of Heaven, and an angel told him that he could come in, if he could bring with him the thing which was counted in Heaven the most precious in all the world. And he found it and brought it and went into Heaven. But for the most of them--the Good People themselves do not know whether they are to be saved, and we common people do not know, but they say that priests know. And sometimes the Good People themselves have tried to find out from them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1147'>"There was a troupe of fairies dancing one night on a green near a river, and they were all having the merry kind of time that you know better than I do, Kathleen. But they stopped all at once and ran to hide themselves among the grass and behind leaves and weeds. For they knew, in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='priest;people' adjectives='good' verbs='bear;be;come;know;have' valence='5.84933333333' arousal='3.728' dominance='5.502'>the way</entity> that they have of knowing, that a priest was coming, and the Good People cannot bear to be near a priest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1148'>"The priest who was coming had been on some errand at a long distance from home, and he was a long way from home still. Indeed, he was just making up his mind that, as it was so late, he would not try to go home at all that night, but would ask for a supper and a bed at the first cabin he should come to. And well he knew he would find it and welcome.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1149'>"And true for him, close by where the Good People had been dancing, he came to a cabin and knocked at the door. The man and his wife who lived there were proud enough to see the priest in their house and to give him all that he asked, and the trouble that was on them was that they had no more to give. For there was nothing to offer him but potatoes, though they were as good potatoes as there were in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;potato' adjectives='good' verbs='be;offer' valence='6.33142857143' arousal='3.33571428571' dominance='5.75'>Ireland</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1150'>"It was only a little while ago that the man of the house had set a net in the river, and he thought that there would hardly be a fish in it so soon. But then he thought that there could be no harm in looking, so down to the river he went to try could he find something for the priest"s supper more than the potatoes. And true enough, there in the net was the finest salmon he ever saw. He was about to take him out, when the net was pulled away from him by something that he could not see, and away went the salmon swimming down <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='net;salmon;something' adjectives='' verbs='swim;be;pull;see;take;go' valence='6.076' arousal='4.046' dominance='5.33'>the river</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1151'>"It may be that he said things to the fish that I wouldn"t like to be saying after him, and at the same time he looked around to see what it was that was pulling his net. And then he saw the Good People.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1152'>""Give yourself no trouble about the fish," one of them said to him. "If you"ll only go back to your house and ask the priest one question from us we"ll see that he and you have the finest supper that was ever seen."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1153'>"Now the man thought that it was not safe to be talking and making bargains with the Good People, so he said: "I"ll not have anything to do with you at all." And then he thought neither was it safe to make them angry with him, and so he said again: "I"ve no wish to offend you and I thank you for your offer, but I can"t take it from you, and I don"t think his Reverence would like me to do that same."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1154'>"Then the one that had spoken first said: "We"ll not ask you to take anything you don"t want, but will you ask the priest one question for us?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1155'>""I see no harm in that," said he, "for sure he needn"t answer it if he doesn"t like; but I"ll not take your supper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1156'>""Then," said the little man, "ask him if we are to be saved at the Day of Judgment, like the souls of Christians, and bring us back word what he says, and we"ll be grateful to you forever."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1157'>"He went back to his cabin and found his wife and the priest sitting down to supper. "Your Reverence," said he, "might I ask you one question?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1158'>""And what might that be?" said the priest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1159'>""Will you tell me," said he "will the Good People be saved at the Day of Judgment, the same as Christians?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1160'>""You never thought of asking that yourself," the priest said; "who told you to ask it?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1162'>""Go and tell them, then," said the priest, "that if they will come here and ask me that or any other question themselves, I will answer them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1163'>"So he went back and told them what the priest said, and the instant they heard it they all flew away over the grass and up into the air and vanished. Then he went back to eat his potatoes with the priest, still feeling sorry that he had lost the salmon."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1164'>"But still I don"t see," Kathleen said. "You say that the cross will help me against Terence if he is one of the Good People, because they are a kind of spirits. But why wouldn"t it help me against him just as much if he wasn"t one of the Good People--if he was just a bad man?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1165'>"No, no," said the old woman; "that little bit of iron will keep you against any evil spirit, and never one of them dare come near it; but no poor human creature with a soul to save, no matter how wicked, was ever turned away from the blessed cross, or ever will be. The cross was made for them. And now, dear, you have been crying and your eyes are all red. Go to your room and try to make them look better. There might be someone to see you before long, and you wouldn"t like your eyes to look that way."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1166'>Someone did come to see <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grandmother;someone' adjectives='' verbs='do;see;come;happen;stay' valence='6.12142857143' arousal='3.62285714286' dominance='5.97857142857'>Kathleen</entity> before long, but, as it happened, neither she nor her grandmother stayed to see him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1167'>Kathleen scarcely knew that she had been crying till her grandmother told her, but she had. She went to her room and looked in the glass and was surprised to see how red her eyes were. And just at the same instant she saw the little gold box of green ointment, just under the glass, where she had left it, and where it had been ever since that night when she came back from the hill. Then she remembered how the Fairy Queen had given it to her to put on the little Prince"s eyes, and how she had done it, and how bright his eyes looked when she touched them with the ointment. She wondered if it would make her eyes look bright, too, and take the marks of the tears away from them. She took a tiny bit of the ointment on her finger and just touched each eye with it. It did make them look brighter; there was no doubt about it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1168'>The next instant Kathleen started away from the mirror and across the room with a little frightened gasp. For, looking in the glass, she had seen a dark form pass behind her, as if it had just come in at the door of the room. She knew who it was without turning around. It was Terence Sullivan. He was still close to the door now, and she was across the room. She had the little iron crucifix in her hand and she turned and faced him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1169'>"What are you doing here?" she said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1170'>Terence only stared at her, for an instant, more surprised than she was herself. Then he stammered: "What--what am I--"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1171'>"What are you here for?" said Kathleen. "Why do you follow me like this? I won"t let you. Go away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1172'>Terence was a little more himself now. "Which eye do you see me with?" he cried.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1175'>She raised her hand quickly to ward off the blow, and Terence"s hand touched the iron crucifix. The blow did not reach her eyes. Terence started back from her and fell upon the floor. Only for an instant Kathleen saw his face. His eyes blazed, but the rest of it was as if he had been dead. Somehow he found his way out of the room, Kathleen could scarcely see how. He did not rise, but he seemed to run like a beast running for its life. Kathleen followed him out of the room and to the stairs. She saw him just leaving the house by the door. And yet she could not see how he went, for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;see;shut' valence='5.74' arousal='3.886' dominance='5.708'>the door</entity> was shut.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1176'>Kathleen ran downstairs to find her grandmother and to tell her what had happened. Mrs. O"Brien listened and then she said: "Kathleen, you have been thinking too much about Terence and you have got too nervous.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1177'>"But I saw him, grandmother," Kathleen answered, "and it was all just as I told you. How could I see him if he did not come?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1178'>Mrs. O"Brien sat and thought for a few minutes. "What did you do before you saw Terence?" she asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1179'>Kathleen thought for a minute, too, for she was so much excited that she could scarcely remember. "I had been crying," she said, "as you told me, and I put some of the ointment in the little gold box on my eyes to see if it would make them look better."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1180'>"It was that," said Mrs. O"Brien. "I"ve heard the like of it before. When you have touched your eyes with that ointment you can always see the Good People, whether they want you to or not. That was why he tried to strike your eyes, and if he had struck them he would have put them out. You will always see the Good People now wherever you meet them. They don"t like to be seen except when they choose, and so they may try to do you harm, and you must be careful. Keep the little cross always by you.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1181'>"And now come with me," the old woman went on. "I have had enough of this, and I will have no more."</paragraph>

I cared nothing for her. It was only the soul that I"ld get from her that I wanted. And this time it was only the soul that I wanted, too, at first, but I loved this one in the end. But a soul will always find out another soul, and there"s nothing for one like us, that has no soul. Oh, I couldn"t even tell her like a man. All I could do was to be always frightening her and threatening her, and I knew all the time that it would drive her away from me at last, or me away from her. And I"ll be like the rest of you till the Last Day, and then it"s not even a little smoke that there"ll be left of us. Dance and play and do what you like, but leave me be."</paragraph>

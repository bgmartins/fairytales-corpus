	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='11'>The stories in this Fairy Book come from all quarters of the world. For example, the adventures of "Ball-Carrier and the Bad One" are told by Red Indian grandmothers to Red Indian children who never go to school, nor see pen and ink. "The Bunyip" is known to even more uneducated little ones, running about with no clothes at all in the bush, in Australia. You may see photographs of these merry little black fellows before their troubles begin, in "Northern Races of Central Australia," by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. They have no lessons except in tracking and catching birds, beasts, fishes, lizards, and snakes, all of which they eat. But when they grow up to be big boys and girls, they are cruelly cut about with stone knives and frightened with sham bogies all for their good" their parents say and I think they would rather go to school, if they had their choice, and take their chance of being birched and bullied. However, many boys might think it better fun to begin to learn hunting as soon as they can walk. Other stories, like "The Sacred Milk of Koumongoe," come from the Kaffirs in Africa, whose dear papas are not so poor as those in Australia, but have plenty of cattle and milk, and good mealies to eat, and live in houses like very big bee-hives, and wear clothes of a sort, though not very like our own. "Pivi and Kabo" is a tale from the brown people in the island of New Caledonia, where a boy is never allowed to speak to or even look at his own sisters; nobody knows why, so curious are the manners of this remote island. The story shows the advantages of good manners and pleasant behaviour; and the natives do not now cook and eat each other, but live on fish, vegetables, pork, and chickens, and dwell in houses. "What the Rose did to the Cypress," is a story from Persia, where the people, of course, are civilised, and much like those of whom you read in "The Arabian Nights." Then there are tales like "The Fox and the Lapp" from the very north of Europe, where it is dark for half the year and day-light for the other half. The Lapps are a people not fond of soap and water, and very much given to art magic. Then there are tales from India, told to Major Campbell, who wrote them out, by Hindoos; these stories are "Wali Dad the Simple-hearted," and "The King who would be Stronger than Fate," but was not so clever as his daughter. From Brazil, in South America, comes "The Tortoise and the Mischievous Monkey," with the adventures of other animals. Other tales are told in various parts of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sort;beast;story;grub;language;people;crow;skin;school;hand;tale;thing;lizard;part;black;child;nothing;serpent;hawk;clothes' adjectives='brown;little;many;yellow;other;various;same;black;white;red' verbs='be;live;wear;go;tell;mean' valence='5.77609756098' arousal='3.98243902439' dominance='5.5112195122'>Europe</entity>, and in many languages; but all people, black, white, brown, red, and yellow, are like each other when they tell stories; for these are meant for children, who like the same sort of thing, whether they go to school and wear clothes, or, on the other hand, wear skins of beasts, or even nothing at all, and live on grubs and lizards and hawks and crows and serpents, like the little Australian blacks.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='12'>The tale of "What the Rose did to the Cypress," is translated out of a Persian manuscript by Mrs. Beveridge. "Pivi and Kabo" is translated by the Editor from a French version; "Asmund and Signy" by Miss Blackley; the Indian stories by Major Campbell, and all the rest are told by Mrs. Lang, who does not give them exactly as they are told by all sorts of outlandish natives, but makes them up in the hope white people will like them, skipping the pieces which they will not like.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>Once upon a time a great king of the East, named Saman-lalposh, [2] had three brave and clever sons--Tahmasp, Qamas, and Almas-ruh-baksh. [3] One day, when the king was sitting in his hall of audience, his eldest son, Prince Tahmasp, came before him, and after greeting his father with due respect, said: "O my royal father! I am tired of the town; if you will give me leave, I will take my servants to-morrow and will go into the country and hunt on the hill-skirts; and when I have taken some game I will come back, at evening-prayer time." His father consented, and sent with him some of his own trusted servants, and also hawks, and falcons, hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>At the place where the prince intended to hunt he saw a most beautiful deer. He ordered that it should not be killed, but trapped or captured with a noose. The deer looked about for a place where he might escape from the ring of the beaters, and spied one unwatched close to the prince himself. It bounded high and leaped right over his head, got out of the ring, and tore like the eastern wind into the waste. The prince put spurs to his horse and pursued it; and was soon lost to the sight of his followers. Until the world-lighting sun stood above his head in the zenith he did not take his eyes off the deer; suddenly it disappeared behind some rising ground, and with all his search he could not find any further trace of it. He was now drenched in sweat, and he breathed with pain; and his horse"s tongue hung from its mouth with thirst. He dismounted and toiled on, with bridle on arm, praying and casting himself on the mercy of heaven. Then his horse fell and surrendered its life to God. On and on he went across the sandy waste, weeping and with burning breast, till at length a hill rose into sight. He mustered his strength and climbed to the top, and there he found a giant tree whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth, and whose crest touched the very heaven. Its branches had put forth a glory of leaves, and there were grass and a spring underneath it, and flowers of many colours.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>Gladdened by this sight, he dragged himself to the water"s edge, drank his fill, and returned thanks for his deliverance from thirst.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='59'>He looked about him and, to his amazement, saw close by a royal seat. While he was pondering what could have brought this into the merciless desert, a man drew near who was dressed like a faqir, and had bare head and feet, but walked with the free carriage of a person of rank. His face was kind, and wise and thoughtful, and he came on and spoke to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='face' adjectives='thoughtful;wise' verbs='be;come;speak' valence='6.49875' arousal='3.89125' dominance='6.0975'>the prince</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>"O good youth! how did you come here? Who are you? Where do you come from?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>The prince told everything just as it had happened to him, and then respectfully added: "I have made known my own circumstances to you, and now I venture to beg you to tell me your own. Who are you? How did you come to make your dwelling in this wilderness?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='62'>To this the faqir replied: "O youth! it would be best for you to have nothing to do with me and to know nothing of my fortunes, for my story is fit neither for telling nor for hearing." <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing' adjectives='hard;last' verbs='be;do;hear;plead;let;tell' valence='5.49' arousal='3.812' dominance='5.333'>The prince</entity>, however, pleaded so hard to be told, that at last there was nothing to be done but to let him hear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>"Learn and know, O young man! that I am King Janangir [4] of Babylon, and that once I had army and servants, family and treasure; untold wealth and belongings. The Most High God gave me seven sons who grew up well versed in all princely arts. My eldest son heard from travellers that in Turkistan, on the Chinese frontier, there is a king named Quimus, the son of Timus, and that he has an only child, a daughter named Mihr-afruz, [5] who, under all the azure heaven, is unrivalled for beauty. Princes come from all quarters to ask her hand, and on one and all she imposes a condition. She says to them: "I know a riddle; and I will marry anyone who answers it, and will bestow on him all my possessions. But if a suitor cannot answer my question I cut off his head and hang it on the battlements of the citadel." The riddle she asks is, "What did the rose do to the cypress?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>"Now, when my son heard this tale, he fell in love with that unseen girl, and he came to me lamenting and bewailing himself. Nothing that I could say had the slightest effect on him. I said: "Oh my son! if there must be fruit of this fancy of yours, I will lead forth a great army against King Quimus. If he will give you his daughter freely, well and good; and if not, I will ravage his kingdom and bring her away by force." This plan did not please him; he said: "It is not right to lay a kingdom waste and to destroy a palace so that I may attain my desire. I will go alone; I will answer the riddle, and win her in this way." At last, out of pity for him, I let him go. He reached the city of King Quimus. He was asked the riddle and could not give the true answer; and his head was cut off and hung upon the battlements. Then I mourned him in black raiment for forty days.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>After this another and another of my sons were seized by the same desire, and in the end all my seven sons went, and all were killed. In grief for their death I have abandoned my throne, and I abide here in this desert, withholding my hand from all State business and wearing myself away in sorrow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='66'>Prince Tahmasp listened to this tale, and then the arrow of love for that unseen girl struck his heart also. Just at this moment of his ill-fate his people came up, and gathered round him like moths round a light. They brought him a horse, fleet as the breeze of the dawn; he set his willing foot in the stirrup of safety and rode off. As the days went by the thorn of love rankled in his heart, and he became the very example of lovers, and grew faint and feeble. At last his confidants searched his heart and lifted the veil from the face of his love, and then set the matter before his father, King Saman-lal-posh. "Your son, Prince Tahmasp, loves distractedly the Princess Mihr-afruz, daughter of King Quimus, son of Timus." Then they told the king all about her and her doings. A mist of sadness clouded the king"s mind, and he said to his son: "If this thing is so, I will in the first place send a courier with friendly letters to King Quimus, and will ask the hand of his daughter for you. I will send an abundance of gifts, and a string of camels laden with flashing stones and rubies of Badakhsham In this way I will bring her and her suite, and I will give her to you to be your solace. But if King Quimus is unwilling to give her to you, I will pour a whirlwind of soldiers upon him, and I will bring to you, in this way, that most consequential of girls." But the prince said that this plan would not be right, and that he would go himself, and would answer the riddle. Then the king"s wise men said: "This is a very weighty matter; it would be best to allow the prince to set out accompanied by some persons in whom you have confidence. Maybe he will repent and come back." So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='leave;stuff;string;gold;camel;courtier;jewel;preparation;journey' adjectives='raven-eyed;costly;two-humped;laden' verbs='be;set;accompany;make;take;order' valence='5.53578947368' arousal='4.14210526316' dominance='5.49210526316'>King Saman</entity> ordered all preparations for the journey to be made, and then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='leave;stuff;string;gold;camel;courtier;jewel;preparation;journey' adjectives='raven-eyed;costly;two-humped;laden' verbs='be;set;accompany;make;take;order' valence='5.53578947368' arousal='4.14210526316' dominance='5.49210526316'>Prince Tahmasp</entity> took his leave and set out, accompanied by some of the courtiers, and taking with him a string of two-humped and raven-eyed camels laden with jewels, and gold, and costly stuffs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='67'>By stage after stage, and after many days" journeying, he arrived at the city of King Quimus. What did he see? A towering citadel whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth, and whose battlements touched the blue heaven. He saw hanging from its battlements many heads, but it had not the least effect upon him that these were heads of men of rank; he listened to no advice about laying aside his fancy, but rode up to the gate and on into the heart of the city. The place was so splendid that the eyes of the ages have never seen its like, and there, in an open square, he found a tent of crimson satin set up, and beneath it two jewelled drums with jewelled sticks. These drums were put there so that the suitors of the princess might announce their arrival by beating on them, after which some one would come and take them to the king"s presence. The sight of the drums stirred the fire of Prince Tahmasp"s love. He dismounted, and moved towards them; but his companions hurried after and begged him first to let them go and announce him to the king, and said that then, when they had put their possessions in a place of security, they would enter into the all important matter of the princess. The prince, however, replied that he was there for one thing only; that his first duty was to beat the drums and announce himself as a suitor, when he would be taken, as such, to the king, who would then give him proper lodgment. So he struck upon the drums, and at once summoned an officer who took him to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='drum;officer;quimus' adjectives='' verbs='strike;take;summon' valence='5.06' arousal='4.74428571429' dominance='4.96285714286'>King</entity> Quimus.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='68'>When the king saw how very young the prince looked, and that he was still drinking of the fountain of wonder, he said: "O youth! leave aside this fancy which my daughter has conceived in the pride of her beauty. No one can answer er her riddle, and she has done to death many men who had had no pleasure in life nor tasted its charms. God forbid that your spring also should be ravaged by the autumn winds of martyrdom." All his urgency, however, had no effect in making the prince withdraw. At length it was settled between them that three days should be given to pleasant hospitality and that then should follow what had to be said and done. Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='station;quarter' adjectives='own' verbs='go;be;treat;become' valence='6.03' arousal='4.10285714286' dominance='5.53'>the prince</entity> went to his own quarters and was treated as became his station.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>King Quimus now sent for his daughter and for her mother, Gulrukh, [6] and talked to them. He said to Mibrafruz: "Listen to me, you cruel flirt! Why do you persist in this folly? Now there has come to ask your hand a prince of the east, so handsome that the very sun grows modest before the splendour of his face; he is rich, and he has brought gold and jewels, all for you, if you will marry him. A better husband you will not find."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>But all the arguments of father and mother were wasted, for her only answer was: "O my father! I have sworn to myself that I will not marry, even if a thousand years go by, unless someone answers my riddle, and that I will give myself to that man only who does answer it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='71'>The three days passed; then the riddle was asked: "What did the rose do to the cypress?" <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hesitation;knowledge;secret;hair;verse;tongue;man;omnipotent' adjectives='eloquent' verbs='do;say;split;have;reply;believe;know' valence='5.73' arousal='4.24' dominance='5.80333333333'>The prince</entity> had an eloquent tongue, which could split a hair, and without hesitation he replied to her with a verse: "Only the Omnipotent has knowledge of secrets; if any man says, "I know" do not believe him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='72'>Then a servant fetched in the polluted, blue-eyed headsman, who asked: "Whose sun of life has come near its setting?" took <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;head;battlements;cloth;hearted;execution;arm' adjectives='stony;merciless' verbs='hang;cut;place;take' valence='4.72357142857' arousal='4.455' dominance='5.19785714286'>the prince</entity> by the arm, placed him upon the cloth of execution, and then, all merciless and stony hearted, cut his head from his body and hung it on the battlements.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>The news of the death of Prince Tahmasp plunged his father into despair and stupefaction. He mourned for him in black raiment for forty days; and then, a few days later, his second son, Prince Qamas, extracted from him leave to go too; and he, also, was put to death. One son only now remained, the brave, eloquent, happy-natured Prince Almas-ruh-bakhsh. One day, when his father sat brooding over his lost children, Almas came before him and said: "O father mine! the daughter of King Quimus has done my two brothers to death; I wish to avenge them upon her." These words brought his father to tears. "O light of your father!" he cried, "I have no one left but you, and now you ask me to let you go to your death."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='74'>"Dear father!" pleaded <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='foot;pride;beauty' adjectives='' verbs='lower;set;sit;settle;have;plead' valence='5.55846153846' arousal='4.04153846154' dominance='5.47076923077'>the prince</entity>, "until I have lowered the pride of that beauty, and have set her here before you, I cannot settle down or indeed sit down off my feet."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='75'>In the end he, too, got leave to go; but he went a without a following and alone. Like his brothers, he made the long journey to the city of Quimus the son of Timus; like them he saw the citadel, but he saw there the heads of Tahmasp and Qamas. He went about in the city, saw the tent and the drums, and then went out again to a village not far off. Here he found out a very old man who had a wife 120 years old, or rather more. Their lives were coming to their end, but they had never beheld face of child of their own. They were glad when the prince came to their house, and they dealt with him as with a son. He put all his belongings into their charge, and fastened his horse in their out-house. Then he asked them not to speak of him to anyone, and to keep his affairs secret. He exchanged his royal dress for another, and next morning, just as the sun looked forth from its eastern oratory, he went again into the city. He turned over in his mind without ceasing how he was to find out the meaning of the riddle, and to give them a right answer, and who could help him, and how to avenge his brothers. He wandered about <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;riddle;land;service;mihr-afruz' adjectives='' verbs='understand;be;hear;wander' valence='6.503' arousal='3.763' dominance='5.597'>the city</entity>, but heard nothing of service, for there was no one in all that land who understood the riddle of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;riddle;land;service;mihr-afruz' adjectives='' verbs='understand;be;hear;wander' valence='6.503' arousal='3.763' dominance='5.597'>Princess</entity> Mihr-afruz.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>One day he thought he would go to her own palace and see if he could learn anything there, so he went out to her garden-house. It was a very splendid place, with a wonderful gateway, and walls like Alexander"s ramparts. Many gate-keepers were on guard, and there was no chance of passing them. His heart was full of bitterness, but he said to himself: "All will be well! it is here I shall get what I want." He went round outside the garden wall hoping to find a gap, and he made supplication in the Court of Supplications and prayed, "O Holder of the hand of the helpless! show me my way."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='77'>While he prayed he bethought himself that he could get into the garden with a stream of inflowing water. He looked carefully round, fearing to be seen, stripped, slid into the stream and was carried within the great walls. There he hid himself till his loin cloth was dry. The garden was a very Eden, with running water amongst its lawns, with flowers and the lament of doves and the jug-jug of nightingales. It was a place to steal the senses from the brain, and he wandered about and saw the house, but there seemed to be no one there. In the forecourt was a royal seat of polished jasper, and in the middle of the platform was a basin of purest water that flashed like a mirror. He pleased himself with these sights for a while, and then went back to the garden and hid himself from the gardeners and passed the night. Next morning he put on the appearance of a madman and wandered about till he came to a lawn where several pert-faced girls were amusing themselves. On a throne, jewelled and overspread with silken stuffs, sat a girl the splendour of whose beauty lighted up the place, and whose ambergris and attar perfumed the whole air. "That must be Mihrafruz," he thought, "she is indeed lovely." Just then one of the attendants came to the water"s edge to fill a cup, and though the prince was in hiding, his face was reflected in the water. When she saw this image she was frightened, and let her cup fall into the stream, and thought, "Is it an angel, or a peri, or a man?" Fear and trembling took hold of her, and she screamed as women scream.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='78'>"O princess! I went for water, and I saw an image, and I was afraid." So another girl went to the water and saw the same thing, and came back with the same story. The princess wished to see for herself; she rose and paced to the spot with the march of a prancing peacock. When she saw the image she said to her nurse: "Find out who is reflected in the water, and where he lives." Her words reached the prince"s ear, he lifted up his head; she saw him and beheld beauty such as she had never seen before. She lost a hundred hearts to him, and signed to her nurse to bring him to her presence. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;nurse;mind;garden;man' adjectives='civil;mixed;random;hungry;rude' verbs='be;get;cry;question;misplace;say;persuade;let;behave;have;go;smile' valence='5.67964285714' arousal='4.26964285714' dominance='5.51785714286'>The prince</entity> let himself be persuaded to go with the nurse, but when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;nurse;mind;garden;man' adjectives='civil;mixed;random;hungry;rude' verbs='be;get;cry;question;misplace;say;persuade;let;behave;have;go;smile' valence='5.67964285714' arousal='4.26964285714' dominance='5.51785714286'>the princess</entity> questioned him as to who he was and how he had got into her garden, he behaved like a man out of his mind--sometimes smiling, sometimes crying, and saying: "I am hungry,"Or words misplaced and random, civil mixed with the rude.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='79'>"What a pity!" said the princess, "he is mad!" As she liked him she said: "He is my madman; let no one hurt him." She took him to her house and told him not to go away, for that she would provide for all his wants. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='riddle;death;pain;house;thought;answer' adjectives='very;silent;excellent' verbs='be;get' valence='5.511875' arousal='4.39625' dominance='5.3525'>The prince</entity> thought, "It would be excellent if here, in her very house, I could get the answer to her riddle; but I must be silent, on pain of death."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>Now in the princess"s household there was a girl called Dil-aram [7]; she it was who had first seen the image of the prince. She came to love him very much, and she spent day and night thinking how she could make her affection known to him. One day she escaped from the princess"s notice and went to the prince, and laid her head on his feet and said: "Heaven has bestowed on you beauty and charm. Tell me your secret; who are you, and how did you come here? I love you very much, and if you would like to leave this place I will go with you. I have wealth equal to the treasure of the miserly Qarun." But the prince only made answer like a man distraught, and told her nothing. He said to himself, "God forbid that the veil should be taken in vain from my secret; that would indeed disgrace me." So, with streaming eyes and burning breast, Dil-aram arose and went to her house and lamented and fretted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>Now whenever the princess commanded the prince"s attendance, Dil-aram, of all the girls, paid him attention and waited on him best. The princess noticed this, and said: "O Dil-aram! you must take my madman into your charge and give him whatever he wants." This was the very thing Dilaram had prayed for. A little later she took the prince into a private place and she made him take an oath of secrecy, and she herself took one and swore, "By Heaven! I will not tell your secret. Tell me all about yourself so that I may help you to get what you want." The prince now recognised in her words the perfume of true love, and he made compact with her. "O lovely girl! I want to know what the rose did to the cypress. Your mistress cuts off men"s heads because of this riddle; what is at the bottom of it, and why does she do it?" Then Dil-aram answered: "If you will promise to marry me and to keep me always amongst those you favour, I will tell you all I know, and I will keep watch about the riddle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>"O lovely girl," rejoined he, "if I accomplish my purpose, so that I need no longer strive for it, I will keep my compact with you. When I have this woman in my power and have avenged my brothers, I will make you my solace."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>"O wealth of my life and source of my joy!" responded Dil-aram, "I do not know what the rose did to the cypress; but so much I know that the person who told Mihr-afruz about it is a negro whom she hides under her throne. He fled here from Waq of the Caucasus--it is there you must make inquiry; there is no other way of getting at the truth."On hearing these words, the prince said to his heart, "O my heart! your task will yet wear away much of your life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>He fell into long and far thought, and Dil-aram looked at him and said: "O my life and my soul! do not be sad. If you would like this woman killed, I will put poison into her cup so that she will never lift her head from her drugged sleep again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"O Dil-aram! such a vengeance is not manly. I shall not rest till I have gone to Waq of the Caucasus and have cleared up the matter." Then they repeated the agreement about their marriage, and bade one another goodbye.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>The prince had not the least knowledge of the way to Waq of the Caucasus, and was cast down by the sense of his helplessness. He was walking along by his horse"s side when there appeared before him an old man of serene countenance, dressed in green and carrying a staff, who resembled Khizr. [8] The prince thanked heaven, laid the hands of reverence on his breast and salaamed. The old man returned the greeting graciously, and asked: "How fare you? Whither are you bound? You look like a traveller."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>"O revered saint! I am in this difficulty: I do not know the way to Waq of the Caucasus." The old man of good counsel looked at the young prince and said: "Turn back from this dangerous undertaking. Do not go; choose some other task! If you had a hundred lives you would not bring one out safe from this journey." But his words had no effect on the prince"s resolve. "What object have you," the old man asked, "in thus consuming your life?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='90'>When the saint saw that the prince was not to be moved, he said: "Learn and know, O youth! that Waq of Qaf is in the Caucasus and is a dependency of it.

Then you will come to a column on which is a marble slab inscribed with Cufic characters. Do what is written there; beware of disobedience."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>After a day and a night he saw the column rise in silent beauty to the heavens. Everything was as the wise old man had said it would be, and the prince, who was skilled in all tongues, read the following Cufic inscription: "O travellers! be it known to you that this column has been set up with its tablet to give true directions about these roads. If a man would pass his life in ease and pleasantness, let him take the right-hand path. If he take the left, he will have some trouble, but he will reach his goal without much delay. Woe to him who chooses the middle path! if he had a thousand lives he would not save one; it is very hazardous; it leads to the Caucasus, and is an endless road. Beware of it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>The prince read and bared his head and lifted his hands in supplication to Him who has no needs, and prayed, "O Friend of the traveller! I, Thy servant, come to Thee for succour. My purpose lies in the land of Qaf and my road is full of peril. Lead me by it." Then he took a handful of earth and cast it on his collar, and said: "O earth! be thou my grave; and O vest! tee thou my winding-sheet!" Then he took the middle road and went along it, day after day, with many a silent prayer, till he saw trees rise from the weary waste of sand. They grew in a garden, and he went up to the gate and found it a slab of beautifully worked marble, and that near it there lay sleeping, with his head on a stone, a negro whose face was so black that it made darkness round him. His upper lip, arched like an eyebrow, curved upwards to his nostrils and his lower hung down like a camel"s. Four millstones formed his shield, and on a box-tree close by hung his giant sword. His loin-cloth was fashioned of twelve skins of beasts, and was bound round his waist by a chain of which each link was as big as an elephant"s thigh.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>The prince approached and tied up his horse near the negro"s head. Then he let fall the Bismillah from his lips, entered the garden and walked through it till he came to the private part, delighting in the great trees, the lovely verdure, and the flowery borders. In the inner garden there were very many deer. These signed to him with eye and foot to go back, for that this was enchanted ground; but he did not understand them, and thought their pretty gestures were a welcome. After a while he reached a palace which had a porch more splendid than Caesar"s, and was built of gold and silver bricks. In its midst was a high seat, overlaid with fine carpets, and into it opened eight doors, each having opposite to it a marble basin.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='94'>Banishing care, Prince Almas walked on through the garden, when suddenly a window opened and a girl, who was lovely enough to make the moon writhe with jealousy, put out her head. She lost her heart to the good looks of the prince, and sent her nurse to fetch him so that she might learn where he came from and how he had got into her private garden where even lions and wolves did not venture. The nurse went, and was struck with amazement at the sun-like radiance of his face; she salaamed and said: "O youth! welcome! the lady of the garden calls you; come!" He went with her and into a palace which was like a house in Paradise, and saw seated on the royal carpets of the throne a girl whose brilliance shamed the shining sun. He salaamed; she rose, took him by the hand and placed him near her. "O young man! who are you? Where do you come from? How did you get into this garden?" He told her his story from beginning to end, and Lady Latifa [9] replied: "This is folly! It will make you a vagabond of the earth, and lead you to destruction. Come, cease such talk! No one can go to the Caucasus. Stay with me and be thankful, for here is a throne which you can share with me, and in my society you can enjoy my wealth. I will do whatever you wish; I will bring here <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;qulmus' adjectives='' verbs='do;bring;deal;wish' valence='5.78916666667' arousal='3.8775' dominance='5.9625'>King</entity> Qulmus and his daughter, and you can deal with them as you will."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>"O Lady Latifa," he said, "I have made a compact with heaven not to sit down off my feet till I have been to Waq of Qaf and have cleared up this matter, and have taken Mihrafruz from her father, as brave men take, and have put her in prison. When I have done all this I will come back to you in state and with a great following, and I will marry you according to the law." Lady Latifa argued and urged her wishes, but in vain; the prince was not to be moved. Then she called to the cupbearers for new wine, for she thought that when his head was hot with it he might consent to stay. The pure, clear wine was brought; she filled a cup and gave to him. He said: "O most enchanting sweetheart! it is the rule for the host to drink first and then the guest." So to make him lose his head, she drained the cup; then filled it again and gave him. He drank it off, and she took a lute from one of the singers and played upon it with skill which witched away the sense of all who heard. But it was all in vain; three days passed in such festivities, and on the fourth the prince said: "O joy of my eyes! I beg now that you will bid me farewell, for my way is long and the fire of your love darts flame into the harvest of my heart. By heaven"s grace I may accomplish my purpose, and, if so, I will come back to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>Now she saw that she could not in any way change his resolve, she told her nurse to bring a certain casket which contained, she said, something exhilarating which would help the prince on his journey. The box was brought, and she divided off a portion of what was within and gave it to the prince to eat. Then, and while he was all unaware, she put forth her hand to a stick fashioned like a snake; she said some words over it and struck him so sharply on the shoulder that he cried out; then he made a pirouette and found that he was a deer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>When he knew what had been done to him he thought, "All the threads of affliction are gathered together; I have lost my last chance!" He tried to escape, but the magician sent for her goldsmith, who, coming, overlaid the deer-horns with gold and jewels. The kerchief which that day she had had in her hand was then tied round its neck, and this freed it from her attentions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='98'>The prince-deer now bounded into the garden and at once sought some way of escape. It found none, and it joined the other deer, which soon made it their leader. Now, although the prince had been transformed into the form of a deer, he kept his man"s heart and mind. He said to himself, "Thank heaven that the Lady Latifa has changed me into this shape, for at least deer are beautiful." He remained for some time living as a deer amongst the rest, but at length resolved that an end to such a life must be put ill some way. He looked again for some place by which he could get out of the magic garden. Following round the wall he reached a lower part; he remembered the Divine Names and flung himself over, saying, "Whatever happens is by the will of God." When he looked about he found that he was in the very same place he had jumped from; there was the palace, there the garden and the deer! Eight times he leaped over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='garden;palace;deer;leap;time;change' adjectives='' verbs='be;start;leap;have;go;find' valence='5.78681818182' arousal='3.91136363636' dominance='5.43909090909'>the wall</entity> and eight times found himself where he had started from; but after the ninth leap there was a change, there was a palace and there was a garden, but the deer were gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='99'>Presently a girl of such moon-like beauty opened a window that the prince lost to her a hundred hearts. She was delighted with the beautiful deer, and cried to her nurse: "Catch it! if you will I will give you this necklace, every pearl of which is worth a kingdom." The nurse coveted the pearls, but as she was three hundred years old she did not know how she could catch a deer. However, she went down into the garden and held out some grass, but when she went near the creature ran away. The girl watched with great excitement from the palace window, and called: "O nurse, if you don"t catch it, I will kill you!" "I am killing myself," shouted back the old woman. The girl saw that nurse tottering along and went down to help, marching with the gait of a prancing peacock. When she saw the gilded horns and the kerchief she said: "It must be accustomed to the hand, and be some royal pet!" The prince had it in mind that this might be another magician who could give him some other shape, but still it seemed best to allow himself to be caught. So he played about the girl and let her catch him by the neck. A leash was brought, fruits were given, and it was caressed with delight. It was taken to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foot;cord;s;seat' adjectives='able' verbs='be;raise;jump;bring;take;tie;order' valence='5.81058823529' arousal='3.98235294118' dominance='5.58058823529'>the palace</entity> and tied at the foot of the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='foot;cord;s;seat' adjectives='able' verbs='be;raise;jump;bring;take;tie;order' valence='5.81058823529' arousal='3.98235294118' dominance='5.58058823529'>Lady Jamila</entity>"s raised seat, but she ordered a longer cord to be brought so that it might be able to jump up beside her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='100'>When the nurse went to fix the cord she saw tears falling from its eyes, and that it was dejected and sorrowful "O Lady Jamila! this is a wonderful deer, it is crying; I never saw a deer cry before." Jamila darted down like a flash of lightning, and saw that it was so. It rubbed its head on her feet and then shook it so sadly that the girl cried for sympathy. She patted it and said: "Why are you sad, my heart? Why do you cry, my soul? Is it because I have caught you? I love you better than my own life." But, spite of her comforting, it cried the more. Then Jamila said: "Unless I am mistaken, this is the work of my wicked sister Latifa, who by magic art turns servants of God into beasts of the field." At these words the deer uttered sounds, and laid its head on her feet. Then Jamila was sure it was a man, and said: "Be comforted, I will restore you to your own shape." She bathed herself and ordered the deer to be bathed, put on clean raiment, called for a box which stood in an alcove, opened it and gave a portion of what was in it to the deer to eat. Then she slipped her hand under her carpet and produced a stick to which she said something. She struck the deer hard, it pirouetted and became <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='deer' adjectives='' verbs='strike;become;pirouett' valence='5.212' arousal='4.51' dominance='4.74'>Prince Almas</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>The broidered kerchief and the jewels lay upon the ground. The prince prostrated himself in thanks to heaven and Jamila, and said: "O delicious person! O Chinese Venus! how shall I excuse myself for giving you so much trouble? With what words can I thank you?" Then she called for a clothes-wallet and chose out a royal dress of honour. Her attendants dressed him in it, and brought him again before the tender-hearted lady. She turned to him a hundred hearts, took his hand and seated him beside her, and said: "O youth! tell me truly who you are and where you come from, and how you fell into the power of my sister."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='102'>Even when he was a deer the prince had much admired Jamila now he thought her a thousand times more lovely than before. He judged that in truth alone was safety, and so told her his whole story. Then she asked: "O Prince Almas-ruh-bakhsh, do you still wish so much to make this journey to Waq of Qaf? What hope is there in it? The road is dangerous even near here, and this is not yet the borderland of the Caucasus. Come, give it up! It is a great risk, and to go is not wise. It would be a pity for a man like you to fall into the hands of jins and demons. Stay with me, and I will do whatever you wish."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>"O most delicious person!" he answered, "you are very generous, and the choice of my life lies in truth in your hands; but I beg one favour of you. If you love me, so do I too love you. If you really love me, do not forbid me to make this journey, but help me as far as you can. Then it may be that I shall succeed, and if I return with my purpose fulfilled I will marry you according to the law, and take you to my own country, and we will spend the rest of our lives together in pleasure and good companionship. Help me, if you can, and give me your counsel."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='104'>"O very stuff of my life," replied Jamila "I will give you things that are not in kings" treasuries, and which will be of the greatest use to you. First, there are the bow and arrows of his Reverence the Prophet Salih. Secondly, there is the Scorpion of Solomon (on whom be peace), which is a sword such as no king has; steel and stone are one to it; if you bring it down on a rock it will not be injured, and it will cleave whatever you strike. Thirdly, there is the dagger which the sage Timus himself made; this is most useful, and the man who wears it would not bend under seven camels" loads. What you have to do first is to get to the home of the Simurgh, [10] and to make friends with him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>"O new fruit of life! you must just do what I tell you, and you must use your eyes and your brains, for if you don"t you will find yourself at the place of the negroes, who are a bloodthirsty set; and God forbid they should lay hands on your precious person."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='107'>Then she took the bow and quiver of arrows, the sword, and the dagger out of a box, and the prince let fall a Bismillah, and girt them all on. Then Jamila of the houri-face, produced two saddle-bags of ruby-red silk, one filled with roasted fowl and little cakes, and the other with stones of price. Next she gave him a horse as swift as the breeze of the morning, and she said: "Accept all these things from me; ride till you come to a rising ground, at no great distance from here, where there is a spring. It is called the Place of Gifts, and you must stay there one night. There you will see many wild beasts--lions, tigers, leopards, apes, and so on. Before you get there you must capture some game. On the long road beyond there dwells a lion-king, alla if other beasts did not fear him they would ravage the whole country and let no one pass. The lion is a red transgressor, so when he comes rise and do him reverence; take a cloth and rub the dust and earth from his face, then set the game you have taken before him, well cleansed, and lay the hands of respect on your breast. When he wishes to eat, take your knife and cut pieces of the meat and set them before him with a bow. In this way you will enfold that lion-king in perfect friendship, and he will be most useful to you, and you will be safe from molestation by the negroes. When you go on from the Place of Gifts, be sure you do not take the right-hand road; take the left, for the other leads by the negro castle, which is known as the Place of Clashing Swords, and where there are forty negro captains each over three thousand or four thousand more. Their chief is Taramtaq. [11] Further on than this is <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='simurgh' adjectives='' verbs='be' valence='6.83' arousal='3.605' dominance='6.135'>the home</entity> of the Simurgh."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>Having stored these things in the prince"s memory, she said: "You will see everything happen just as I have said." Then she escorted him a little way; they parted, and she went home to mourn his absence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>Prince Almas, relying on the Causer of Causes, rode on to the Place of Gifts and dismounted at the platform. Everything happened just as Jamila had foretold; when one or two watches of the night had passed, he saw that the open ground around him was full of such stately and splendid animals as he had never seen before. By-and-by, they made way for a wonderfully big lion, which was eighty yards from nose to tail-tip, and was a magnificent creature. The prince advanced and saluted it; it proudly drooped its head and forelocks and paced to the platform. Seventy or eighty others were with it, and now encircled it at a little distance. It laid its right paw over its left, and the prince took the kerchief Jamila had given him for the purpose, and rubbed the dust and earth from its face; then brought forward the game he had prepared, and crossing his hands respectfully on his breast stood waiting before it. When it wished for food he cut off pieces of the meat and put them in its mouth. The serving lions also came near and the prince would have stayed his hand, but the king-lion signed to him to feed them too. This he did, laying the meat on the platform. Then the king-lion beckoned the prince to come near and said: "Sleep at ease; my guards will watch.". So, surrounded by the lion-guard, he slept till dawn, when the king lion said good-bye, and gave him a few of his own hairs and said: "When you are in any difficulty, burn one of these and I will be there." Then it went off into the jungle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='110'>Prince Almas immediately started; he rode till he came to the parting of the ways. He remembered quite well that the right-hand way was short and dangerous, but he bethought himself too that whatever was written on his forehead would happen, and took the forbidden road. By-and-by he saw a castle, and knew from what Jamila had told him that it was the Place of Clashing Swords. He would have liked to go back by the way ho had come, but courage forbade, and he said, "What has been preordained from eternity will happen to me," and went on towards the castle. He was thinking of tying his horse to a tree which grew near the gate when a negro came out and spied him. "Ha!" said the wretch to himself, "this is good; Taram-taq has not eaten man-meat for a long time, and is craving for some. I will take this creature to him." He took hold of the prince"s reins, and said: "Dismount, man-child! Come to my master. He has wanted to eat man-meat this long time back." "What nonsense are you saying?" said the prince, and other such words. When the negro understood that he was being abused, he cried: "Come along! I will put you into such a state that the birds of the air will weep for you." Then the prince drew the Scorpion of Solomon and struck him--struck him on the leathern belt and shore him through so that the sword came out on the other side.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>There was water close at hand, and the prince made his ablution, and then said: "O my heart! a wonderful task lies upon you." A second negro came out of the fort, and seeing what had been done, went back and told his chief. Others wished to be doubled, and went out, and of every one the Scorpion of Solomon made two. Then Taram-taq sent for a giant negro named Chil-maq, who in the day of battle was worth three hundred, and said to him: "I shall thank you to fetch me that man."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='112'>Chil-maq went out, tall as a tower, and bearing a shield of eight millstones, and as he walked he shouted: "Ho! blunder-head! by what right do you come to our country and kill our people? Come! make two of me." As the prince was despicable in his eyes, he tossed aside his club and rushed to grip him with his hands. He caught him by the collar, tucked him under his arm and set off with him to Taram-taq. But the prince drew the dagger of Timus and thrust it upwards through the giant"s armpit, for its full length. This made Chil-maq drop him and try to pick up his club; but when he stooped the mighty sword shore him through at the waist.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>When news of his champion"s death reached Taram-taq he put himself at the head of an army of his negroes and led them forth. Many fell before the magic sword, and the prince laboured on in spite of weakness and fatigue till he was almost worn out. In a moment of respite from attack he struck his fire-steel and burned a hair of the king-lion; and he had just succeeded in this when the negroes charged again and all but took him prisoner. Suddenly from behind the distant veil of the desert appeared an army of lions led by their king. "What brings these scourges of heaven here?" cried the negroes. They came roaring up, and put fresh life into the prince. He fought on, and when he struck on a belt the wearer fell in two, and when on a head he cleft to the waist. Then the ten thousand mighty lions joined the fray and tore in pieces man and horse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>Taram-taq was left alone; he would have retired into his fort, but the prince shouted: "Whither away, accursed one? Are you fleeing before me?" At these defiant words the chief shouted back, "Welcome, man! Come here and I will soften you to wax beneath my club." Then he hurled his club at the prince"s head, but it fell harmless because the prince had quickly spurred his horse forward. The chief, believing he had hit him, was looking down for him, when all at once he came up behind and cleft him to the waist and sent him straight to hell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='115'>The king-lion greatly praised the dashing courage of Prince Almas. They went together into the Castle of Clashing Swords and found it adorned and fitted in princely fashion. In it was a daughter of Taram taq, still a child She sent a message to Prince Almas saying, "O king of the world! choose this slave to be your handmaid. Keep her with you; where you go, there she will go!" He sent for her and she kissed his feet and received the Mussulman faith at his hands. He told her he was going a long journey on important business, and that when he came back he would take her and her possessions to his own country, but that for the present she must stay in the castle. Then he made over the fort and all that was in it to the care of the lion, saying: "Guard them, brother! let no one lay a hand on them." He said goodbye, chose a fresh horse from the chief"s stable and once again took <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;horse;chief;goodbye' adjectives='fresh;stable' verbs='say;choose;take' valence='5.607' arousal='3.923' dominance='5.775'>the road</entity>.</paragraph>

It was carpeted with flowers--roses, tulips, and clover; it had lovely lawns, and amongst them running water. This choicest place of earth filled him with wonder. There was a tree such as he had never seen before; its branches were alike, but it bore flowers and fruit of a thousand kinds. Near it a reservoir had been fashioned of four sorts of stone--touchstone, pure stone, marble, and loadstone. In and out of it flowed water like attar. The prince felt sure this must be the place of the Simurgh." he dismounted, turned his horse loose to graze, ate some of the food <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='food;horse' adjectives='loose' verbs='give;drink;turn;graze;dismount;sleep;lay;have;eat' valence='6.27' arousal='4.08461538462' dominance='5.86461538462'>Jamila</entity> had given him, drank of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='food;horse' adjectives='loose' verbs='give;drink;turn;graze;dismount;sleep;lay;have;eat' valence='6.27' arousal='4.08461538462' dominance='5.86461538462'>the stream</entity> and lay down to sleep.</paragraph>

When he could see clearly he made out a mountain-like dragon whose heavy breast crushed the stones beneath it into putty. He remembered the Thousand Names of God and took the bow of Salih from its case and three arrows from their quiver. He bound the dagger of Timus firmly to his waist and hung the scorpion of Solomon round his neck. Then he set an arrow on the string and released it with such force that it went in at the monster"s eye right up to the notch. The dragon writhed on itself, and belched forth an evil vapour, and beat the ground with its head till the earth quaked. Then the prince took a second arrow and shot into its throat. It drew in its breath and would have sucked the prince into its maw, but when he was within striking distance he drew his sword and, having committed himself to God, struck a mighty blow which cut the creature"s neck down to the gullet. The foul vapour of the beast and horror at its strangeness now overcame the prince, and he fainted. When he came to himself he found that he was drenched in the gore of the dead monster. He rose and thanked God for his deliverance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='118'>The nest of the Simurgh was in the wonderful tree above him, and in it were young birds; the parents were away searching for food. They always told the children, before they left them, not to put their heads out of the nest; but, to-day, at the noise of the fight below, they looked down and so saw the whole affair. By the time the dragon had been killed they were very hungry and set up a clamour for food. The prince therefore cut up the dragon and fed them with it, bit by bit, till they had eaten the whole. He then washed himself and lay down to rest, and he was still asleep when the Simurgh came home. As a rule, the young birds raised a clamour of welcome when their parents came near, but on this day they were so full of dragon-meat that they had no choice, they had to go to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='119'>As they flew nearer, the old birds saw the prince lying under the tree and no sign of life in the nest. They thought that the misfortune which for so many earlier years had befallen them had again happened and that their nestlings had disappeared. They had never been able to find out the murderer, and now suspected the prince. "He has eaten our children and sleeps after it; he must die," said the father-bird, and flew back to the hills and clawed up a huge stone which he meant to let fall on the prince"s head. But his mate said, "Let us look into the nest first for to kill an innocent person would condemn us at the Day of Resurrection." They flew nearer, and presently the young birds woke and cried, "Mother, what have you brought for us?" and they told the whole story of the fight, and of how they were alive only by the favour of the young man under the tree, and of his cutting up the dragon and of their eating it. The mother-bird then remarked, "Truly, father! you were about to do a strange thing, and a terrible sin has been averted from you." Then the Simurgh flew off to a distance with the great stone and dropped it. It sank down to the very middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='middle' verbs='sink' valence='5.55666666667' arousal='3.86333333333' dominance='4.96666666667'>the earth</entity>.</paragraph>

When he got up he salaamed to it, who returned his greeting with joy and gratitude, and caressed him and said: "O youth, tell me true! who are you, and where are you going? And how did you cross that pitiless desert where never yet foot of man had trod?" The prince told his story from beginning to end, and finished by saying: "Now it is my heart"s wish that you should help me to get to Waq of the Caucasus. Perhaps, by your favour, I shall accomplish my task and avenge my brothers." In reply the Simurgh." first blessed the deliverer of his children, and then went on: "What you have done no child of man has ever done before; you assuredly have a claim on all my help, for every year up till now that dragon has come here and has destroyed my nestlings, and I have never been able to find who was the murderer and to avenge myself. By God"s grace you have removed my children"s powerful foe. I regard you as a child of my own. Stay with me; I will give you everything you desire, and I will establish a city here for you, and will furnish it with every requisite; I will give you the land of the Caucasus, and will make its princes subject to you. Give up the journey to Waq, it is full of risk, and the jins there will certainly kill you." But nothing could move the prince, and seeing this the bird went on: "Well, so be it! When you wish to set forth you must go into the plain and take seven head of deer, and must make water-tight bags of their hides and keep their flesh in seven portions. Seven seas lie on our way--I will carry you over them; but if I have not food and drink we shall fall into the sea and be drowned. When I ask for it you must put food and water into my mouth. So we shall make the journey safely."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>The prince did all as he was told, then they took flight; they crossed the seven seas, and at each one the prince fed the Simurgh When they alighted on the shore of the last sea, it said: "O my son! there lies your road; follow it to the city. Take thee three feathers of mine, and, if you are in a difficulty, burn one and I will be with you in the twinkling of an eye."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='122'>The prince walked on in solitude till he reached the city. He went in and wandered about through all quarters, and through bazaars and lanes and squares, in the least knowing from whom he could ask information about the riddle of Mihr-afruz. He spent seven days thinking it over in silence. From the first day of his coming he had made friends with a young cloth-merchant, and a great liking had sprung up between them. One day he said abruptly to his companion: "O dear friend! I wish you would tell me what the rose did to the cypress, and what the sense of the riddle is." The merchant started, and exclaimed: "If there were not brotherly affection between us, I would cut off your head for asking me this!" "If you meant to kill me," retorted the prince, "you would still have first to tell me what I want to know." When the merchant saw that the prince was in deadly earnest, he said: "If you wish to hear the truth of the matter you must wait upon our king. There is no other way; no one else will tell you. I have a well-wisher at the Court, named Farrukh-fal, [12] and will introduce you to him." "That would be excellent," cried the prince.

"I, your slave, once had riches and state and power; there are many such stones in my country. On my way here I was plundered at the Castle of Clashing Swords, and I saved this one thing only, hidden in my bathing-cloth." In return for the diamond, King Sinaubar showered gifts of much greater value, for he remembered that it was the last possession of the prince. He showed the utmost kindness and hospitality, and gave his wazir orders to instal the prince in the royal guest-house. He took much pleasure in his visitor"s society; they were together every day and spent the time most pleasantly. Several times the king said: "Ask me for something, that I may give it you."One day he so pressed to know what would pleasure the prince, that the latter said: "I have only one wish, and that I will name to you in private." The king at once commanded every one to withdraw, and then Prince Almas said: "The desire of my life is to know what the rose did to the cypress, and what meaning there is in the words."

The prince drank from the king"s own cup, and when his head was hot with wine he took a lute from one of the musicians and placed himself on the carpet border and sang and sang till he witched away the sense of all who listened. Applause and compliments rang from every side. The king filled his cup and called the prince and gave it him and said: "Name your wish! it is yours."

Food was called for and table-cloths were spread. Delicate meats were set before the dog, and water given it in a royal cup of Chinese crystal. When it had eaten its fill, its leavings were placed before the lovely woman and she was made to eat of them. She wept and her tears were pearls; she smiled and her lips shed roses.

I was alone, I took my turban for a rope and my cap for a bucket. There was a good deal of water, but when I let down my rope, something caught it, and I could not in any way draw it back. I shouted down into the well: "O! servant of God! whoever you are, why do you deal unfairly with me? I am dying of thirst, let go! in God"s name." A cry came up in answer, "O servant of God! we have been in the well a long time; in God"s name get us out!" After trying a thousand schemes, I drew up two blind women.

But if the matter becomes known to her mother she will have you burned in the fire.

I reprimanded the groom and beat him. He asked where his fault lay, and said that every night my wife took one or other of these horses and rode away, and came back only just before dawn. A flame kindled in my heart, and I asked myself where she could go and what she could do. I told the groom to be silent, and when next Gul took a horse from the stable to saddle another quickly and bring it to me. That day I did not hunt, but stayed at home to follow the matter up. I lay down as usual at night and pretended to fall asleep. When I seemed safely off Gul got up and went to the stable as her custom was. That night it was Tiger"s turn.

I was dumfounded, for once when I had struck her with a rose stalk she had complained and fretted for three days! Then the negro said to her: "How now, ugly one and shaven head! Why are you so late, and why are you not wearing wedding garments?" She answered him: "That person did not go to sleep quickly, and he stayed at home all day, so that I was not able to adorn myself. I came as soon as I could." In a little while he called her to sit beside him; but this was more than I could bear. I lost control of myself and rushed upon him. He clutched my collar and we grappled in a death struggle. Suddenly she came behind me, caught my feet and threw me. While he held me on the ground, she drew out my own knife and gave it to him. I should have been killed but for that faithful dog which seized his throat and pulled him down and pinned him to the ground. Then I got up and despatched the wretch. There were four other negroes at the place; three I killed and the fourth got away, and has taken refuge beneath the throne of Mihr-afruz, daughter of King Quimus.

The king-lion came out to meet him; he took the negro chief"s daughter---whose name was also Gul--in lawful marriage, and then marched with her and her possessions and her attendants to the Place of Gifts. Here they halted for a night, and at dawn said good-bye to the king-lion and set out for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='good-bye;king-lion;dawn;s;country' adjectives='' verbs='say;set;halt' valence='5.64' arousal='4.06' dominance='5.45125'>Jamila</entity>"s country.</paragraph>

A few days later she entrusted her affairs to her wazir, and made preparation to go with the prince to his own country. Before she started she restored all the men whom her sister, Latifa, had bewitched, to their own forms, and received their blessings, and set them forward to their homes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='193'>Her plan was a very simple one, and had never yet failed. When she wanted a child she just flung her ball in the direction of the child"s home, and however far off it might be, the ball was sure to reach it. Then, as soon as the child saw it, the ball would begin rolling slowly back to the witch, just keeping a little ahead of the child, so that he always thought that he could catch it the next minute. But he never did, and, what was more, his parents never saw him again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='194'>Of course you must not suppose that all the fathers and mothers who had lost children made no attempts to find them, but the forest was so large, and the witch was so cunning in knowing exactly where they were going to search, that it was very easy for her to keep out of the way.

But as he did so it began to roll very gently downhill. The boy could not let it roll away, when it was so close to him, so he gave chase. The ball seemed always within his grasp, yet he could never catch it; it went quicker and quicker, and the boy grew more and more excited. That time he almost touched it--no, he missed it by a hair"s breadth! Now, surely, if he gave a spring he could get in front of it!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='212'>This pleased the old woman so much that she brought him another basin of food, and while he was eating it she talked to him, and this is what she said: "Far away, on the other side of the great river, is the home of the Bad One. In his house is much gold, and what is more precious even than the gold, a little bridge, which lengthens out when the Bad One waves his hand, so that there is no river or sea that he cannot cross. Now I want that bridge and some of the gold for myself, and that is the reason that I have stolen so many boys by means of my ball. I have tried to teach them how to gain the gifts of the good spirits, but none of them would fast long enough, and at last I had to send them away to perform simple, easy little tasks. But you have been strong and faithful, and you can do this thing if you listen to what I tell you!

But do not be afraid; trust to the ball, and you will be quite safe!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='213'>The boy took the ball and put it in a bag. Then he made himself a club and a bow, and some arrows which would fly further than anyone else"s arrows, because of the strength the good spirits had given him. They had also bestowed on him the power of changing his shape, and had increased the quickness of his eyes and ears so that nothing escaped him. And in some way or other they made him understand that if he needed more help they would give it to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='214'>When all these things were ready the boy bade farewell to the witch and set out.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='215'>At last, after many days, he came to the river, and beyond it he noticed a small hut standing on a hill which he guessed to be the home of the Bad One. But the stream flowed so quickly that he could not see how he was ever to cross it, and in order to test how swift the current really was, he broke a branch from a tree and threw it in. It seemed hardly to touch the water before it was carried away, and even his magic sight could not follow it. He could not help feeling frightened, but he hated giving up anything that he had once undertaken, and, fastening the ball on his right foot, he ventured on the river. To his surprise he was able to stand up; then a panic seized him, and he scrambled up the bank again. In a minute or two he plucked up courage to go a little further into the river, but again its width frightened him, and a second time he turned back. However, he felt rather ashamed of his cowardice, as it was quite clear that his ball could support him, and on his third trial he got safely to the other side.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='216'>Once there he replaced the ball in the bag, and looked carefully round him. The door of the Bad One"s hut was open, and he saw that the ceiling was supported by great wooden beams, from which hung the bags of gold and the little bridge. He saw, too, the Bad One sitting in the midst of his treasures eating his dinner, and drinking something out of a horn. It was plain to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plan;gold' adjectives='plain;able' verbs='be;steal;invent;get' valence='5.6425' arousal='4.011875' dominance='5.349375'>the boy</entity> that he must invent some plan of getting the Bad One out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='plan;gold' adjectives='plain;able' verbs='be;steal;invent;get' valence='5.6425' arousal='4.011875' dominance='5.349375'>the way</entity>, or else he would never be able to steal the gold or <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='plan;gold' adjectives='plain;able' verbs='be;steal;invent;get' valence='5.6425' arousal='4.011875' dominance='5.349375'>the bridge</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='217'>What should he do? Give horrible shrieks as if he were in pain? But the Bad One would not care whether he were murdered or not! Call him by his name? But the Bad One was very cunning, and would suspect some trick. He must try something better than that! Then suddenly an idea came to him, and he gave a little jump of joy. "Oh, how stupid of me not to think of that before!" said he, and he wished with all his might that the Bad One should become very hungry--so hungry that he could not wait a moment for fresh food to be brought to him. And sure enough at that instant the Bad One called out to his servant, "You did not bring food that would satisfy a sparrow Fetch some more at once, for I am perfectly starving." Then, without giving <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='larder;chair;hunger;time' adjectives='' verbs='go;stagger;get;roll;give' valence='5.723' arousal='3.977' dominance='5.06'>the woman</entity> time to go to the larder, he got up from his chair, and rolled, staggering from hunger, towards <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='larder;chair;hunger;time' adjectives='' verbs='go;stagger;get;roll;give' valence='5.723' arousal='3.977' dominance='5.06'>the kitchen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='218'>Directly the door had closed on the Bad One the boy ran in, pulled down a bag of gold from the beam, and tucked it under his left arm. Next he unhooked the little bridge and put it under his right. He did not try to escape, as most boys of his age would have done, for the wisdom put into his mind by the good spirits taught him that before he could reach the river and make use of the bridge the Bad One would have tracked him by his footsteps and been upon him. So, making himself very small and thin, he hid himself behind a pile of buffalo skins in the corner, first tearing a slit through one of them, so that he could see what was going on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='219'>He had hardly settled himself when the servant entered the room, and, as she did so, the last bag of gold on the beam fell to the ground--for they had begun to fall directly the boy had taken the first one.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='240'>After Ball-Carrier had managed to drown the Bad One so that he could not do any more mischief, he forgot the way to his grandmother"s house, and could not find it again, though he searched everywhere. During this time he wandered into many strange places, and had many adventures; and one day he came to a hut where a young girl lived. He was tired and hungry and begged her to let him in and rest, and he stayed a long while, and the girl became his wife. One morning he saw two children playing in front of the hut, and went out to speak to them. But as soon as they saw him they set up cries of horror and ran away. "They are the children of my sister who has been on a long journey," replied his wife, "and now that she knows you are my husband she wants to kill you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='241'>"Oh, well, let her try," replied Ball-Carrier. "It is not the first time people have wished to do that. And here I am still, you see!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='242'>"Be careful," said the wife, "she is very cunning." But at this moment the sister-in-law came up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='243'>"How do you do, brother-in-law? I have heard of you so often that I am very glad to meet you. I am told that you are more powerful than any man on earth, and as I am powerful too, let us try which is the strongest."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='244'>"That will be delightful," answered he. "Suppose we begin with a short race, and then we will go on to other things."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='245'>"That will suit me very well," replied the woman, who was a witch. "And let us agree that the one who wins shall have the right to kill the other."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='246'>"Oh, certainly," said Ball-Carrier;" and I don"t think we shall find a flatter course than the prairie itself--no one knows how many miles it stretches. We will run to the end and back again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='247'>This being settled they both made ready for the race, and Ball-Carrier silently begged the good spirits to help him, and not to let him fall into the hands of this wicked witch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='248'>"When the sun touches the trunk of that tree we will start," said she, as they both stood side by side. But with the first step Ball-Carrier changed himself into a wolf and for a long way kept ahead. Then gradually he heard her creeping up behind him, and soon she was in front. So Ball-Carrier took the shape of a pigeon and flew rapidly past her, but in a little while she was in front again and the end of the prairie was in sight. "A crow can fly faster than a pigeon," thought he, and as a crow he managed to pass her and held his ground so long that he fancied she was quite beaten. The witch began to be afraid of it too, and putting out all her strength slipped past him. Next he put on the shape of a hawk, and in this form he reached the bounds of the prairie, he and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='form;shape;bound;moment;prairie;hawk' adjectives='' verbs='put;turn;reach' valence='5.22272727273' arousal='4.11636363636' dominance='5.57909090909'>the witch</entity> turning homewards at the moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='249'>Bird after bird he tried, but every time the witch gained on him and took the lead. At length the goal was in sight, and Ball-Carrier knew that unless he could get ahead now he would be killed before his own door, under the eyes of his wife. His eyes had grown dim from fatigue, his wings flapped wearily and hardly bore him along, while the witch seemed as fresh as ever. What bird was there whose flight was swifter than his? Would not the good spirits tell him? Ah, of course he knew; why had he not thought of it at first and spared himself all that fatigue? And the next instant a humming bird, dressed in green and blue, flashed past the woman and entered the house. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ball-carrier;shape;race;head;time' adjectives='furious;certain;own' verbs='pant;feel;win;kill;have;lose;strike;come;change' valence='4.85055555556' arousal='4.40555555556' dominance='5.15833333333'>The witch</entity> came panting up, furious at having lost the race which she felt certain of winning; and Ball-Carrier, who had by this time changed back into his own shape, struck her on the head and killed her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='250'>For a long while Ball-Carrier was content to stay quietly at home with his wife and children, for he was tired of adventures, and only did enough hunting to supply the house with food.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='251'>"When I am dead do not bury me in the earth," he said, "but put me over there, among that clump of trees." So his wife and her three children watched by him as long as he was alive, and after he was dead they took him up and laid the body on a platform of stakes which they had prepared in the grove. And as they returned weeping to the hut they caught a glimpse of the ball rolling away down the path back to the old grandmother. One of the sons sprang forward to stop it, for Ball-Carrier had often told them the tale of how it had helped him to cross <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ball-carrier;club;bow;tale;arrow;son;war' adjectives='quick;content' verbs='be;help;spring;stop;cross;have;put;tell' valence='5.86523809524' arousal='3.93571428571' dominance='5.4519047619'>the river</entity>, but it was too quick for him, and they had to content themselves with the war club and bow and arrows, which were put carefully away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='252'>By-and-by some travellers came past, and the chief among them asked leave to marry Ball-Carrier"s daughter.

One morning the girl, who had had no supper and no breakfast, wandered off to look for cranberries, and though she was quite near home was astonished at noticing a large hut, which certainly had not been there when last she had come that way. No one was about, so she ventured to peep in, and her surprise was increased at seeing, heaped up in one corner, a quantity of food of all sorts, while a little robin redbreast stood perched on a beam looking down upon her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='254'>"It is my father, I am sure," she cried; and the bird piped in answer.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='256'>When the man came back he found the girl looking so much prettier and fatter than when he had left her, that he insisted that they should be married on the spot. And the mother, who did not know how to get rid of him, gave in.</paragraph>

Very soon they all left the house together, and walked to the other hut, which the girl"s husband saw for the first time, as it was hid in a hollow. He followed, and noticed that each one went up to the redbreast, and shook him by the claw; and he then entered boldly and shook the bird"s claw too.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='279'>So she picked up a knife and scraped away all the gold which had stuck to his skin, and which had been sticking there ever since he first stole it. After she had finished she asked again:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='280'>"My grandson, did you manage to get that bridge from the Bad One?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='281'>"Yes, grandmother, I got that too," answered he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='282'>"Where is it?" she asked, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='arm-pit;arm' adjectives='right' verbs='ask;lift;point' valence='5.896' arousal='4.136' dominance='6.516'>Ball-Carrier</entity> lifted his right arm, and pointed to his arm-pit.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='284'>Then the witch did something that nobody in the world could have guessed that she would do. First, she took the gold and said to Ball-carrier:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='285'>"My grandson, this gold must be hidden in the earth, for if people think they can get it when they choose, they will become lazy and stupid. But if we take it and bury it in different parts of the world they will have to work for it if they want it, and then will only find a little at a time." And as she spoke, she pulled up one of the poles of the hut, and Ball-Carrier saw that underneath was a deep, deep hole, which seemed to have no bottom. Down this hole she poured all the gold, and when it was out of sight it ran about all over the world, where people that dig hard sometimes find it. And after that was done she put the pole back again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='286'>Next she lifted down a spade from a high shelf, where it had grown quite rusty, and dug a very small hole on the opposite side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shelf;hole;side;spade' adjectives='opposite;deep;next;high;rusty;small' verbs='dig;lift;grow;have' valence='5.30777777778' arousal='3.78055555556' dominance='5.17055555556'>the hut</entity>--very small, but very deep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='287'>"Give me the bridge," said she, "for I am going to bury it here. If anyone was to get hold of it, and find that they could cross rivers and seas without any trouble, they would never discover how to cross them for themselves. I am a witch, and if I had chosen I could easily have cast my spells over the Bad One, and have made him deliver them to you the first day you came into my hut. But then you would never have fasted, and never have planned how to get what you wanted, and never have known the good spirits, and would have been fat and idle to the end of your days. And now go; in that hut, which you can just see far away, live your father and mother, who are old people now, and need a son to hunt for them. You have done what you were set to do, and I need you no more."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='291'>The Bunyip</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='292'>Long, long ago, far, far away on the other side of the world, some young men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and children. The sun was hot, but they liked heat, and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest, or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang, which always returns to the thrower. They did not get on very fast at this rate, but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water, but was now, in the height of summer, only a set of pools, each surrounded with a fringe of plants, with bulrushes standing in the inside of all. In that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes, which they think as good as onions, and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp. It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket, and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out: "After all, why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children? Let them come and get the roots for themselves; but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='293'>This delighted the rest of the party, and they all began to arrange their fishing lines, made from the bark of the yellow mimosa, and to search for bait for their hooks. Most of them used worms, but one, who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet, cut off a little bit and baited his line with it, unseen by his companions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='294'>For a long time they cast patiently, without receiving a single bite; the sun had grown low in the sky, and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed, not even with a basket of roots to show; when the youth, who had baited his hook with raw meat, suddenly saw his line disappear under the water. Something, a very heavy fish he supposed, was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet, and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool. He cried to his friends to help him, and at last, trembling with fright at what they were going to see, they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal, but something of both, with a long, broad tail. They looked at each other with horror, cold shivers running down their spines; for though they had never beheld it, there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was--the cub of the awful Bunyip!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='295'>All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail, answered by another from the other side of the pool, as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them, rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes. "Let it go! let it go!" whispered the young men to each other; but the captor declared that he had caught it, and was going to keep it. "He had promised his sweetheart," he said, "that he would bring back enough meat for her father"s house to feast on for three days, and though they could not eat the little Bunyip, her brothers and sisters should have it to play with." So, flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back, he threw the little Bunyip on to his shoulders, and set out for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shoulder;distress;spear;back;s;mother' adjectives='poor;little' verbs='set;fling;cry;keep;heed;throw' valence='5.309375' arousal='4.225625' dominance='5.154375'>the camp</entity>, never heeding the poor mother"s cries of distress.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='296'>By this time it was getting near sunset, and the plain was in shadow, though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright. The youths had all ceased to be afraid, when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them, and, looking round, saw that the pool was slowly rising, and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered. "What could it be?" they asked one of another; "there was not a cloud in the sky, yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it do before." For an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen, then they turned and ran with all their might, the man with the Bunyip running faster than all. When he reached a high peak over-looking all the plain he stopped to take breath, and turned to see if he was safe yet. Safe! why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of water, and these were fast disappearing. They must run fast indeed if they were to escape. So on they flew, scarcely feeling the ground as they went, till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes scooped out of the earth where they had all been born. The old men were sitting in front, the children were playing, and the women chattering together, when the little Bunyip fell into their midst, and there was scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible was upon them. "The water! the water!" gasped one of the young men; and there it was, slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself. Parents and children clung together, as if by that means they could drive back the advancing flood; and the youth who had caused all this terrible catastrophe, seized his sweetheart, and cried: "I will climb with you to the top of that tree, and there no waters can reach us." But, as he spoke, something cold touched him, and quickly he glanced down at his feet. Then with a shudder he saw that they were feet no longer, but bird"s claws. He looked at the girl he was clasping, and beheld a great black bird standing at his side; he turned to his friends, but a flock of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place He put up his hands to cover his face, but they were no more hands, only the ends of wings; and when he tried to speak, a noise such as he had never heard before seemed to come from his throat, which had suddenly become narrow and slender. Already the water had risen to his waist, and he found himself sitting easily upon it, while its surface reflected back the image of a black swan, one of many.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='297'>Never again did the swans become men; but they are still different from other swans, for in the night-time those who listen can hear them talk in a language that is certainly not swan"s language; and there are even sounds of laughing and talking, unlike any noise made by the swans whom we know.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='298'>The little Bunyip was carried home by its mother, and after that the waters sank back to their own channels. The side of the pool where she lives is always shunned by everyone, as nobody knows when she may suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws. But people say that underneath the black waters of the pool she has a house filled with beautiful things, such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no idea of. Though how they know I cannot tell you, as nobody has ever seen it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='312'>The Holy Man did not answer, but went into an inner cave, from which he came out bearing something in his hand. "Do you see this basket?" said he. "It is a magical basket, and if you are hungry you have only got to say: "Little basket, little basket, do your duty," and you will eat the best dinner you ever had in your life. But when you have had enough, be sure you don"t forget to cry out: "That will do for to-day." Oh!--and one thing more--you need not show it to everybody and declare that I have give it to you. Do you understand?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='313'>Father Grumbler was always accustomed to think of himself as so unlucky that he did not know whether the Holy Man was not playing a trick upon him; but he took the basket without being polite enough to say either "Thank you," or "Good-morning," and went away. However, he only waited till he was out of sight of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='basket;duty;sight' adjectives='little' verbs='stoop;be;whisper;do;wait' valence='5.64' arousal='3.55416666667' dominance='5.205'>the cave</entity> before he stooped down and whispered: "Little basket, little basket, do your duty."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='314'>Now the basket had a lid, so that he could not see what was inside, but he heard quite clearly strange noises, as if a sort of scuffling was going on. Then the lid burst open, and a quantity of delicious little white rolls came tumbling out one after the other, followed by a stream of small fishes all ready cooked. What a quantity there were to be sure! The whole road was covered with them, and the banks on each side were beginning to disappear. Father Grumbler felt quite frightened at the torrent, but at last he remembered what the Holy Man had told him, and cried at the top of his voice: "Enough! enough! That will do for to-day!" And the lid of the basket closed with a snap.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='315'>Father Grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him, and sitting down on a heap of stones, he ate till he could eat no more. Trout, salmon, turbot, soles, and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know, lay boiled, fried, and grilled within reach of his hands. As the Holy Man had said, he had never eaten such a dinner; still, when he had done, he shook his head, and grumbled; "Yes, there is plenty to eat, of course, but it only makes me thirsty, and there is not a drop to drink anywhere."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='316'>Yet, somehow, he could never tell why, he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him, which he thought was miles, and miles, and miles away.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='321'>So they began by inviting Father Grumbler to sit down to the table, and brought out the best wine in the cellar, hoping it might loosen his tongue. But Father Grumbler was wiser than they gave him credit for, and though they tried in all manner of ways to find out who had given him the basket, he put them off, and kept his secret to himself. Unluckily, though he did not SPEAK, he did drink, and it was not long before he fell fast asleep.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='322'>It was dinner time when the man awoke, and, jumping up hastily, he set out for home, where he found all the children gathered round a basin of thin soup, and pushing their wooden bowls forward, hoping to have the first spoonful.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='324'>The children, wondering and delighted, repeated the words, but nothing happened.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='389'>This state of things went on for some weeks, then at last chance favoured him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='421'>It was late that night when Alonzo returned home.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='422'>The struggle had been hard, but Alonzo had his reward next day in the joy and relief with which Julia greeted him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>At last the waters parted softly, and floating on the surface he saw the beautiful woman whom he had fled from only a few nights before. He turned to run, but his feet were glued to the spot.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='440'>Then, his pistol being empty, he grasped the barrel with both hands, and stood ready to use it as a club should the Yara approach and closer.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='441'>In his excitement he had forgotten the river, and it was not till the cold water touched his feet that he stood still by instinct. The Yara saw that he was wavering, and suffering herself to sway gently backwards and forwards on the surface of the river, she began to sing. The song floated through the trees, now far and now near; no one could tell whence it came, the whole air seemed full of it. Alonzo felt his senses going and his will failing. His arms dropped heavily to his side, but in falling struck against <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='coat;shell;arm;side' adjectives='' verbs='drop;carry;promise;have;fall;strike' valence='5.3225' arousal='3.7125' dominance='5.345'>the sea</entity> shell, which, as he had promised <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='coat;shell;arm;side' adjectives='' verbs='drop;carry;promise;have;fall;strike' valence='5.3225' arousal='3.7125' dominance='5.345'>Julia</entity>, he had always carried in his coat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='442'>His dimmed mind was just clear enough to remember what she had said, and with trembling fingers, that were almost powerless to grasp, he drew it out.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='448'>In a very cold country, far across the seas, where ice and snow cover the ground for many months in the year, there lived a little hare, who, as his father and mother were both dead, was brought up by his grandmother. As he was too young, and she was too old, to work, they were very poor, and often did not have enough to eat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='449'>One day, when the little fellow was hungrier than usual, he asked his grandmother if he might go down to the river and catch a fish for their breakfast, as the thaw had come and the water was flowing freely again. She laughed at him for thinking that any fish would let itself be caught by a hare, especially such a young one; but as she had the rheumatism very badly, and could get no food herself, she let him go. "If he does not catch a fish he may find something else," she said to herself. So she told her grandson where to look for the net, and how he was to set it across <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='net;grandson;man' adjectives='' verbs='be;set;look;feel;start;call;tell' valence='5.78714285714' arousal='3.71928571429' dominance='5.41357142857'>the river</entity>; but just as he was starting, feeling himself quite a man, she called him back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='450'>"After all, I don"t know what is the use of your going, my boy! For even if you should catch a fish, I have no fire to cook it with."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='451'>"Let me catch my fish, and I will soon make you a fire," he answered gaily, for he was young, and knew nothing about the difficulties of fire-making.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='452'>It took him some time to haul the net through bushes and over fields, but at length he reached a pool in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fish;bush;grandmother;field;length;time;net;pool' adjectives='' verbs='be;set;reach;direct;swarm;haul;hear;take;have' valence='5.65238095238' arousal='3.71761904762' dominance='5.45619047619'>the river</entity> which he had often heard was swarming with fish, and here he set the net, as his grandmother had directed him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='453'>He was so excited that he hardly slept all night, and at the very first streak of dawn he ran as fast as ever he could down to the river. His heart beat as quickly as if he had had dogs behind him, and he hardly dared to look, lest he should be disappointed. Would there be even one fish? And at this thought the pangs of hunger made him feel quite sick with fear. But he need not have been afraid; in every mesh of the net was a fine fat fish, and of course the net itself was so heavy that he could only lift one corner. He threw some of the fish back into the water, and buried some more in a hole under a stone, where he would be sure to find them. Then he rolled up the net with the rest, put it on his back and carried it home. The weight of the load caused his back to ache, and he was thankful to drop it outside their hut, while he rushed in, full of joy, to tell his grandmother. "Be quick and clean them!" he said, "and I will go to those people"s tents on the other side of the water."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='454'>The old woman stared at him in horror as she listened to his proposal. Other people had tried to steal fire before, and few indeed had come back with their lives; but as, contrary to all her expectations, he had managed to catch such a number of fish, she thought that perhaps there was some magic about him which she did not know of, and did not try to hinder him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='455'>When the fish were all taken out, he fetched the net which he had laid out to dry, folded it up very small, and ran down to the river, hoping that he might find a place narrow enough for him to jump over; but he soon saw that it was too wide for even the best jumper in the world. For a few moments he stood there, wondering what was to be done, then there darted into his head some words of a spell which he had once heard a wizard use, while drinking from the river. He repeated them, as well as he could remember, and waited to see what would happen. In five minutes such a grunting and a puffing was heard, and columns of water rose into the air, though he could not tell what had made them. Then round the bend of the stream came fifteen huge whales, which he ordered to place themselves heads to tails, like stepping stones, so that he could jump from one to the other till he landed on the opposite shore. Directly he got there he told the whales that he did not need them any more, and sat down in the sand to rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='456'>Unluckily some children who were playing about caught sight of him, and one of them, stealing softly up behind him, laid tight hold of his ears.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='457'>"Throw it in the pot," said the old woman, as soon as he had told his story; "put it in that basket, and as soon as the water boils in the pot we will hang it over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='story;woman;pot;water;basket;boil' adjectives='old' verbs='hang;tell;say;have;put;throw' valence='5.420625' arousal='4.088125' dominance='5.605625'>the fire</entity>!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='458'>"Better kill it first," said the old man; and the hare listened, horribly frightened, but still looking secretly to see if there was no hole through which he could escape, if he had a chance of doing so. Yes, there was one, right in the top of the tent, so, shaking himself, as if with fright, he let the end of his net unroll itself a little.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='459'>"I wish that a spark of fire would fall on my net," whispered he; and the next minute a great log fell forward into the midst of the tent, causing every one to spring backwards. The sparks were scattered in every direction, and one fell on the net, making a little blaze. In an instant the hare had leaped through the hole, and was racing towards the river, with men, women, and children after him. There was no time to call back the whales, so, holding the net tight in his mouth, he wished himself across the river. Then he jumped high into the air, and landed safe on the other side, and after turning round to be sure that there was no chance of anyone pursuing him, trotted happily home to his grandmother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>"Didn"t I tell you I would bring you fire?" said he, holding up his net, which was now burning briskly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='461'>"But how did you cross the water?" inquired the old woman.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='462'>"Oh, I just jumped!" said he. And his grandmother asked him no more questions, for she saw that he was wiser than she.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='467'>There was once a turtle who lived among a great many people of different kinds, in a large camp near a big river which was born right up amongst the snows, and flowed straight away south till it reached a sea where the water was always hot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='468'>There were many other turtles in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='turtle;kind' adjectives='pleasant;many;lonely;other' verbs='feel;be;care;do' valence='6.175' arousal='3.365' dominance='5.8825'>the camp</entity>, and this turtle was kind and pleasant to them all, but he did not care for any of them very much, and felt rather lonely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='469'>At last he built himself a hut, and filled it with skins for seats, and made it as comfortable as any hut for miles round; and when it was quite finished he looked about among the young women to see which of them he should ask to be his wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='470'>It took him some time to make up his mind, for no turtle likes being hurried, but at length he found one girl who seemed prettier and more industrious than the rest, and one day he entered her home, and said: "Will you marry me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='471'>The young woman was so surprised at this question that she dropped the beaded slipper she was making, and stared at the turtle. She felt inclined to laugh--the idea was so absurd; but she was kind-hearted and polite, so she looked as grave as she could, and answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='472'>"But how are you going to provide for a family?

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='473'>"I can keep up with the best of them," replied the turtle, tossing his head. But though he was very much offended he did not let <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='last;much;hard' verbs='be;do;pray;consent;marry;beg;see;let;offend' valence='5.67272727273' arousal='4.14090909091' dominance='5.48272727273'>the girl</entity> see it, and begged and, prayed her so hard to marry him that, at last, she consented, very unwillingly.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='475'>This did not please the turtle; but he knew it was no use talking, so all he answered was:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='476'>"I shall go to war and take some captives, and I shall be away several months. And when I return I shall expect you to be ready to marry me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='477'>So he went back to his hut, and at once set about his preparations. The first thing he did was to call all his relations together, and ask them if they would come with him and make war on the people of a neighbouring village. The turtles, who were tired of doing nothing, agreed at once, and next day the whole tribe left the camp. The girl was standing at the door of her hut as they passed, and laughed out loud--they moved so slowly. Her lover, who was marching at the head, grew very angry at this, and cried out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='478'>"In four days from now you will be weeping instead of laughing, because there will be hundreds of miles between you and me."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='480'>"Oh, I did not mean four days, but four YEARS," answered the turtle, hastily; "whatever happens I shall be back by then."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='481'>The army marched on, till one day, when they felt as if they must have got half round the earth, though they were scarcely four miles from the camp, they found a large tree lying across their path. They looked at it with dismay, and the oldest among them put their heads together to see what was to be done.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='482'>"Can"t we manage to get past by the top?" asked one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='483'>"Why, it would take us YEARS," exclaimed another. "Just look at all those tall green branches, spreading in every direction. If once we got entangled in THEM, we should never get out again!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='484'>"Well then, let us go round by the bottom," said a third.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='485'>"How are we to do that, when the roots have made a deep hole, and above that is a high bank?" replied a fourth. "No; the only way I can think of, is to burn a large hole in the trunk." And this they did, but the trunk was very thick, and would not burn through.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='486'>"It is no use, we must give it up," they agreed at last. "After all, nobody need ever know! We have been away such a long while that we might easily have had all sorts of adventures." And so the whole company turned homewards again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='487'>They took even longer to go back than they had to come, for they were tired and footsore with their journey. When they drew near the camp they plucked up their courage, and began to sing a war-song. At this the villagers came flocking to see what spoils the turtles had won, but, as they approached, each turtle seized some one by the wrist, exclaiming: "You are our spoils; you are our prisoners!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='488'>"Now that I have got you I will keep you," said the leader, who had happened to seize his betrothed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='489'>Everybody was naturally very angry at this behaviour, and the girl most of all, and in her secret heart she determined to have her revenge. But, just at present, the turtles were too strong, so the prisoners had to put on their smartest slippers and their brightest clothes, and dance a war dance while the turtles sang. They danced so long that it seemed as if they would never stop, till the turtle who was leading the singing suddenly broke into a loud chant:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='490'>Whoever comes here, will die, will die!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='491'>At this all the dancers grew so frightened that they burst through the ring of their captors, and ran back to the village, the turtles following--very slowly.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='494'>But as soon as the villager was out of sight the turtle stopped, and taking a bundle containing fringes and ornaments from his back, he hung them about him, so that they rattled as he walked.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='497'>"Leave that to me; I will manage him," replied the wife, and at that moment the turtle came in, and seized her by the wrist. "Come with me," he said sternly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='498'>"You broke your promise," answered she. "You said you would be back soon, and it is more than a year since you went! How was I to know that you were alive?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='499'>At her words the husband took courage, and spoke hastily:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='501'>"I DID go, and made many prisoners," retorted the turtle angrily, drawing out his knife. "Look here, if she won"t be MY wife, she sha"n"t be YOURS. I will cut her in two; and you shall have one half, and I the other."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='502'>"But half a woman is no use to me," answered the man. "If you want her so much you had better take her." And the turtle, followed by his relations, carried her off to his own hut.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>Now the woman saw she would gain nothing by being sulky, so she pretended to be very glad to have got rid of her husband; but all the while she was trying to invent a plan to deliver herself from the turtle. At length she remembered that one of her friends had a large iron pot, and when the turtle had gone to his room to put away his fringes, she ran over to her neighbour"s and brought it back. Then she filled it with water and hung it over the fire to boil. It was just beginning to bubble and hiss when the turtle entered.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='522'>Full of joy Rosald rode off, and the next day he and Geirald started off to seek adventures.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='523'>They had not gone very far, when, riding across a mountain, they caught a glimpse of several armed men hiding amongst some trees in their path, and remembered suddenly some talk they had heard of a band of twelve robbers who lay in wait for rich travellers. The robbers were more like savage beasts than men, and lived somewhere at the top of the mountain in caves and holes in the ground. They were all called "Hankur," and were distinguished one from another by the name of a colour--blue, grey, red, and so on, except their chief, who was known as Hankur the Tall. All this and more rushed into the minds of the two young men as they saw the flash of their swords in the moonlight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='524'>"It is impossible to fight them--they are twelve to two," whispered Geirald, stopping his horse in the path. "We had much better ride back and take the lower road. It would be stupid to throw away our lives like this."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='525'>"Oh, we can"t turn back," answered Rosald, "we should be ashamed to look anyone in the face again! And, besides, it is a grand opportunity to show what we are made of. Let us tie up our horses here, and climb up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;stone' adjectives='' verbs='tie;climb;let;roll' valence='5.70125' arousal='3.41875' dominance='5.8275'>the rocks</entity> so that we can roll stones down on them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='526'>"Well, we might try that, and then we shall always have our horses," said Geirald. So they went up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='go' valence='6.02' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.295'>the rocks</entity> silently and carefully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='527'>The robbers were lying all ready, expecting every moment to see their victims coming round the corner a few yards away, when a shower of huge stones fell on their heads, killing half the band. The others sprang up the rock, but as they reached the top the sword of Rosald swung round, and one man after another rolled down into the valley. At last the chief managed to spring up, and, grasping Rosald by the waist, flung away his sword, and the two fought desperately, their bodies swaying always nearer the edge. It seemed as if Rosald, being the smaller of the two, MUST fall over, when, with his left hand, he drew the robber"s sword out of its sheath and plunged it into his heart. Then he took from the dead man a beautiful ring set with a large stone, and put it on his own finger.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='528'>The fame of this wonderful deed soon spread through the country, and people would often stop Geirald"s horse, and ask leave to see the robber"s ring, which was said to have been stolen from the father of the reigning king.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='529'>In a few days they left the kingdom and rode on to another, where they thought they would stop through the remainder of the winter, for Geirald liked to be comfortable, and did not care about travelling through ice and snow. But the king would only grant them leave to stop on condition that, before the winter was ended, they should give him some fresh proof of the courage of which he had heard so much. Rosald"s heart was glad at the king"s message, and as for Geirald, he felt that as long as Rosald was there all would go well. So they both bowed low and replied that it was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s' adjectives='low' verbs='be;obey;command;bow;place;reply' valence='5.37333333333' arousal='3.85' dominance='5.56111111111'>the king</entity>"s place to command and theirs to obey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='530'>"Well, then," said his Majesty, "this is what I want you to do: In the north-east part of my kingdom there dwells a giant, who has an iron staff twenty yards long, and he is so quick in using it, that even fifty knights have no chance against him. The bravest and strongest young men of my court have fallen under the blows of that staff; but, as you overcame the twelve robbers so easily, I feel that I have reason to hope that you may be able to conquer the giant. In three days from this you will set out."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='531'>"We will be ready, your Majesty," answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='majesty' adjectives='ready;silent' verbs='answer;be;remain' valence='5.98857142857' arousal='3.62' dominance='6.35714285714'>Rosald</entity>; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='majesty' adjectives='ready;silent' verbs='answer;be;remain' valence='5.98857142857' arousal='3.62' dominance='6.35714285714'>Geirald</entity> remained silent.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='532'>"How can we possibly fight against a giant that has killed fifty knights?" cried Geirald, when they were outside the castle. "The king only wants to get rid of us! He won"t think about us for the next three days--that is one comfort--so we shall have plenty of time to cross the borders of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='comfort;reach;t;plenty;time;border' adjectives='' verbs='cross;win;think;have;be' valence='6.02' arousal='3.6875' dominance='5.7075'>the kingdom</entity> and be out of reach."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='533'>"We mayn"t be able to kill the giant, but we certainly can"t run away till we have tried," answered Rosald. "Besides, think how glorious it will be if we DO manage to kill him! I know what sort of weapon I shall use. Come with me now, and I will see about it." And, taking his friend by the arm, he led him into a shop where he bought a huge lump of solid iron, so big that they could hardly lift it between them. However, they just managed to carry it to a blacksmith"s where Rosald directed that it should be beaten into a thick club, with a sharp spike at one end. When this was done to his liking he took it home under his arm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='534'>Very early on the third morning the two young men started on their journey, and on the fourth day they reached the giant"s cave before he was out of bed. Hearing the sound of footsteps, the giant got up and went to the entrance to see who was coming, and Rosald, expecting something of the sort, struck him such a blow on the forehead that he fell to the ground. Then, before he could rise to his feet again, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='foot;head;sword' adjectives='' verbs='cut;draw;rise' valence='5.27' arousal='4.52333333333' dominance='5.935'>Rosald</entity> drew out his sword and cut off his head.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='542'>"The honour will be all the higher if we gain the day," answered Rosald; but Geirald would listen to nothing, and only declared that he did not care about honour, and would rather be alive than have every honour in the world heaped upon him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='543'>Rosald was much grieved when he heard these words, but he knew that it was useless attempting to persuade Geirald, and turned his thoughts to forming some plan to prevent this disgraceful flight. Suddenly his face brightened. "Let us change clothes," he said, "and I will do the fighting, while you shall get the glory. Nobody will ever know." And to this Geirald readily consented.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='544'>Whether Geirald was right or not in thinking that the so-called page was really a well-proved knight, it is certain that Rosald"s task was a very hard one. Three times they came together with a crash which made their horses reel; once Rosald knocked the helmet off his foe, and received in return such a blow that he staggered in his saddle. Shouts went up from the lookers-on, as first one and then the other seemed gaining the victory; but at length Rosald planted his spear in the armour which covered his adversary"s breast and bore him steadily backward.

And he turned towards the queen, who had not been present during the fight, but had just slipped into a seat by his right hand. Now the queen"s eyes were very sharp, and it seemed to her that the man who stood before her, tall and handsome though he might be, was different in many slight ways, and in one in particular, from the man who had fought the tourney. How there could be any trickery she could not understand, and why the real victor should be willing to give up his prize to another was still stranger; but something in her heart warned her to be careful. She answered: "You may be satisfied, uncle, but I am not. One more proof I must have; let the two young men now fight against each other. The man I marry must be the man who killed the robbers and the giant, and overcame my page." Geirald"s face grew pale as he heard these words. He knew there was no escape from him now, though he did not doubt for one moment that Rosald would keep his compact loyally to the last.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='549'>The tourney was fought, and in spite of Geirald"s fears Rosald managed to hang back to make attacks which were never meant to succeed, and to allow strokes which he could easily have parried to attain their end.

And as he fell he knew that it was not alone the glory that was his rightfully which he gave up, but the hand of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rightfully;glory;hand' adjectives='precious' verbs='be;give;know;fall' valence='6.04909090909' arousal='4.12' dominance='5.52'>the queen</entity> that was more precious still.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='621'>At this moment the second brother came up--for the mountain had been left open on purpose to tempt him also--and cried out breathlessly: "Don"t you see that the bear is lying close to you? Why don"t you shoot him?" And, without waiting for a reply, pressed forward to drive his arrow into the heart of the bear. But the elder one caught his raised arm, and whispered: "Be quiet! can"t you tell where you are?" Then the boy looked up and saw the angry bears about him. On the one side were the servants of the chief, and on the other the servants of the chief"s sister, who was sorry for the two youths, and begged that their lives might be spared. The chief answered that he would not kill them, but only cast a spell over them, by which their heads and bodies should remain as they were, but their arms and legs should change into those of a bear, so that they would go on all fours for the rest of their lives. And, stooping over a spring of water, he dipped a handful of moss in it and rubbed it over the arms and legs of the boys. In an instant the transformation took place, and two creatures, neither beast nor human stood before the chief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='622'>Now the bear chief of course knew that the boys" father would seek for his sons when they did not return home, so he sent another of his servants to the hiding-place at the fork of the trail to see what would happen. He had not waited long, when the father came in sight, stooping as he went to look for his sons" tracks in the snow. When he saw the marks of snow-shoes along the path on the right he was filled with joy, not knowing that the servant had made some fresh tracks on purpose to mislead him; and he hastened forward so fast that he fell headlong into a pit, where the bear was sitting. Before he could pick himself up the bear had quietly broken his neck, and, hiding the body under the snow, sat down to see if anyone else would pass that way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='623'>Meanwhile the mother at home was wondering what had become of her two sons, and as the hours went on, and their father never returned, she made up her mind to go and look for him. The youngest boy begged her to let him undertake the search, but she would not hear of it, and told him he must stay at home and take care of his sister. So, slipping on her snow-shoes, she started on her way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='624'>As no fresh snow had fallen, the trail was quite easy to find, and she walked straight on, till it led her up to the pit where the bear was waiting for her. He grasped her as she fell and broke her neck, after which he laid her in the snow beside her husband, and went back to tell the bear chief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='625'>Hour after hour dragged heavily by in the forest hut, and at last the brother and sister felt quite sure that in some way or other all the rest of the family had perished. Day after day the boy climbed to the top of a tall tree near the house, and sat there till he was almost frozen, looking on all sides through the forest openings, hoping that he might see someone coming along. Very soon all the food in the house was eaten, and he knew he would have to go out and hunt for more. Besides, he wished to seek for his parents.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='626'>The little girl did not like being left alone in the hut, and cried bitterly; but her brother told her that there was no use sitting down quietly to starve, and that whether he found any game or not he would certainly be back before the following night. Then he cut himself some arrows, each from a different tree, and winged with the feathers of four different birds. He then made himself a bow, very light and strong, and got down his snow-shoes. All this took some time, and he could not start that day, but early next morning he called his little dog Redmouth, whom he kept in a box, and set out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='627'>After he had followed the trail for a great distance he grew very tired, and sat upon the branch of a tree to rest. But Redmouth barked so furiously that the boy thought that perhaps his parents might have been killed under its branches, and stepping back, shot one of his arrows at the root of the tree. Whereupon a noise like thunder shook it from top to bottom, fire broke out, and in a few minutes a little heap of ashes lay in the place where it had stood.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='629'>Now, as was plain by his being able to change the shape of the two brothers, the bear chief knew a good deal of magic, and he was quite aware that the little boy was following the trail, and he sent a very small but clever bear servant to wait for him in the bushes and to try to tempt him into the mountain. But somehow his spells could not have worked properly that day, as the bear chief did not know that Redmouth had gone with his master, or he would have been more careful. For the moment the dog ran round the bushes barking loudly, the little bear servant rushed out in a fright, and set out for the mountains as fast as he could.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='630'>The dog followed the bear, and the boy followed the dog, until the mountain, the house of the great bear chief, came in sight. But along the road the snow was so wet and heavy that the boy could hardly get along, and then the thong of his snow-shoes broke, and he had to stop and mend it, so that the bear and the dog got so far ahead that he could scarcely hear the barking. When the strap was firm again <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='snow-shoe;strap' adjectives='firm' verbs='be;say;speak' valence='5.71666666667' arousal='4.115' dominance='6.01'>the boy</entity> spoke to his snow-shoes and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='633'>The little brother was certainly very much puzzled at not seeing anything of either of the animals, which had vanished suddenly out of his sight. He paused for an instant to think what he should do next, and while he did so he fancied he heard Redmouth"s voice on the opposite side of the mountain. With great difficulty he scrambled over steep rocks, and forced a path through tangled thickets; but when he reached the other side the sound appeared to start from the place from which he had come. Then he had to go all <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='instant' adjectives='top' verbs='be;stop;rest;know;have;go;bark;happen' valence='5.84533333333' arousal='3.62733333333' dominance='5.484'>the way</entity> back again, and at the very top, where he stopped to rest, the barking was directly beneath him, and he knew in an instant where he was and what had happened.</paragraph>

Then the wolverine went up close, and struck the rock a blow with his paw, saying: "Well, will you catch me NOW?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='737'>"I can"t walk, but I can ROLL," answered the rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='738'>And the wolverine laughed and said: "Oh, that will do just as well"; and began to run down the side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wolverine;side' adjectives='' verbs='do;say;run;begin;laugh' valence='6.04555555556' arousal='4.23777777778' dominance='6.17444444444'>the mountain</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='739'>At first he went quite slowly, "just to give the rock a chance," he thought to himself; but soon he quickened his pace, for he found that the rock was almost at his heels. But the faster the wolverine ran, the faster the rock rolled, and by-and-by the little creature began to get very tired, and was sorry he had not left the rock to itself. Thinking that if he could manage to put on a spurt he would reach the forest of great trees at the bottom of the mountain, where the rock could not come, he gathered up all his strength, and instead of running he leaped over sticks and stones, but, whatever he did, the rock was always close behind him. At length he grew so weary that he could not even see where he was going, and catching his foot in a branch he tripped and fell. The rock stopped at once, but there came a shriek from the wolverine:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='740'>"Get off, get off! can"t you see that you are on my legs?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='741'>"Why did you not leave me alone?" asked the rock. "I did not want to move--I hate moving. But you WOULD have it, and I certainly sha"n"t move now till I am forced to."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='742'>"I will call my brothers," answered the wolverine. "There are many of them in the forest, and you will soon see that they are stronger than you." And he called, and called, and called, till wolves and foxes and all sorts of other creatures all came running to see what was the matter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='743'>"How DID you get under that rock?" asked they, making a ring round him; but they had to repeat their question several times before the wolverine would answer, for he, like many other persons, found it hard to confess that he had brought his troubles on himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='744'>"Well, I was dull, and wanted someone to play with me," he said at last, in sulky voice, "and I challenged the rock to catch me. Of course I thought I could run the fastest; but I tripped, and it rolled on me. It was just an accident."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='745'>"It serves you right for being so silly," said they; but they pushed and hauled at the rock for a long time without making it move an inch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='746'>"You are no good at all," cried the wolverine crossly, for it was suffering great pain, "and if you cannot get me free, I shall see what my friends the lightning and thunder can do." And he called loudly to the lightning to come and help him as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='747'>In a few minutes a dark cloud came rolling up the sky, giving out such terrific claps of thunder that the wolves and the foxes and all the other creatures ran helter-skelter in all directions. But, frightened though they were, they did not forget to beg the lightning to take off the wolverine"s coat and to free his legs, but to be careful not to hurt him. So the lightning disappeared into the cloud for a moment to gather up fresh strength, and then came rushing down, right upon the rock, which it sent flying in all directions, and took the wolverine"s coat so neatly that, though it was torn into tiny shreds, the wolverine himself was quite unharmed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='748'>"That was rather clumsy of you," said he, standing up naked in his flesh. "Surely you could have split the rock without tearing my coat to bits!" And he stooped down to pick up the pieces. It took him a long time, for there were a great many of them, but at last he had them all in his hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='749'>"I"ll go to my sister the frog," he thought to himself, "and she will sew them together for me"; and he set off at once for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ll;sister;frog' adjectives='' verbs='go;sew;live;set;think' valence='5.95916666667' arousal='4.1' dominance='5.58083333333'>the swamp</entity> in which his sister lived.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='750'>"Will you sew my coat together? I had an unlucky accident, and it is quite impossible to wear," he said, when he found her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='751'>"With pleasure," she answered, for she had always been taught to be polite; and getting her needle and thread she began to fit the pieces. But though she was very good-natured, she was not very clever, and she got some of the bits wrong. When the wolverine, who was very particular about his clothes, came to put it on, he grew very angry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='752'>"What a useless creature you are!" cried he. "Do you expect me to go about in such a coat as that? Why it bulges all down the back, as if I had a hump, and it is so tight across the chest that I expect it to burst every time I breathe. I knew you were stupid, but I did not think you were as stupid as that." And giving the poor frog a blow on her head, which knocked her straight into the water, he walked off in a rage to his younger sister the mouse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='753'>"I tore my coat this morning," he began, when he had found her sitting at the door of her house eating an apple. "It was all in little bits, and I took it to our sister the frog to ask her to sew it for me. But just look at the way she has done it! You will have to take it to pieces and fit them together properly, and I hope I shall not have to complain again." For as the wolverine was older than the mouse, he was accustomed to speak to her in this manner. However, the mouse was used to it and only answered: "I think you had better stay here till it is done, and if there is any alteration needed I can make it." So the wolverine sat down on a heap of dry ferns, and picking up the apple, he finished it without even asking the mouse"s leave.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='754'>At last the coat was ready, and the wolverine put it on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='755'>"Yes, it fits very well," said he, "and you have sewn it very neatly. When I pass this way again I will bring you a handful of corn, as a reward"; and he ran off as smart as ever, leaving the mouse quite grateful behind him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='756'>He wandered about for many days, till he reached a place where food was very scarce, and for a whole week he went without any. He was growing desperate, when he suddenly came upon a bear that was lying asleep. "Ah! here is food at last!" thought he; but how was he to kill the bear, who was so much bigger than himself? It was no use to try force, he must invent some cunning plan which would get her into his power. At last, after thinking hard, he decided upon something, and going up to the bear, he exclaimed: "Is that you, my sister?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='757'>The bear turned round and saw the wolverine, and murmuring to herself, so low that nobody could hear, "I never heard before that I had a brother," got up and ran quickly to a tree, up which she climbed. Now the wolverine was very angry when he saw his dinner vanishing in front of him, especially as HE could not climb trees like the bear, so he followed, and stood at the foot of the tree, shrieking as loud as he could, "Come down, sister; our father has sent me to look for you! You were lost when you were a little girl and went out picking berries, and it was only the other day that we heard from a beaver where you were." At these words, the bear came a little way down <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wolverine;word;way;bear' adjectives='little' verbs='go;see;come' valence='5.913' arousal='4.077' dominance='5.289'>the tree</entity>, and the wolverine, seeing this, went on:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='758'>"Are you not fond of berries? I am! And I know a place where they grow so thick the ground is quite hidden. Why, look for yourself! That hillside is quite red with them!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='759'>"I can"t see so far," answered the bear, now climbing down altogether. "You must have wonderfully good eyes! I wish I had; but my sight is very short."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='760'>"So was mine till my father smashed a pailful of cranberries, and rubbed my eyes with them," replied the wolverine. "But if you like to go and gather some of the berries I will do just as he did, and you will soon be able to see as far as me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='761'>It took the bear a long while to gather the berries, for she was slow about everything, and, besides, it made her back ache to stoop. But at last she returned with a sackful, and put them down beside the wolverine. "That is splendid, sister!" cried the wolverine. "Now lie flat on the ground with your head on this stone, while I smash them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='762'>The bear, who was very tired, was only too glad to do as she was bid, and stretched herself comfortably on the grass.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='763'>"I am ready now," said the wolverine after a bit; "just at first you will find that the berries make your eyes smart, but you must be careful not to move, or the juice will run out, and then it will have to be done all over again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='764'>So the bear promised to lie very still; but the moment the cranberries touched her eyes she sprang up with a roar.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='765'>"Oh, you mustn"t mind a little pain," said the wolverine, "it will soon be over, and then you will see all sorts of things you have never dreamt of." The bear sank down with a groan, and as her eyes were full of cranberry juice, which completely blinded her, the wolverine took up a sharp knife and stabbed her to the heart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='766'>Then he took off the skin, and, stealing some fire from a tent, which his sharp eyes had perceived hidden behind a rock, he set about roasting the bear bit by bit. He thought the meat was the best he ever had tasted, and when dinner was done he made up his mind to try that same trick again, if ever he was hungry.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='771'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='772'>Once upon a time there lived in Japan a rat and his wife who came of an old and noble race, and had one daughter, the loveliest girl in all the rat world. Her parents were very proud of her, and spared no pains to teach her all she ought to know. There was not another young lady in the whole town who was as clever as she was in gnawing through the hardest wood, or who could drop from such a height on to a bed, or run away so fast if anyone was heard coming. Great attention, too, was paid to her personal appearance, and her skin shone like satin, while her teeth were as white as pearls, and beautifully pointed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='773'>Of course, with all these advantages, her parents expected her to make a brilliant marriage, and, as she grew up, they began to look round for a suitable husband.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='774'>But here a difficulty arose. The father was a rat from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail, outside as well as in, and desired that his daughter should wed among her own people. She had no lack of lovers, but her father"s secret hopes rested on a fine young rat, with moustaches which almost swept the ground, whose family was still nobler and more ancient than his own. Unluckily, the mother had other views for her precious child. She was one of those people who always despise their own family and surroundings, and take pleasure in thinking that they themselves are made of finer material than the rest of the world. "HER daughter should never marry a mere rat," she declared, holding her head high. "With her beauty and talents she had a right to look for someone a little better than THAT."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='775'>So she talked, as mothers will, to anyone that would listen to her. What <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='matter;rat;nobody;fashion;world' adjectives='' verbs='be;care;think;know' valence='6.14444444444' arousal='4.27555555556' dominance='5.49444444444'>the girl</entity> thought about the matter nobody knew or cared--it was not the fashion in the rat world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='776'>Many were the quarrels which the old rat and his wife had upon the subject, and sometimes they bore on their faces certain marks which looked as if they had not kept to words only.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='777'>"Reach up to the stars is MY motto," cried the lady one day, when she was in a greater passion than usual. "My daughter"s beauty places her higher than anything upon earth," she cried; "and I am certainly not going to accept a son-in-law who is beneath her."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='778'>"Better offer her in marriage to the sun," answered her husband impatiently. "As far as I know there is nothing greater than he."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='779'>"Well, I WAS thinking of it," replied the wife, "and as you are of the same mind, we will pay him a visit to-morrow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='780'>So the next morning, the two rats, having spent hours in making themselves smart, set out to see the sun, leading their daughter between them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='781'>The journey took some time, but at length they came to the golden palace where the sun lived.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='782'>"Noble king," began the mother, "behold our daughter! She is so beautiful that she is above everything in the whole world. Naturally, we wish for a son-in-law who, on his side, is greater than all. Therefore we have come to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='783'>"I feel very much flattered," replied the sun, who was so busy that he had not the least wish to marry anybody. "You do me great honour by your proposal. Only, in one point you are mistaken, and it would be wrong of me to take advantage of your ignorance. There is something greater than I am, and that is the cloud. Look!" And as he spoke a cloud spread itself over the sun"s face, blotting out his rays.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='784'>"Oh, well, we will speak to the cloud," said the mother. And turning to the cloud she repeated her proposal.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='785'>"Indeed I am unworthy of anything so charming," answered the cloud; "but you make a mistake again in what you say. There is one thing that is even more powerful than I, and that is the wind. Ah, here he comes, you can see for yourself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='786'>And she DID see, for catching up the cloud as he passed, he threw it on the other side of the sky.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='787'>When she had recovered her breath, the mother began her little speech once more.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='788'>"The wall is the proper husband for your daughter," answered the wind, whose home consisted of a cave, which he only visited when he was not rushing about elsewhere; "you can see for yourself that he is greater than I, for he has power to stop me in my flight."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='789'>Then something happened which was quite unexpected by everyone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='790'>"I won"t marry that ugly old wall, which is as old as my grandfather," sobbed the girl, who had not uttered one word all this time. "I would have married the sun, or the cloud, or the wind, because it was my duty, although I love the handsome young rat, and him only. But that horrid old wall--I would sooner die!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='791'>And <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='claim;girl;feeling;husband' adjectives='beautiful' verbs='be;declare;have;hurt' valence='5.79909090909' arousal='4.27727272727' dominance='5.45636363636'>the wall</entity>, rather hurt in his feelings, declared that he had no claim to be the husband of so beautiful a girl.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='792'>"It is quite true," he said, "that I can stop the wind who can part the clouds who can cover the sun; but there is someone who can do more than all these, and that is the rat.

If, therefore, you want a son-in-law who is greater than the whole world, seek him among the rats."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='793'>"Ah, what did I tell you?" cried the father. And his wife, though for the moment angry at being beaten, soon thought that a rat son-in-law was what she had always desired.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='799'>Long, long ago, there lived a king who ruled over a country by the sea.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='800'>The vessel had not gone very far when she ran upon a rock, and stuck so fast in a cleft that the strength of the whole crew could not get her off again. To make matters worse, the wind was rising too, and it was quite plain that in a few hours the ship would be dashed to pieces and everybody would be drowned, when suddenly the form of a mermaid was seen dancing on the waves which threatened every moment to overwhelm them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='801'>"There is only one way to free yourselves," she said to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='water;yourselve;word;way;child' adjectives='solemn;free' verbs='be;give;deliver;bear;say;bob;speak' valence='6.2475' arousal='4.0635' dominance='5.719'>the king</entity>, bobbing up and down in the water as she spoke, "and that is to give me your solemn word that you will deliver to me the first child that is born to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='802'>The king hesitated at this proposal. He hoped that some day he might have children in his home, and the thought that he must yield up the heir to his crown was very bitter to him; but just then a huge wave broke with great force on the ship"s side, and his men fell on their knees and entreated him to save them.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='804'>The affairs of the islands took longer to settle than the king had expected, and some months passed away before he returned to his palace. In his absence a son had been born to him, and so great was his joy that he quite forgot the mermaid and the price he had paid for the safety of his ship. But as the years went on, and the baby grew into a fine big boy, the remembrance of it came back, and one day he told the queen the whole story. From that moment the happiness of both their lives was ruined. Every night they went to bed wondering if they should find his room empty in the morning, and every day they kept him by their sides, expecting him to be snatched away before their very eyes.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='806'>"After all, the most foolish thing in the world one can do is to keep the boy here in exactly the place in which the mermaid will seek him.

He began busily to make his preparations, and took off his smart velvet coat, putting on instead one of green cloth, while he refused a beautiful bag which the queen offered him to hold his food, and slung a leather knapsack over his shoulders instead, just as he had seen other travellers do.

"We will have supper together," he remarked politely; but the bear, who had never been taught manners, made no reply, and ate as fast as he could. When he had quite finished, he got up and stretched himself.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='824'>"I wonder how it feels to be a bear," thought he to himself when he had walked a little way; and he took out the tip from the breast of his coat and wished hard that he might become a bear. The next moment his body stretched out and thick black fur covered him all over. As before, his hands were changed into paws, but when he tried to switch his tail he found to his disgust that it would not go any distance. "Why it is hardly worth calling a tail!" said he. For the rest of the day he remained a bear and continued his journey, but as evening came on the bear-skin, which had been so useful when plunging through brambles in the forest, felt rather heavy, and he wished himself a boy again. He was too much exhausted to take the trouble of cutting any fern or seeking for moss, but just threw himself down under a tree, when exactly above his head he heard a great buzzing as a bumble-bee alighted on a honeysuckle branch. "What are you doing here?" asked the bee in a cross voice; "at your age you ought to be safe at home."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='825'>"I am running away from the mermaid," replied the boy; but the bee, like the lion and the bear, was one of those people who never listen to the answers to their questions, and only said: "I am hungry. Give me something to eat."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='826'>The boy took his last loaf and flask out of his knapsack and laid them on the ground, and they had supper together. "Well, now I am going to sleep," observed the bee when the last crumb was gone, "but as you are not very big I can make room for you beside me," and he curled up his wings, and tucked in his legs, and he and the prince both slept soundly till morning.

"I dare say I should get on a great deal faster," so he pulled out his hair and wished himself a bee.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='829'>In a moment the strangest thing happened to him. All his limbs seemed to draw together, and his body to become very short and round; his head grew quite tiny, and instead of his white skin he was covered with the richest, softest velvet.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='830'>Late in the afternoon the boy fancied he saw a vast heap of stones a long way off, and he flew straight towards it.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='831'>He found the palace doors wide open and went boldly into a sort of hall which was full of people, and where men and maids were gossiping together. He joined their talk and soon learned from them that the king had only one daughter who had such a hatred to men that she would never suffer one to enter her presence. Her father was in despair, and had had pictures painted of the handsomest princes of all the courts in the world, in the hope that she might fall in love with one of them; but it was no use; <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='picture;use;court;room;love;father;despair;world;prince;hope' adjectives='handsomest' verbs='be;have;paint;bring;allow;fall' valence='6.00695652174' arousal='4.0947826087' dominance='5.51913043478'>the princess</entity> would not even allow the pictures to be brought into her room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='832'>"It is late," remarked one of the women at last; "I must go to my mistress." And, turning to one of the lackeys, she bade him find a bed for the youth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='833'>"It is not necessary," answered the prince, "this bench is good enough for me. I am used to nothing better." And when the hall was empty he lay down for a few minutes. But as soon as everything was quiet in the palace he took out the hair and wished himself a bee, and in this shape he flew upstairs, past the guards, and through the keyhole into the princess"s chamber. Then he turned himself into a man again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='834'>At this dreadful sight the princess, who was broad awake, began to scream loudly. "A man! a man!" cried she; but when the guards rushed in there was only a bumble-bee buzzing about the room. They looked under the bed, and behind the curtains, and into the cupboards, then came to the conclusion that the princess had had a bad dream, and bowed themselves out. <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='youth;place;bee' adjectives='handsome' verbs='close;disappear;have;stand' valence='5.411' arousal='4.069' dominance='5.714'>The door</entity> had scarcely closed on them than the bee disappeared, and a handsome youth stood in his place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='835'>"I knew a man was hidden somewhere," cried the princess, and screamed more loudly than before.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='836'>"He was here a moment ago--I saw him with my own eyes," and the guards dared not contradict her, though they shook their heads and whispered to each other that the princess had gone mad on this subject, and saw a man in every table and chair. And they made up their minds that--let her scream as loudly as she might--they would take no notice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='837'>Now the princess saw clearly what they were thinking, and that in future her guards would give her no help, and would perhaps, besides, tell some stories about her to the king, who would shut her up in a lonely tower and prevent her walking in the gardens among her birds and flowers.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='838'>"Do not be afraid," he said, "I shall not hurt you"; and he began to praise her gardens, of which he had heard the servants speak, and the birds and flowers which she loved, till the princess"s anger softened, and she answered him with gentle words. Indeed, they soon became so friendly that she vowed she would marry no one else, and confided to him that in three days her father would be off to the wars, leaving his sword in her room. If any man could find it and bring it to him he would receive her hand as a reward.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='839'>Just as the princess had foretold, in three days the king set out for the war with a large following, and among them was the young prince, who had presented himself at court as a young noble in search of adventures.

But suddenly a better plan entered the prince"s head, and, letting the others pass him, he took his precious parcel from his breast and wished himself a lion. Then on he bounded, uttering such dreadful roars that the horses were frightened and grew unmanageable, and he easily outstripped them, and soon reached the gates of the palace. Here he hastily changed himself into a bee, and flew straight into the princess"s room, where he became a man again. She showed him where the sword hung concealed behind a curtain, and he took it down, saying as he did so: "Be sure not to forget what you have promised to do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='842'>The princess made no reply, but smiled sweetly, and slipping a golden ring from her finger she broke it in two and held half out silently to the prince, while the other half she put in her own pocket. He kissed it, and ran down the stairs bearing the sword with him. Some way off he met the Red Knight and the rest, and the Red Knight at first tried to take the sword from him by force. But as the youth proved too strong for him, he gave it up, and resolved to wait for a better opportunity.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='843'>This soon came, for the day was hot and the prince was thirsty. Perceiving a little stream that ran into the sea, he turned aside, and, unbuckling the sword, flung himself on the ground for a long drink. Unluckily, the mermaid happened at that moment to be floating on the water not very far off, and knew he was the boy who had been given her before he was born. So she floated gently in to where he was lying, she seized him by the arm, and the waves closed over them both. Hardly had they disappeared, when the Red Knight stole cautiously up, and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the king"s sword on the bank. He wondered what had become of the youth, who an hour before had guarded his treasure so fiercely; but, after all, that was no affair of his! So, fastening the sword to his belt, he carried it to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sword;belt' adjectives='' verbs='carry;fasten' valence='5.402' arousal='4.264' dominance='5.872'>the king</entity>.</paragraph>

But when the princess from her window saw that her betrothed was not among the attendants riding behind her father, her heart sank, for she knew that some evil must have befallen him, and she feared the Red Knight. She had long ago learned how clever and how wicked he was, and something whispered to her that it was he who would gain the credit of having carried back the sword, and would claim her as his bride, though he had never even entered her chamber. And she could do nothing; for although <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;plan' adjectives='' verbs='do;let;love;stand' valence='6.04714285714' arousal='3.75428571429' dominance='5.94571428571'>the king</entity> loved her, he never let her stand in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;plan' adjectives='' verbs='do;let;love;stand' valence='6.04714285714' arousal='3.75428571429' dominance='5.94571428571'>the way</entity> of his plans.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='846'>In those days feasts were much longer and more splendid than they are now; and it was growing dark when the princess, tired out with all she had gone through, stole up to her own room for a little quiet.

And as he spoke he put his hand into his breast, and seizing the hair wished himself a bee, and flew straight into the pocket of the princess. The mermaid looked in vain for him, and coated all night upon the sea; but he never came back, and never more did he gladden her eyes. But the princess felt that something strange was about her, though she knew not what, and returned quickly to the palace, where the young man at once resumed his own shape. Oh, what joy filled her heart at the sight of him! But there was no time to be lost, and she led him right into the hall, where the king and his nobles were still sitting at the feast. "Here is a man who boasts that he can do wonderful tricks," said she, "better even than the Red Knight"s! That cannot be true, of course, but it might be well to give this impostor a lesson. He pretends, for instance, that he can turn himself into a lion; but that I do not believe.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='855'>Now the Red Knight had never opened a book of magic in his life; but he was accustomed to think that he could do everything better than other people without any teaching at all.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='856'>"Well, perhaps it is very difficult to change into a lion. Make yourself a bear," said the princess.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='857'>"Try a bee," suggested she. "I have always read that anyone who can do magic at all can do that." And the old knight buzzed and hummed, but he remained a man and not a bee.</paragraph>

And in a moment such a fierce creature stood before them, that all the guests rushed out of the hall, treading each other underfoot in their fright. The lion sprang at the Red Knight, and would have torn him in pieces had not the princess held him back, and bidden him to change himself into a man again. And in a second a man took the place of the lion.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='931'>Once upon a time two young men living in a small village fell in love with the same girl. During the winter, it was all night except for an hour or so about noon, when the darkness seemed a little less dark, and then they used to see which of them could tempt her out for a sleigh ride with the Northern Lights flashing above them, or which could persuade her to come to a dance in some neighbouring barn. But when the spring began, and the light grew longer, the hearts of the villagers leapt at the sight of the sun, and a day was fixed for the boats to be brought out, and the great nets to be spread in the bays of some islands that lay a few miles to the north. Everybody went on this expedition, and the two young men and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everybody;man;expedition' adjectives='young' verbs='go' valence='6.33571428571' arousal='4.46142857143' dominance='5.4'>the girl</entity> went with them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='932'>They all sailed merrily across the sea chattering like a flock of magpies, or singing their favourite songs. And when they reached the shore, what an unpacking there was! For this was a noted fishing ground, and here they would live, in little wooden huts, till autumn and bad weather came round again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='933'>The maiden and the two young men happened to share the same hut with some friends, and fished daily from the same boat. And as time went on, one of the youths remarked that the girl took less notice of him than she did of his companion. At first he tried to think that he was dreaming, and for a long while he kept his eyes shut very tight to what he did not want to see, but in spite of his efforts, the truth managed to wriggle through, and then the young man gave up trying to deceive himself, and set about finding some way to get the better of his rival.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='934'>The plan that he hit upon could not be carried out for some months; but the longer the young man thought of it, the more pleased he was with it, so he made no sign of his feelings, and waited patiently till the moment came. This was the very day that they were all going to leave the islands, and sail back to the mainland for the winter. In the bustle and hurry of departure, the cunning fisherman contrived that their boat should be the last to put off, and when everything was ready, and the sails about to be set, he suddenly called out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='935'>"Oh, dear, what shall I do! I have left my best knife behind in the hut. Run, like a good fellow, and get it for me, while I raise the anchor and loosen the tiller."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='936'>Not thinking any harm, the youth jumped back on shore and made his way up the steep hank. At the door of the hut he stopped and looked back, then started and gazed in horror. The head of the boat stood out to sea, and he was left alone on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;sea;boat' adjectives='' verbs='leave;be;stand' valence='5.7425' arousal='3.82' dominance='5.41375'>the island</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='937'>Yes, there was no doubt of it--he was quite alone; and he had nothing to help him except the knife which his comrade had purposely dropped on the ledge of the window. For some minutes he was too stunned by the treachery of his friend to think about anything at all, but after a while he shook himself awake, and determined that he would manage to keep alive somehow, if it were only to revenge himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='938'>So he put the knife in his pocket and went off to a part of the island which was not so bare as the rest, and had a small grove of trees. From one of these he cut himself a bow, which he strung with a piece of cord that had been left lying about the huts.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='939'>When this was ready the young man ran down to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sea-bird;supper;man' adjectives='ready;young' verbs='shoot;be;cook;run;pluck' valence='5.81' arousal='4.14454545455' dominance='5.42363636364'>the shore</entity> and shot one or two sea-birds, which he plucked and cooked for supper.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='940'>In this way the months slipped by, and Christmas came round again. The evening before, the youth went down to the rocks and into the copse, collecting all the drift wood the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down, and he piled it up in a great stack outside the door, so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day. As soon as his task was done, he paused and looked out towards the mainland, thinking of Christmas Eve last year, and the merry dance they had had. The night was still and cold, and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast, when, suddenly, he noticed a boat, which seemed steering straight for the island. At first he could hardly stand for joy, the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful; but as the boat drew near there was something, he could not tell what, that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life, and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours. Then he hastily stepped behind <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='next' verbs='step;stack;happen;wait' valence='5.376' arousal='3.472' dominance='5.814'>the wood</entity> stack, and waited for what might happen next.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='941'>The strange folk one by one jumped on to the rocks, each bearing a load of something that they wanted. Among the women he remarked two young girls, more beautiful and better dressed than any of the rest, carrying between them two great baskets full of provisions. The young man peeped out cautiously to see what all this crowd could be doing inside the tiny hut, but in a moment he drew back again, as the girls returned, and looked about as if they wanted to find out what sort of a place <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sort;crowd;hut;moment;place;girl;man' adjectives='young;tiny' verbs='be;draw;return;look;do;see;want;peep;find' valence='5.74772727273' arousal='4.04272727273' dominance='5.66409090909'>the island</entity> was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='942'>Their sharp eyes soon discovered the form of a man crouching behind the bundles of sticks, and at first they felt a little frightened, and started as if they would run away.

"What a strange creature, let us try what he is made of," said one, and she stooped down and gave him a pinch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='943'>Now the young man had a pin sticking in the sleeve of his jacket, and the moment the girl"s hand touched him she pricked it so sharply that the blood came. The girl screamed so loudly that the people all ran out of their huts to see what was the matter. But directly they caught sight of the man they turned and fled in the other direction, and picking up the goods they had brought with them scampered as fast as they could down to the shore. In an instant, boat, people, and goods had vanished completely.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='948'>Then the young man gave her his promise to make her his wife, and the girl fulfilled her part of the bargain, and food was plentiful on the island all through the long winter months, though he never knew how it got there.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='951'>The girl replied that she would like to go somewhere right at the other end of the island, and build a house, far away from the huts of the fishing-folk. And he consented, and that very day they set off in search of a sheltered spot on the banks of a stream, so that it would be easy to get water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='952'>In a tiny bay, on the opposite side of the island they found the very thing, which seemed to have been made on purpose for them; and as they were tired with their long walk, they laid themselves down on a bank of moss among some birches and prepared to have a good night"s rest, so as to be fresh for work next day. But before she went to sleep <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='noise;dream;husband' adjectives='sure;strange;fancy' verbs='be;do;get;see;turn;say;sleep;go;hear;stir' valence='6.17777777778' arousal='4.07055555556' dominance='5.94055555556'>the girl</entity> turned to her husband, and said: "If in your dreams you fancy that you hear strange noises, be sure you do not stir, or get up to see what it is."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='953'>"Oh, it is not likely we shall hear any noises in such a quiet place," answered he, and fell sound asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='954'>Suddenly he was awakened by a great clatter about his ears, as if all the workmen in the world were sawing and hammering and building close to him. He was just going to spring up and go to see what it meant, when he luckily remembered his wife"s words and lay still. But the time till morning seemed very long, and with the first ray of sun they both rose, and pushed aside the branches of the birch trees. There, in the very place they had chosen, stood a beautiful house--doors and windows, and everything all complete!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='955'>"Now you must fix on a spot for your cow-stalls," said the girl, when they had breakfasted off wild cherries; "and take care it is the proper size, neither too large nor too small." And the husband did as he was bid, though he wondered what use a cow-house could be, as they had no cows to put in it. But as he was a little afraid of his wife, who knew so much more than he, he asked no questions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='956'>This night also he was awakened by the same sounds as before, and in the morning they found, near the stream, the most beautiful cow-house that ever was seen, with stalls and milk-pails and stools all complete, indeed, everything that a cow-house could possibly want, except the cows.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='957'>The old people welcomed them heartily, and summoned their neighbours, for many miles round, to a great feast in their honour. In fact, for several weeks there was no work done on the farm at all; and at length the young man and his wife grew tired of so much play, and declared that they must return to their own home. But, before they started on the journey, the wife whispered to her husband: "Take care to jump over the threshold as quick as you can, or it will be the worse for you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='958'>The young man listened to her words, and sprang over the threshold like an arrow from a bow; and it was well he did, for, no sooner was he on the other side, than his father-in-law threw a great hammer at him, which would have broken both his legs, if it had only touched them.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='960'>And the husband promised, and for a while all was still; and he thought no more about the matter till he noticed at last that the nearer he drew to the house the louder grew the noise of the trampling of feet behind him. As he laid his hand upon the door he thought he was safe, and turned to look. There, sure enough, was a vast herd of cattle, which had been sent after him by his father-in-law when he found that his daughter had been cleverer than he. Half of the herd were already through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;herd;grass;bank;half' adjectives='outside' verbs='be;remain;watch;fade;crop' valence='5.793' arousal='3.435' dominance='5.409'>the fence</entity> and cropping the grass on the banks of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;herd;grass;bank;half' adjectives='outside' verbs='be;remain;watch;fade;crop' valence='5.793' arousal='3.435' dominance='5.409'>the stream</entity>, but half still remained outside and faded into nothing, even as he watched them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='961'>However, enough cattle were left to make the young man rich, and he and his wife lived happily together, except that every now and then the girl vanished from his sight, and never told him where she had been. For a long time he kept silence about it; but one day, when he had been complaining of her absence, she said to him: "Dear husband, I am bound to go, even against my will, and there is only one way to stop me. Drive a nail into the threshold, and then I can never pass in or out."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='967'>Once upon a time there lived a miller who was so rich that, when he was going to be married, he asked to the feast not only his own friends but also the wild animals who dwelt in the hills and woods round about. The chief of the bears, the wolves, the foxes, the horses, the cows, the goats, the sheep, and the reindeer, all received invitations; and as they were not accustomed to weddings they were greatly pleased and flattered, and sent back messages in the politest language that they would certainly be there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='968'>The first to start on the morning of the wedding-day was the bear, who always liked to be punctual; and, besides, he had a long way to go, and his hair, being so thick and rough, needed a good brushing before it was fit to be seen at a party. However, he took care to awaken very early, and set off down the road with a light heart. Before he had walked very far he met a boy who came whistling along, hitting at the tops of the flowers with a stick.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='970'>"Oh, just to the miller"s marriage," answered the bear carelessly. "Of course, I would much rather stay at home, but the miller was so anxious I should be there that I really could not refuse."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='971'>"Don"t go, don"t go!" cried the boy. "If you do you will never come back! You have got the most beautiful skin in the world--just the kind that everyone is wanting, and they will be sure to kill you and strip you of it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='972'>"I had not thought of that," said the bear, whose face turned white, only nobody could see it. "If you are certain that they would be so wicked--but perhaps you are jealous because nobody has invited you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='973'>"Oh, nonsense!" replied the boy angrily, "do as you see. It is your skin, and not mine; I don"t care what becomes of it!" And he walked quickly on with his head in the air.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='977'>"Oh, just to the miller"s marriage," answered the wolf, as the bear had done before him. "It is rather tiresome, of course--weddings are always so stupid; but still one must be good-natured!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='986'>His tail had scarcely disappeared, when a great noise of crashing branches was heard, and up bounded the horse, his black skin glistening like satin.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='993'>But when he reached the miller"s house everything happened as the boy had said. While he was looking at the guests and thinking how much handsomer and stronger he was than any of them, a rope was suddenly flung over his head, and he was thrown down and a bit thrust between his teeth. Then, in spite of his struggles, he was dragged to a stable, and shut up for several days without any food, till his spirit was broken and his coat had lost its gloss.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='999'>"Oh, nonsense; what do you know about it?" answered the cow, who always thought she was wiser than other people. "Why, I can run twice as fast as any of them!

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1000'>But everything turned out just as the boy had said.

And he turned back for the second time and entered the chamber, while the hen wriggled herself free as before.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1161'>A few minutes later they arrived at the castle, and the fox, who had often been there before, slipped in without difficulty.

As soon as they saw the fox they cried out: "Come and dance too, old fox; it is a long time since we have seen you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1162'>So the fox stood up, and did his steps with the best of them; but after a while he stopped and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1164'>"Ah, that is delightful; we want something new," answered they, and placed the princess between the outstretched arms of the fox. In one instant he had knocked over the great stand of lights that lighted the hall, and in the darkness had borne the princess to the gate. His comrades seized hold of her, as they had been bidden, and the fox was back again in the hall before anyone had missed him. He found the giants busy trying to kindle a fire and get some light; but after a bit someone cried out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1165'>"Where is <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be' valence='6.91' arousal='4.425' dominance='5.62'>the princess</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1166'>"Here, in my arms," replied the fox. "Don"t be afraid; she is quite safe." And he waited until he thought that his comrades had gained a good start, and put at least five or six mountains between themselves and the giants. Then he sprang through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='maiden' adjectives='' verbs='go;spring;call;take;be' valence='6.07875' arousal='3.9975' dominance='5.67375'>the door</entity>, calling, as he went: "The maiden is here; take her if you can!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1167'>At these words the giants understood that their prize had escaped, and they ran after the fox as fast as their great legs could carry them, thinking that they should soon come up with the fox, who they supposed had the princess on his back. The fox, on his side, was far too clever to choose the same path that his friends had taken, but would in and out of the forest, till at last even HE was tired out, and fell fast asleep under a tree. Indeed, he was so exhausted with his day"s work that he never heard the approach of the giants, and their hands were already stretched out to seize his tail when his eyes opened, and with a tremendous bound he was once more beyond their reach. All the rest of the night the fox ran and ran; but when bright red spread over the east, he stopped and waited till the giants were close upon him. Then he turned, and said quietly: "Look, there is the Sister of the Sun!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1168'>The giants raised their eyes all at once, and were instantly turned into pillars of stone. The fox then made each pillar a low bow, and set off to join his friends.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1169'>He knew a great many short cuts across the hills, so it was not long before he came up with them, and all four travelled night and day till they reached the castle of the Sister of the Sun. What joy and feasting there was throughout the palace at the sight of the princess whom they had mourned as dead! and they could not make enough of the boy who had gone through such dangers in order to rescue her. The golden hen was given to him at once, and, more than that, the Sister of the Sun told him that, in a little time, when he was a few years older, she would herself pay a visit to his home and become his wife. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='star;darkness;light;forehead;world;ear;princess;store' adjectives='beautiful;thick' verbs='flee;be;believe;hear' valence='6.04777777778' arousal='4.07111111111' dominance='5.735'>The boy</entity> could hardly believe his ears when he heard what was in store for him, for his was the most beautiful princess in all the world; and however thick the darkness might be, it fled away at once from the light of a star on her forehead.</paragraph>

But, one by one, his comrades dropped off at the places where they had first met him, and he was quite alone when he reached his native town and the gates of the palace. With the golden hen under his arm he presented himself before the king, and told his adventures, and how he was going to have for a wife a princess so wonderful and unlike all other princesses, that the star on her forehead could turn night into day. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='story;cask;pitch' adjectives='true' verbs='be;do;throw;say;have;find;listen' valence='5.91705882353' arousal='4.04411764706' dominance='5.81235294118'>The king</entity> listened silently, and when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='story;cask;pitch' adjectives='true' verbs='be;do;throw;say;have;find;listen' valence='5.91705882353' arousal='4.04411764706' dominance='5.81235294118'>the boy</entity> had done, he said quietly: "If I find that your story is not true I will have you thrown into a cask of pitch."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1172'>But as the time drew near, and nothing was heard of the princess, the youth became anxious and uneasy, especially when it came to his ears that the great cask was being filled with pitch, and that sticks were laid underneath to make a fire to boil it with. All day long the boy stood at the window, looking over the sea by which the princess must travel; but there were no signs of her, not even the tiniest white sail. And, as he stood, soldiers came and laid hands on him, and led him up to the cask, where a big fire was blazing, and the horrid black pitch boiling and bubbling over the sides. He looked and shuddered, but there was no escape; so he shut his eyes to avoid seeing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1173'>The word was given for him to mount the steps which led to the top of the cask, when, suddenly, some men were seen running with all their might, crying as they went that a large ship with its sails spread was making straight for the city.

With this the bridal pair had to be content, and be as patient as they could till <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pair;arrival;s' adjectives='content;bridal;patient' verbs='be;have' valence='6.145' arousal='3.756' dominance='5.675'>the king</entity>"s arrival.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1190'>This sounded much more difficult than what he had done before, and he turned in despair to the Sister of the Sun.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1191'>"It is all right," she whispered encouragingly.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1193'>Now, surely, thought the princess, there was no longer any need to put off the wedding; and she gave orders that all should be ready for the following day. But again the old man interfered, and declared that without the king"s permission no marriage could take place. For the third time his majesty was sent for, and for the third time he proclaimed that he could not give his consent until the bridegroom should have slain a serpent which dwelt in a broad river that flowed at the back of the castle. Everyone knew stories of this terrible serpent, though no one had actually seen it; but from time to time a child strayed from home and never came back, and then mothers would forbid the other children to go near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='story;everyone;serpent;mother;time;fruit;flower;child;home;bank' adjectives='lovely;other;terrible;juicy' verbs='stray;forbid;see;know;have;time;go;come;grow' valence='5.91' arousal='3.95275862069' dominance='5.41448275862'>the river</entity>, which had juicy fruits and lovely flowers growing along its banks.</paragraph>

Go down to the river and unfasten a boat which lies moored there, and throw the chips into the water. When the serpent rears up its body you will cut off its three heads with one blow of your sword. Then take the tip of each tongue and go with it to-morrow morning into the king"s kitchen. If the king himself should enter, just say to him: "Here are three gifts I offer you in return for the services you demanded of me!" and throw the tips of the serpent"s tongues at him, and hasten to the ship as fast as your legs will carry you. But be sure you take great care never to look behind you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1196'>The young man did exactly what the princess had told him. The three chips which he flung into the river became a boat, and, as he steered across the stream, the serpent put up its head and hissed loudly. The youth had his sword ready, and in another second the three heads were bobbing on the water. Guiding his boat till he was beside them, he stooped down and snipped off the ends of the tongues, and then rowed back to the other bank. Next morning he carried them into the royal kitchen, and when the king entered, as was his custom, to see what he was going to have for dinner, the bridegroom flung them in his face, saying: "Here is a gift for you in return for the services you asked of me." And, opening the kitchen door, he fled to the ship. Unluckily he missed the way, and in his excitement ran backwards and forwards, without knowing whither he was going. At last, in despair, he looked round, and saw to his amazement that both the city and palace had vanished completely. Then he turned his eyes in the other direction, and, far, far away, he caught sight of the ship with her sails spread, and a fair wind behind her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1197'>This dreadful spectacle seemed to take away his senses, and all day long he wandered about, without knowing where he was going, till, in the evening, he noticed some smoke from a little hut of turf near by.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1200'>This advice surprised the young man a good deal, as he did not see how it could help him; but he did not answer, and went down the road without knowing where he was going.

After he had rustled the leaves only once all fatigue disappeared, and he strode over the grass till he came to another little turf hut.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1201'>"Let me in, I pray you, dear mother," cried he. And the door opened in front of him. "Your sister has sent you this letter," he said, and added quickly: "O mother! can you tell me anything of the Sister of the Sun?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1202'>"No, I know nothing of her," answered she. But as he turned hopelessly away, she stopped him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1209'>"Oh, it is ragged enough," answered they, "but it was left us by our father, and if any man wraps it round him no one can see him; and we each want it for our own."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1213'>"What is the matter?" asked he, stopping in front of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1214'>"If this cloth is spread on a table," answered they, "<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='food;cloth;table' adjectives='delicious' verbs='be;want;cover;spread;have;answer' valence='6.04307692308' arousal='3.90538461538' dominance='5.70538461538'>the table</entity> is instantly covered with the most delicious food; and we each want to have it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1216'>The two men were quite pleased with this idea, and handed him the cloth. He then hastily threw the first piece of stuff round his shoulders and vanished from sight, leaving the two men grieving over their own folly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1217'>The young man had not walked far before he saw two more men standing by the road-side, both grasping the same stout staff, and sometimes one seemed on the point of getting it, and sometimes the other.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1218'>"What are you quarrelling about? You could cut a dozen sticks from the wood each just as good as that!" said the young man. And as he spoke the fighters both stopped and looked at him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1219'>"Ah! you may think so," said one, "but a blow from one end of this stick will kill a man, while a touch from the other end will bring him back to life. You won"t easily find another stick like that!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1221'>The men were pleased with the idea, and handed him the staff.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1222'>"It is very curious, certainly," said he; "but which end is it that restores people to life?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1223'>At last he saw another set of men, who were struggling for the possession of a pair of shoes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1224'>"Why can"t you leave that pair of old shoes alone?" said he. "Why, you could not walk a yard in them!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1225'>"Yes, they are old enough," answered they; "but whoever puts them on and wishes himself at a particular place, gets there without going."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1226'>"That sounds very clever," said the youth. "Let me try them, and then I shall be able to tell you whose they ought to be."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1228'>"I wish to be in the castle on the Banka!" And before he knew it, he was there, and found the Sister of the Sun dying of grief. He knelt down by her side, and pulling a pin he stuck it into the palm of her hand, so that a drop of blood gushed out. This he sucked, as he had been told to do by the old woman, and immediately the princess came to herself, and flung her arms round his neck. Then she told him all her story, and what had happened since the ship had sailed away without him.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1229'>"Show me the battle-field," said he. And she took him to a wild heath, where the dead were lying as they fell, waiting for burial.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1234'>Once upon a time a little boy was born to a king who ruled over a great country through which ran a wide river. The king was nearly beside himself with joy, for he had always longed for a son to inherit his crown, and he sent messages to beg all the most powerful fairies to come and see this wonderful baby. In an hour or two, so many were gathered round the cradle, that the child seemed in danger of being smothered; but the king, who was watching the fairies eagerly, was disturbed to see them looking grave. "Is there anything the matter?" he asked anxiously.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1235'>The fairies looked at him, and all shook their heads at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1236'>"He is a beautiful boy, and it is a great pity; but what IS to happen WILL happen," said they.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1238'>For a time the king stood where he was, horror-stricken at what he had heard; but, being of a hopeful nature, he began at once to invent plans to save the prince from the dreadful doom that awaited him. He instantly sent for his master builder, and bade him construct a strong castle on the top of a mountain, which should be fitted with the most precious things from the king"s own palace, and every kind of toy a child could wish to play with. And, besides, he gave the strictest orders that a guard should walk round <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='guard;order;round' adjectives='strictest' verbs='walk;give' valence='6.28444444444' arousal='3.77888888889' dominance='5.45666666667'>the castle</entity> night and day.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1240'>One day, when the prince was old enough to run quite fast by himself, he looked from the terrace across the moat, and saw a little soft fluffy ball of a dog jumping and playing on the other side. Now, of course, all dogs had been kept from him for fear that the fairies" prophecy should come true, and he had never even beheld one before. So he turned to the page who was walking behind him, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1241'>"What is that funny little thing which is running so fast over there?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1242'>"That is a dog, prince," answered the page.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1243'>"Well, bring me one like it, and we will see which can run the faster." And he watched the dog till it had disappeared round the corner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1244'>The page was much puzzled to know what to do. He had strict orders to refuse the prince nothing; yet he remembered the prophecy, and felt that this was a serious matter.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1245'>"Oh, get him a dog if he wants one," said the king, "he will only cry his heart out if he does not have it." So a puppy was found, exactly like the other; they might have been twins, and perhaps they were.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1246'>Years went by, and the boy and the dog played together till the boy grew tall and strong. The time came at last when he sent a message to his father, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1247'>"Why do you keep me shut up here, doing nothing? I know all about the prophecy that was made at my birth, but I would far rather be killed at once than live an idle, useless life here.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1248'>And again the king listened to his wishes, and he and his dog were carried in a ship to the other side of the river, which was so broad here it might almost have been the sea. A black horse was waiting for him, tied to a tree, and he mounted and rode away wherever his fancy took him, the dog always at his heels. Never was any prince so happy as he, and he rode and rode till at length he came to a king"s palace.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1249'>The king who lived in it did not care about looking after his country, and seeing that his people lived cheerful and contented lives. He spent his whole time in making riddles, and inventing plans which he had much better have let alone.

It had seventy windows, each seventy feet from the ground, and he had sent the royal herald round the borders of the neighbouring kingdoms to proclaim that whoever could climb up the walls to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='kingdom;wife;wall;window;foot;border;round;ground' adjectives='neighbouring;royal' verbs='win;send;proclaim;herald;have;climb' valence='5.736' arousal='3.755' dominance='5.6545'>the window</entity> of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;wife;wall;window;foot;border;round;ground' adjectives='neighbouring;royal' verbs='win;send;proclaim;herald;have;climb' valence='5.736' arousal='3.755' dominance='5.6545'>the princess</entity> should win her for his wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1250'>The fame of the princess"s beauty had spread far and wide, and there was no lack of princes who wished to try their fortune.

But though some managed to get further than others, nobody was anywhere near the top.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1251'>They had already been spending several days in this manner when the young prince arrived, and as he was pleasant to look upon, and civil to talk to, they welcomed him to the house, which had been given to them, and saw that his bath was properly perfumed after his long journey. "Where do you come from?" they said at last. "And whose son are you?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1274'>When the prince and princess had been married a few months, the prince heard that his stepmother was dead, and his father was old and ill, and longing to have his eldest son by his side again. The young man could not remain deaf to such a message, and he took a tender farewell of his wife, and set out on his journey home. It was a long way, and he was forced to rest often on the road, and so it happened that, one night, when he was sleeping in a city on the banks of the great river, a huge crocodile came silently up and made its way along a passage to the prince"s room. Fortunately one of his guards woke up as it was trying to steal past them, and shut the crocodile up in a large hall, where a giant watched over it, never leaving the spot except during the night, when the crocodile slept. And this went on for more than a month.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1275'>Now, when the prince found that he was not likely to leave his father"s kingdom again, he sent for his wife, and bade the messenger tell her that he would await her coming in the town on the banks of the great river. This was the reason why he delayed his journey so long, and narrowly escaped being eaten by the crocodile. During the weeks that followed the prince amused himself as best he could, though he counted the minutes to the arrival of the princess, and when she did come, he at once prepared to start for the court. That very night, however, while he was asleep, the princess noticed something strange in one of the corners of the room. It was a dark patch, and seemed, as she looked, to grow longer and longer, and to be moving slowly towards the cushions on which the prince was lying. She shrank in terror, but, slight as was the noise, the thing heard it, and raised its head to listen. Then she saw it was the long flat head of a serpent, and the recollection of the prophecy rushed into her mind. Without waking her husband, she glided out of bed, and taking up a heavy bowl of milk which stood on a table, laid it on the floor in the path of the serpent--for she knew that no serpent in the world can resist milk. She held her breath as the snake drew near, and watched it throw up its head again as if it was smelling something nice, while its forky tongue darted out greedily. At length its eyes fell upon the milk, and in an instant it was lapping it so fast that it was a wonder the creature did not choke, for it never took its head from the bowl as long as a drop was left in it. After that it dropped on the ground and slept heavily. This was what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;s;sword;husband;snake' adjectives='' verbs='be;head;have;catch;sever;wait' valence='5.57785714286' arousal='4.675' dominance='5.30785714286'>the princess</entity> had been waiting for, and catching up her husband"s sword, she severed the snake"s head from its body.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1276'>The morning after this adventure the prince and princess set out for the king"s palace, but found when they reached it, that he was already dead. They gave him a magnificent burial, and then the prince had to examine the new laws which had been made in his absence, and do a great deal of business besides, till he grew quite ill from fatigue, and was obliged to go away to one of his palaces on the banks of the river, in order to rest. Here he soon got better, and began to hunt, and to shoot wild duck with his bow; and wherever he went, his dog, now grown very old, went with him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1277'>One morning the prince and his dog were out as usual, and in chasing their game they drew near the bank of the river. The prince was running at full speed after his dog when he almost fell over something that looked like a log of wood, which was lying in his path. To his surprise a voice spoke to him, and he saw that the thing which he had taken for a branch was really a crocodile.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1278'>"You cannot escape from me," it was saying, when he had gathered his senses again. "I am your fate, and wherever you go, and whatever you do, you will always find me before you. There is only one means of shaking off my power.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1279'>The young man walked sadly away, and when he reached the palace he shut himself into his room, and for the rest of the day refused to see anyone, not even his wife. At sunset, however, as no sound could be heard through the door, the princess grew quite frightened, and made such a noise that the prince was forced to draw back the bolt and let her come in. "How pale you look," she cried, "has anything hurt you? Tell me, I pray you, what is the matter, for perhaps I can help!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1280'>So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='crocodile;story;task' adjectives='impossible;whole' verbs='tell;give' valence='5.53375' arousal='4.42625' dominance='4.97125'>the prince</entity> told her the whole story, and of the impossible task given him by the crocodile.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1281'>"How can a sand hole remain full of water?" asked he. "Of course, it will all run through. The crocodile called it a "chance"; but he might as well have dragged me into the river at once. He said truly that I cannot escape him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1282'>"Oh, if that is all," cried the princess, "I can set you free myself, for my fairy godmother taught me to know the use of plants and in the desert not far from here there grows a little four-leaved herb which will keep the water in the pit for a whole year.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1283'>To comfort her husband, the princess had spoken lightly and gaily; but she knew very well she had no light task before her. Still, she was full of courage and energy, and determined that, one way or another, her husband should be saved.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1284'>It was still starlight when she left the palace on a snow-white donkey, and rode away from the river straight to the west. For some time she could see nothing before her but a flat waste of sand, which became hotter and hotter as the sun rose higher and higher. Then a dreadful thirst seized her and the donkey, but there was no stream to quench it, and if there had been she would hardly have had time to stop, for she still had far to go, and must be back before evening, or else the crocodile might declare that the prince had not fulfilled his conditions. So she spoke cheering words to her donkey, who brayed in reply, and the two pushed steadily on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1285'>Oh! how glad they both were when they caught sight of a tall rock in the distance. They forgot that they were thirsty, and that the sun was hot; and the ground seemed to fly under their feet, till the donkey stopped of its own accord in the cool shadow. But though the donkey might rest the princess could not, for the plant, as she knew, grew on the very top of the rock, and a wide chasm ran round the foot of it. Luckily she had brought a rope with her, and making a noose at one end, she flung it across with all her might. The first time it slid back slowly into the ditch, and she had to draw it up, and throw it again, but at length the noose caught on something, the princess could not see what, and had to trust her whole weight to this little bridge, which might snap and let her fall deep down among the rocks. And in that case her death was as certain as that of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='case;death' adjectives='certain' verbs='be' valence='4.96' arousal='4.25' dominance='5.24'>the prince</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1286'>But nothing so dreadful happened. The princess got safely to the other side, and then became the worst part of her task. As fast as she put her foot on a ledge of the rock the stone broke away from under her, and left her in the same place as before. Meanwhile the hours were passing, and it was nearly noon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1287'>The heart of the poor princess was filled with despair, but she would not give up the struggle. She looked round till she saw a small stone above her which seemed rather stronger than the rest, and by only poising her foot lightly on those that lay between, she managed by a great effort to reach it. In this way, with torn and bleeding hands, she gained the top; but here such a violent wind was blowing that she was almost blinded with dust, and was obliged to throw herself on the ground, and feel about after the precious herb.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1288'>For a few terrible moments she thought that the rock was bare, and that her journey had been to no purpose. Feel where she would, there was nothing but grit and stones, when, suddenly, her fingers touched something soft in a crevice. It was a plant, that was clear; but was it the right one? See she could not, for the wind was blowing more fiercely than ever, so she lay where she was and counted the leaves. One, two, three--yes! yes! there were four! And plucking a leaf she held it safe in her hand while she turned, almost stunned by the wind, to go down the rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1289'>When once she was safely over the side all became still in a moment, and she slid down the rock so fast that it was only a wonder that she did not land in the chasm. However, by good luck, she stopped quite close to her rope bridge and was soon across it.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1291'>At a signal from the princess the prince poured the water in the hole, and the moment it reached the brim the princess flung in the four-leaved plant.

The prince staggered, lost his balance and fell backwards into the river, where the mud and the rushes caught him and held him fast. He shrieked for help to his wife, who came running; and luckily brought her rope with her. The poor old dog was drowned, but the prince was pulled to shore. "My wife," he said, "has been stronger than my fate."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1298'>Once upon a time a fox lay peeping out of his hole, watching the road that ran by at a little distance, and hoping to see something that might amuse him, for he was feeling very dull and rather cross. For a long while he watched in vain; everything seemed asleep, and not even a bird stirred overhead. The fox grew crosser than ever, and he was just turning away in disgust from his place when he heard the sound of feet coming over the snow. He crouched eagerly down at the edge of the road and said to himself: "I wonder what would happen if I were to pretend to be dead! This is a man driving a reindeer sledge, I know the tinkling of the harness. And at any rate I shall have an adventure, and that is always something!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1299'>So he stretched himself out by the side of the road, carefully choosing a spot where the driver could not help seeing him, yet where the reindeer would not tread on him; and all fell out just as he had expected. The sledge-driver pulled up sharply, as his eyes lighted on the beautiful animal lying stiffly beside him, and jumping out he threw the fox into the bottom of the sledge, where the goods he was carrying were bound tightly together by ropes. The fox did not move a muscle though his bones were sore from the fall, and the driver got back to his seat again and drove on merrily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1300'>But before they had gone very far, the fox, who was near the edge, contrived to slip over, and when the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='town;sledge;fox;snow;reindeer;edge' adjectives='nearest;contrived;other;much;market-day' verbs='sell;be;have;pull;stretch;put;see;slip;go;fasten' valence='5.54956521739' arousal='3.95869565217' dominance='5.51260869565'>Laplander</entity> saw him stretched out on the snow he pulled up his reindeer and put the fox into one of the other sledges that was fastened behind, for it was market-day at the nearest town, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='town;sledge;fox;snow;reindeer;edge' adjectives='nearest;contrived;other;much;market-day' verbs='sell;be;have;pull;stretch;put;see;slip;go;fasten' valence='5.54956521739' arousal='3.95869565217' dominance='5.51260869565'>the man</entity> had much to sell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1301'>They drove on a little further, when some noise in the forest made the man turn his head, just in time to see the fox fall with a heavy thump on to the frozen snow. "That beast is bewitched!" he said to himself, and then he threw the fox into the last sledge of all, which had a cargo of fishes. This was exactly what the cunning creature wanted, and he wriggled gently to the front and bit the cord which tied the sledge to the one before it so that it remained standing in the middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cord;standing;sledge;middle;front;bit;creature' adjectives='cunning' verbs='wriggle;be;remain;want;tie' valence='5.50846153846' arousal='3.77538461538' dominance='5.51230769231'>the road</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1302'>Now there were so many sledges that the Lapp did not notice for a long while that one was missing; indeed, he would have entered the town without knowing if snow had not suddenly begun to fall. Then he got down to secure more firmly the cloths that kept his goods dry, and going to the end of the long row, discovered that the sledge containing the fish and the fox was missing. He quickly unharnessed one of his reindeer and rode back along <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='standing;cord;means;sledge;fox;middle;reindeer;noose;close' adjectives='safe' verbs='be;unharness;ride;move;find;have;come;bite' valence='5.4865' arousal='3.7275' dominance='5.569'>the way</entity> he had come, to find the sledge standing safe in the middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='standing;cord;means;sledge;fox;middle;reindeer;noose;close' adjectives='safe' verbs='be;unharness;ride;move;find;have;come;bite' valence='5.4865' arousal='3.7275' dominance='5.569'>the road</entity>; but as the fox had bitten off the cord close to the noose there was no means of moving it away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1303'>The fox meanwhile was enjoying himself mightily. As soon as he had loosened the sledge, he had taken his favourite fish from among the piles neatly arranged for sale, and had trotted off to the forest with it in his mouth. By-and-by he met a bear, who stopped and said: "Where did you find that fish, Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fish;mr.;bear' adjectives='by-and-by' verbs='meet;say;stop;find;do' valence='5.65111111111' arousal='4.07333333333' dominance='5.62111111111'>Fox</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1304'>"Oh, not far off," answered he; "I just stuck my tail in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='elf;tail;place;fish' adjectives='' verbs='answer;dwell;hang;stick' valence='5.45727272727' arousal='3.94454545455' dominance='5.55181818182'>the stream</entity> close by the place where the elves dwell, and the fish hung on to it of itself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1305'>"Dear me," snarled the bear, who was hungry and not in a good temper, "if the fish hung on to your tail, I suppose he will hang on to mine."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1306'>"Yes, certainly, grandfather," replied the fox, "if you have patience to suffer what I suffered."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1307'>"Of course I can," replied the bear, "what nonsense you talk! Show me <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='show' adjectives='' verbs='' valence='5.60666666667' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.22'>the way</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1308'>So the fox led him to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stream;sunshine;fox;moment;place;glittering' adjectives='warm' verbs='be;have;lead;freeze' valence='6.12125' arousal='4.155625' dominance='5.62'>the bank</entity> of a stream, which, being in a warm place, had only lightly frozen in places, and was at this moment glittering in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stream;sunshine;fox;moment;place;glittering' adjectives='warm' verbs='be;have;lead;freeze' valence='6.12125' arousal='4.155625' dominance='5.62'>the spring</entity> sunshine.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1309'>"The elves bathe here," he said, "and if you put in your tail the fish will catch hold of it. But it is no use being in a hurry, or you will spoil everything."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1310'>Then he trotted off, but only went out of sight of the bear, who stood still on the bank with his tail deep in the water. Soon the sun set and it grew very cold and the ice formed rapidly, and the bear"s tail was fixed as tight as if a vice had held it; and when the fox saw that everything had happened just as he had planned it, he called out loudly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1311'>"Be quick, good people, and come with your bows and spears. A bear has been fishing in your brook!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1312'>And in a moment the whole place was full of little creatures each one with a tiny bow and a spear hardly big enough for a baby; but both arrows and spears could sting, as the bear knew very well, and in his fright he gave such a tug to his tail that it broke short off, and he rolled away into the forest as fast as his legs could carry him. At this sight the fox held his sides for laughing, and then scampered away in another direction. By-and-by he came to a fir tree, and crept into a hole under the root. After that he did something very strange.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1313'>Taking one of his hind feet between his two front paws, he said softly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1314'>"What would you do, my foot, if someone was to betray me?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1322'>But the fox was comfortable where he was, and did not hurry himself to take his tail"s advice. And before very long he found he was too late, for the bear had come round by another path, and guessing where his enemy was began to scratch at the roots of the tree. The fox made himself as small as he could, but a scrap of his tail peeped out, and the bear seized it and held it tight. Then the fox dug his claws into the ground, but he was not strong enough to pull against the bear, and slowly he was dragged forth and his body flung over the bear"s neck. In this manner they set out down <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fox;tail;bear;s;mouth;manner' adjectives='' verbs='be;set' valence='5.46' arousal='4.013' dominance='5.317'>the road</entity>, the fox"s tail being always in the bear"s mouth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1323'>After they had gone some way, they passed a tree-stump, on which a bright coloured woodpecker was tapping.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1325'>"What are you saying, old fellow?" asked the bear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1326'>"I? Oh, I was saying nothing," answered the fox drearily. "Just carry me to your cave and eat me up as quick as you can."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1327'>The bear was silent, and thought of his supper; and the two continued their journey till they reached another tree with a woodpecker tapping on it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1328'>"Ah! those were better times when I used to paint all the birds such gay colours," said the fox again to himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1329'>"Couldn"t you paint me too?" asked the bear suddenly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1330'>But the fox shook his head; for he was always acting, even if no one was there to see him do it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1331'>"You bear pain so badly," he replied, in a thoughtful voice, "and you are impatient besides, and could never put up with all that is necessary. Why, you would first have to dig a pit, and then twist ropes of willow, and drive in posts and fill the hole with pitch, and, last of all, set it on fire. Oh, no; you would never be able to do all that."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1332'>"It does not matter a straw how hard the work is," answered the bear eagerly, "I will do it every bit." And as he spoke he began tearing up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pit' adjectives='ready;deep' verbs='tear;be;begin;hold;speak' valence='5.53818181818' arousal='4.12454545455' dominance='5.37545454545'>the earth</entity> so fast that soon a deep pit was ready, deep enough to hold him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1333'>"That is all right," said the fox at last, "I see I was mistaken in you. Now sit here, and I will bind you." So the bear sat down on the edge of the pit, and the fox sprang on his back, which he crossed with the willow ropes, and then set fire to the pitch. It burnt up in an instant, and caught the bands of willow and the bear"s rough hair; but he did not stir, for he thought that the fox was rubbing the bright colours into his skin, and that he would soon be as beautiful as a whole meadow of flowers. But when the fire grew hotter still he moved uneasily from one foot to the other, saying, imploringly: "It is getting rather warm, old man." But all the answer he got was: "I thought you would never be able to suffer pain like those little birds."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1334'>The bear did not like being told that he was not as brave as a bird, so he set his teeth and resolved to endure anything sooner than speak again; but by this time the last willow band had burned through, and with a push the fox sent his victim tumbling into the grass, and ran off to hide himself in the forest. After a while he stole cautiously and found, as he expected, nothing left but a few charred bones. These he picked up and put in a bag, which he slung over his back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1335'>By-and-by he met a <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='reindeer;fox;bone;team' adjectives='by-and-by' verbs='rattle;meet;draw;drive' valence='5.712' arousal='4.087' dominance='5.727'>Lapp</entity> driving his team of reindeer along <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='reindeer;fox;bone;team' adjectives='by-and-by' verbs='rattle;meet;draw;drive' valence='5.712' arousal='4.087' dominance='5.727'>the road</entity>, and as he drew near, the fox rattled the bones gaily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1336'>"That sounds like silver or gold," thought the man to himself. And he said politely to the fox:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1337'>"Good-day, friend! What have you got in your bag that makes such a strange sound?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1338'>"All the wealth my father left me," answered the fox. "Do you feel inclined to bargain?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1339'>"Well, I don"t mind," replied the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='money;fox;mind;t;man' adjectives='eager;prudent' verbs='do;don;be;wish;show;have;reply;get;think' valence='5.95526315789' arousal='4.40578947368' dominance='5.84105263158'>Lapp</entity>, who was a prudent man, and did not wish the fox to think him too eager; "but show me first what money you have got."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1340'>"Ah, but I can"t do that," answered the fox, "my bag is sealed up. But if you will give me those three reindeer, you shall take it as it is, with all its contents."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1341'>The Lapp did not quite like it, but the fox spoke with such an air that his doubts melted away. He nodded, and stretched out his hand; the fox put the bag into it, and unharnassed the reindeer he had chosen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1342'>"Oh, I forgot!" he exclaimed, turning round, as he was about to drive them in the opposite direction, "you must be sure not to open the bag until you have gone at least five miles, right on the other side of those hills out there. If you do, you will find that all the gold and silver has changed into a parcel of charred bones." Then he whipped up his reindeer, and was soon out of sight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1343'>For some time the Lapp was satisfied with hearing the bones rattle, and thinking to himself what a good bargain he had made, and of all the things he would buy with the money. But, after a bit, this amusement ceased to content him, and besides, what was the use of planning when you did not know for certain how rich you were? Perhaps there might be a great deal of silver and only a little gold in the bag; or a great deal of gold, and only a little silver. Who could tell? He would not, of course, take the money out to count it, for that might bring him bad luck. But there could be no harm in just one peep! So he slowly broke the seal, and untied the strings, and, behold, a heap of burnt bones lay before him! In a minute he knew he had been tricked, and flinging the bag to the ground in a rage, he ran after the fox as fast as his snow-shoes would carry him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1344'>Now the fox had guessed exactly what would happen, and was on the look out. Directly he saw the little speck coming towards him, he wished that the man"s snow-shoes might break, and that very instant the Lapp"s shoes snapped in two. The Lapp did now know that this was the fox"s work, but he had to stop and fetch one of his other reindeer, which he mounted, and set off again in pursuit of his enemy. The fox soon heard him coming, and this time he wished that the reindeer might fall and break its leg. And so it did; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fox;match;chase' adjectives='hopeless' verbs='feel;do;be' valence='5.156' arousal='4.247' dominance='5.237'>the man</entity> felt it was a hopeless chase, and that he was no match for the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1345'>So the fox drove on in peace till he reached the cave where all his stores were kept, and then he began to wonder whom he could get to help him kill his reindeer, for though he could steal reindeer he was too small to kill them. "After all, it will be quite easy," thought he, and he bade a squirrel, who was watching him on a tree close by, take a message to all the robber beasts of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='squirrel;tree;frog;beast;wolf;snake;branch;message;mouse;robber;creature' adjectives='great;other;easy;less' verbs='be;crash;bid;watch;bear;hear;take;press;come;think' valence='5.51166666667' arousal='4.1975' dominance='5.31111111111'>the forest</entity>, and in less than half an hour a great crashing of branches was heard, and bears, wolves, snakes, mice, frogs, and other creatures came pressing up to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='squirrel;tree;frog;beast;wolf;snake;branch;message;mouse;robber;creature' adjectives='great;other;easy;less' verbs='be;crash;bid;watch;bear;hear;take;press;come;think' valence='5.51166666667' arousal='4.1975' dominance='5.31111111111'>the cave</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1346'>When they heard why they had been summoned, they declared themselves ready each one to do his part. The bear took his crossbow from his neck and shot the reindeer in the chin; and, from that day to this, every reindeer has a mark in that same spot, which is always known as the bear"s arrow. The wolf shot him in the thigh, and the sign of his arrow still remains; and so with the mouse and the viper and all the rest, even the frog; and at the last the reindeer all died. And the fox did nothing, but looked on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1347'>"I really must go down to the brook and wash myself," said he (though he was perfectly clean), and he went under the bank and hid himself behind a stone. From there he set up the most frightful shrieks, so that the animals fled away in all directions. Only the mouse and the ermine remained where they were, for they thought that they were much too small to be noticed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1348'>The fox continued his shrieks till he felt sure that the animals must have got to a safe distance; then he crawled out of his hiding-place and went to the bodies of the reindeer, which he now had all to himself. He gathered a bundle of sticks for a fire, and was just preparing to cook a steak, when his enemy, the Lapp, came up, panting with haste and excitement.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1349'>"What are you doing there?" cried he; "why did you palm off those bones on me? And why, when you had got the reindeer, did you kill them?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1350'>"Dear brother," answered the fox with a sob, "do not blame me for this misfortune. It is my comrades who have slain them in spite of my prayers."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1351'>The man made no reply, for the white fur of the ermine, who was crouching with the mouse behind some stones, had just caught his eye. He hastily seized the iron hook which hung over the fire and flung it at the little creature; but the ermine was too quick for him, and the hook only touched the top of its tail, and that has remained black to this day. As for the mouse, the Lapp threw a half-burnt stick after him, and though it was not enough to hurt him, his beautiful white skin was smeared all over with it, and all the washing in the world would not make him clean again. And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ermine;mouse;round' adjectives='wiser' verbs='be;let;find;have;turn' valence='5.51153846154' arousal='3.51230769231' dominance='5.39'>the man</entity> would have been wiser if he had let the ermine and the mouse alone, for when he turned round again he found he was alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1352'>Directly the fox noticed that his enemy"s attention had wandered from himself he watched his chance, and stole softly away till he had reached a clump of thick bushes, when he ran as fast as he could, till he reached a river, where a man was mending his boat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1353'>"Oh, I wish, I wish, I had a boat to mend too!" he cried, sitting up on his hind-legs and looking into <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hind-leg;s' adjectives='' verbs='face;cry;look;sit' valence='5.295' arousal='4.39166666667' dominance='5.15'>the man</entity>"s face.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1354'>"Stop your silly chatter!" answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bath' adjectives='' verbs='answer;give' valence='6.03625' arousal='4.1625' dominance='5.65625'>the man</entity> crossly, "or I will give you a bath in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bath' adjectives='' verbs='answer;give' valence='6.03625' arousal='4.1625' dominance='5.65625'>the river</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1355'>"Oh, I wish, I do wish, I had a boat to mend," cried the fox again, as if he had not heard. And the man grew angry and seized him by the tail, and threw him far out in the stream close to the edge of an island; which was just what the fox wanted. He easily scrambled up, and sitting on the top, he called: "Hasten, hasten, O fishes, and carry me to the other side!" And the fishes left the stones where they had been sleeping, and the pools where they had been feeding, and hurried to see who could get to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fish;stone;pool' adjectives='' verbs='feed;be;get;leave;see;sleep;have;hurry' valence='6.142' arousal='3.94' dominance='5.86'>the island</entity> first.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1356'>"I have won," shouted the pike. "Jump on my back, dear fox, and you will find yourself in a trice on the opposite shore."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1357'>"No, thank you," answered the fox, "your back is much too weak for me. I should break it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1358'>"Try mine," said the eel, who had wriggled to the front.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1359'>"No, thank you," replied the fox again, "I should slip over your head and be drowned."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1360'>"You won"t slip on MY back," said the perch, coming forward.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1361'>"No; but you are really TOO rough," returned the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1362'>"Well, you can have no fault to find with ME," put in the trout.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1363'>"Good gracious! are YOU here?" exclaimed the fox. "But I"m afraid to trust myself to you either."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1364'>At this moment a fine salmon swam slowly up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1365'>"Ah, yes, you are the person I want," said the fox; "but come near, so that I may get on your back, without wetting my feet."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1366'>So the salmon swam close under the island, and when he was touching it the fox seized him in his claws and drew him out of the water, and put him on a spit, while he kindled a fire to cook him by. When everything was ready, and the water in the pot was getting hot, he popped him in, and waited till he thought the salmon was nearly boiled. But as he stooped down the water gave a sudden fizzle, and splashed into the fox"s eyes, blinding him. He started backwards with a cry of pain, and sat still for some minutes, rocking himself to and fro. When he was a little better he rose and walked down a road till he met a grouse, who stopped and asked what was the matter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1367'>"Have you a pair of eyes anywhere about you?" asked the fox politely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1368'>"No, I am afraid I haven"t," answered the grouse, and passed on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1369'>A little while after the fox heard the buzzing of an early bee, whom a gleam of sun had tempted out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1370'>"Do you happen to have an extra pair of eyes anywhere?" asked the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1371'>"I am sorry to say I have only those I am using," replied the bee. And the fox went on till he nearly fell over an asp who was gliding across <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='asp;fox' adjectives='' verbs='go;be;glide;fall' valence='5.51428571429' arousal='4.32571428571' dominance='5.34142857143'>the road</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1372'>"I should be SO glad if you would tell me where I could get a pair of eyes," said the fox. "I suppose you don"t happen to have any you could lend me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1373'>"Well, if you only want them for a short time, perhaps I could manage," answered the asp; "but I can"t do without them for long."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1374'>"Oh, it is only for a very short time that I need them," said the fox; "I have a pair of my own just behind that hill, and when I find them I will bring yours back to you. Perhaps you will keep these till them." So he took the eyes out of his own head and popped them into the head of the asp, and put the asp"s eyes in their place. As he was running off he cried over his shoulder: "As long as the world lasts the asps" eyes will go down in the heads of foxes from generation to generation."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1375'>And so it has been; and if you look at the eyes of an asp you will see that they are all burnt; and though thousands and thousands of years have gone by since the fox was going about playing tricks upon everybody he met, the asp still bears the traces of the day when the sly creature cooked the salmon.</paragraph>

What a hunt there was for that kitten, to be sure! The servants, each anxious to find her, as the queen was certain to reward the lucky man, searched in the most impossible places. Boxes were opened that would hardly have held the kitten"s paw; books were taken from bookshelves, lest the kitten should have got behind them, drawers were pulled out, for perhaps the kitten might have got shut in.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1423'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1424'>Far away on the other side of the world there lived, long ago, a lion and his younger brother, the wild cat, who were so fond of each other that they shared the same hut. The lion was much the bigger and stronger of the two--indeed, he was much bigger and stronger than any of the beasts that dwelt in the forest; and, besides, he could jump father and run faster than all the rest. If strength and swiftness could gain him a dinner he was sure never to be without one, but when it came to cunning, both the grizzly bear and the serpent could get the better of him, and he was forced to call in the help of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='strength;help;serpent;bear;cat;dinner;swiftness' adjectives='better;grizzly;sure;cunning' verbs='be;force;get;call;gain;come' valence='5.775' arousal='4.236' dominance='5.622'>the wild</entity> cat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1425'>Now the young wild cat had a lovely golden ball, so beautiful that you could hardly look at it except through a piece of smoked glass, and he kept it hidden in the thick fur muff that went round his neck. A very large old animal, since dead, had given it to him when he was hardly more than a baby, and had told him never to part with it, for as long as he kept it no harm could ever come near him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1427'>One day the two brothers started to hunt at daybreak, but as the cat could not run nearly as fast as the lion, he had quite a long start. At least he THOUGHT it was a long one, but in a very few bounds and springs the lion reached his side.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1428'>"There is a bear sitting on that tree," he whispered softly. "He is only waiting for us to pass, to drop down on my back."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1429'>"Ah, you are so big that he does not see I am behind you," answered the wild cat. And, touching the ball, he just said: "Bear, die!" And the bear tumbled dead out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='front;bear' adjectives='dead' verbs='roll;tumble' valence='5.262' arousal='3.976' dominance='4.3'>the tree</entity>, and rolled over just in front of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1430'>For some time they trotted on without any adventures, till just as they were about to cross a strip of long grass on the edge of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ear;rustling;time;s;lion;edge;adventure;noise;strip;grass' adjectives='quick;faint;long' verbs='be;detect;cross;trot' valence='5.44277777778' arousal='4.56166666667' dominance='5.30222222222'>the forest</entity>, the lion"s quick ears detected a faint rustling noise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1431'>"That is a snake," he cried, stopping short, for he was much more afraid of snakes than of bears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1432'>"Oh, it is all right," answered the cat. "Snake, die!" And the snake died, and the two brothers skinned it. They then folded the skin up into a very small parcel, and the cat tucked it into his mane, for snakes" skins can do all sorts of wonderful things, if you are lucky enough to have one of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1433'>All this time they had had no dinner, for the snake"s flesh was not nice, and the lion did not like eating bear--perhaps because he never felt sure that the bear was REALLY dead, and would not jump up alive when his enemy went near him. Most people are afraid of SOME thing, and bears and serpents were the only creatures that caused the lion"s heart to tremble. So the two brothers set off again and soon reached the side of a hill where some fine deer were grazing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1434'>"Kill one of those deer for your own dinner," said the boy-brother, "but catch me another alive. I want him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1435'>The lion at once sprang towards them with a loud roar, but the deer bounded away, and they were all three soon lost to sight. The cat waited for a long while, but finding that the lion did not return, went back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='while;lion;cat' adjectives='long' verbs='do;return;live;go;find;wait' valence='6.03363636364' arousal='4.09090909091' dominance='5.67363636364'>the house</entity> where they lived.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1436'>It was quite dark when the lion came home, where his brother was sitting curled up in one corner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1437'>"Did you catch the deer for me?" asked the boy-brother, springing up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1438'>"Well, no," replied the man-brother. "The fact is, that I did not get up to them till we had run half way across the world and left the wind far behind us. Think what a trouble it would have been to drag it here! So--I just ate them both."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1439'>The cat said nothing, but he did not feel that he loved his big brother. He had thought a great deal about that deer, and had meant to get on his back to ride him as a horse, and go to see all the wonderful places the lion talked to him about when he was in a good temper. The more he thought of it the more sulky he grew, and in the morning, when the lion said that it was time for them to start to hunt, the cat told him that he might kill the bear and snake by himself, as HE had a headache, and would rather stay at home. The little fellow knew quite well that the lion would not dare to go out without him and his ball for fear of meeting a bear or a snake.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1440'>The quarrel went on, and for many days neither of the brothers spoke to each other, and what made them still more cross was, that they could get very little to eat, and we know that people are often cross when they are hungry. At last it occurred to the lion that if he could only steal the magic ball he could kill bears and snakes for himself, and then the cat might be as sulky as he liked for anything that it would matter. But how was the stealing to be done? The cat had the ball hung round his neck day and night, and he was such a light sleeper that it was useless to think of taking it while he slept. No! the only thing was to get him to lend it of his own accord, and after some days the lion (who was not at all clever) hit upon a plan that he thought would do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1441'>"Dear me, how dull it is here!" said the lion one afternoon, when the rain was pouring down in such torrents that, however sharp your eyes or your nose might be, you could not spy a single bird or beast among the bushes. "Dear me, how dull, how dreadfully dull I am. Couldn"t we have a game of catch with that golden ball of yours?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1442'>"I don"t care about playing catch, it does not amuse me," answered the cat, who was as cross as ever; for no cat, even to this day, ever forgets an injury done to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1443'>"Well, then, lend me the ball for a little, and I will play by myself," replied the lion, stretching out a paw as he spoke.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1444'>"You can"t play in the rain, and if you did, you would only lose it in the bushes," said the cat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1445'>"Oh, no, I won"t; I will play in here. Don"t be so ill-natured." And with a very bad grace the cat untied the string and threw the golden ball into the lion"s lap, and composed himself to sleep again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1446'>For a long while the lion tossed it up and down gaily, feeling that, however sound asleep the boy-brother might LOOK, he was sure to have one eye open; but gradually he began to edge closer to the opening, and at last gave such a toss that the ball went up high into the air, and he could not see what became of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1447'>"Oh, how stupid of me!" he cried, as the cat sprang up angrily, "let us go at once and search for it. It can"t really have fallen very far." But though they searched that day and the next, and the next after that, they never found it, because it never came down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1448'>After the loss of his ball the cat refused to live with the lion any longer, but wandered away to the north, always hoping he might meet with his ball again. But months passed, and years passed, and though he travelled over hundreds of miles, he never saw any traces of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1449'>At length, when he was getting quite old, he came to a place unlike any that he had ever seen before, where a big river rolled right to the foot of some high mountains. The ground all about the river bank was damp and marshy, and as no cat likes to wet its feet, this one climbed a tree that rose high above the water, and thought sadly of his lost ball, which would have helped him out of this horrible place. Suddenly he saw a beautiful ball, for all the world like his own, dangling from a branch of the tree he was on. He longed to get at it; but was the branch strong enough to bear his weight? It was no use, after all he had done, getting drowned in the water. However, it could do no harm, if he was to go a little way; he could always manage to get back somehow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1450'>So he stretched himself at full length upon the branch, and wriggled his body cautiously along. To his delight it seemed thick and stout. Another movement, and, by stretching out his paw, he would be able to draw the string towards him, when the branch gave a loud crack, and the cat made haste to wriggle himself back <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='string;paw;cat;haste;branch;crack;movement' adjectives='loud;able' verbs='be;draw;give;stretch;make;wriggle;have;come' valence='5.6245' arousal='3.8705' dominance='5.5975'>the way</entity> he had come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1451'>But when cats make up their minds to do anything they generally DO it; and this cat began to look about to see if there was really no way of getting at his ball. Yes! there was, and it was much surer than the other, though rather more difficult. Above the bough where the ball was hung was another bough much thicker, which he knew could not break with his weight; and by holding on tight to this with all his four paws, he could just manage to touch the ball with his tail. He would thus be able to whisk the ball to and fro till, by-and-by, the string would become quite loose, and it would fall to the ground. It might take some time, but the lion"s little brother was patient, like most cats.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1452'>Well, it all happened just as the cat intended it should, and when the ball dropped on the ground the cat ran down the tree like lightning, and, picking it up, tucked it away in the snake"s skin round his neck. Then he began jumping along the shore of the Big Water from one place to another, trying to find a boat, or even a log of wood, that would take him across. But there was nothing; only, on the other side, he saw two girls cooking, and though he shouted to them at the top of his voice, they were too far off to hear what he said. And, what was worse, the ball suddenly fell out of its snake"s skin bag right into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ball;bag;s;right;snake;skin' adjectives='worse' verbs='be;fall' valence='5.56777777778' arousal='4.36555555556' dominance='5.12444444444'>the river</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1453'>Now, it is not at all an uncommon thing for balls to tumble into rivers, but in that case they generally either fall to the bottom and stay there, or else bob about on the top of the water close to where they first touched it. But this ball, instead of doing either of these things, went straight across to the other side, and there one of the girls saw it when she stooped to dip some water into her pail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1454'>"Oh! what a lovely ball!" cried she, and tried to catch it in her pail; but the ball always kept bobbing just out of her reach.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1455'>"Come and help me!" she called to her sister, and after a long while they had the ball safe inside the pail. They were delighted with their new toy, and one or the other held it in her hand till bedtime came, and then it was a long time before they could make up their minds where it would be safest for the night. At last they locked it in a cupboard in one corner of their room, and as there was no hole anywhere the ball could not possibly get out. After that they went to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1456'>In the morning the first thing they both did was to run to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thing;unlock;ball;man' adjectives='young;handsome' verbs='do;run;be;start;stand;open' valence='5.87111111111' arousal='3.93333333333' dominance='5.80111111111'>the cupboard</entity> and unlock it, but when <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thing;unlock;ball;man' adjectives='young;handsome' verbs='do;run;be;start;stand;open' valence='5.87111111111' arousal='3.93333333333' dominance='5.80111111111'>the door</entity> opened they started back, for, instead of the ball, there stood a handsome young man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1457'>"Ladies," he said, "how can I thank you for what you have done for me? Long, long ago, I was enchanted by a wicked fairy, and condemned to keep the shape of a ball till I should meet with two maidens, who would take me to their own home. But where was I to meet them? For hundreds of years I have lived in the depths of the forest, where nothing but wild beasts ever came, and it was only when the lion threw me into the sky that I was able to fall to earth near this river. Where there is a river, sooner or later people will come; so, hanging myself on a tree, I watched and waited. For a moment I lost heart when I fell once more into the hands of my old master the wild cat, but my hopes rose again as I saw he was making for the river bank opposite where you were standing.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1543'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1544'>Over all the vast under-world the mountain Gnome Rubezahl was lord; and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him. There were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through, and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks. Some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal, or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies; for Rubezahl loved all pretty things. Sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions, and come out upon the green earth for a while, and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing. And as gnomes live many hundreds of years he saw strange things. For, the first time he came up, the great hills were covered with thick forests, in which wild animals roamed, and Rubezahl watched the fierce fights between bear and bison, or chased the grey wolves, or amused himself by rolling great rocks down into the desolate valleys, to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills. But the next time he ventured above ground, what was his surprise to find everything changed! The dark woods were hewn down, and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounding cosy-looking thatched cottages; for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air, sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows, while from the shade of the hedges came the music of the shepherd"s pipe. The strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests, who, without saying "by your leave" or "with your leave," had made themselves so very much at home upon is hills; nor did he wish to interfere with their doings, but left them in quiet possession of their homes, as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves. He was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called "man," so, taking the form of an old field labourer, he entered the service of a farmer. Under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly, but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful, and Rubezahl soon left him, and went to be shepherd to his next neighbour. He tended the flock so diligently, and knew so well where to lead the sheep to the sweetest pastures, and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away, that they too prospered under his care, and not one was lost or torn by wolves; but this new master was a hard man, and begrudged him his well-earned wages. So he ran away and went to serve the judge. Here he upheld the law with might and main, and was a terror to thieves and evildoers; but the judge was a bad man, who took bribes, and despised the law. Rubezahl would not be the tool of an unjust man, and so he told his master, who thereupon ordered him to be thrown in prison. Of course that did not trouble the gnome at all, he simply got out through the keyhole, and went away down to his underground palace, very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind. But, as time went on, he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him, and thought he would take another look at the upper world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1545'>So he stole into the valley, keeping himself carefully hidden in copse or hedgerow, and very soon met with an adventure; for, peeping through a screen of leaves, he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden, fresh as the spring, and beautiful to look upon. Around her upon the grass lay her young companions, as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game. Beyond them flowed a little brook, into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock, filling the air with its pleasant sound, and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide. The sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that, for the first time, he wished himself a mortal; and, longing for a better view of the gay company, he changed himself into a raven and perched upon an oaktree which overhung the brook. But he soon found that this was not at all a good plan. He could only see with a raven"s eyes, and feel as a raven feels; and a nest of field-mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens. When he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket, and took the form of a handsome young man--that was the best way--and he fell in love with the girl then and there. The fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country, and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits, till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn by the brook to rest, or to bathe in the cool waters. On this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood. This was Master Rubezahl"s opportunity. Stepping out of his hiding-place he stood in the midst of the little lawn, weaving his magic spells, till slowly all about him changed, and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting-place they stood lost in amazement, and almost fancied that they must be dreaming. The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster; <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='diamond;alabaster;drop;bed;side;shower;breeze;fountain;silence;rock;marble;channel' adjectives='clear;white;smooth;rocky;red' verbs='have;flow;scatter;leap;struggle;murmur;fall;become;wander' valence='5.66' arousal='3.84814814815' dominance='5.40296296296'>the stream</entity> that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed, flowed in silence now in its smooth channel, from which a clear fountain leapt, to fall again in showers of diamond drops, now on this side now on that, as the wandering breeze scattered it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1546'>Daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink, while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round, making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable. To the right and left of the waterfall opened out a wonderful grotto, its walls and arches glittering with many-coloured rock-crystals, while in every niche were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats, the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them. She hesitated a while, however, scarcely able to believe her eyes, and not knowing if she should enter the enchanted spot or fly from it. But at length curiosity prevailed, and she and her companions explored to their heart"s content, and tasted and examined everything, running hither and thither in high glee, and calling merrily to each other.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1547'>At last, when they were quite weary, the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool, which certainly did look very inviting; and they all went gaily to this new amusement. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='depths;lock;hair;rim;playmate' adjectives='ready;golden;floating;much;frightened' verbs='be;have;seize;sink;slip;vanish' valence='5.58294117647' arousal='4.23529411765' dominance='5.19705882353'>The princess</entity> was ready first, but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='depths;lock;hair;rim;playmate' adjectives='ready;golden;floating;much;frightened' verbs='be;have;seize;sink;slip;vanish' valence='5.58294117647' arousal='4.23529411765' dominance='5.19705882353'>the pool</entity> when down--down--down she sank, and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1548'>Loudly did they weep and wail, running about the brink of the pool, which looked so shallow and so clear, but which had swallowed up their princess before their eyes. They even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her, but in vain; they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool, and could not keep under water for a second.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1549'>They saw at last that there was nothing for it but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughter"s disappearance. And what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told! The king tore his robes, dashed his golden crown from his head, and hid his face in his purple mantle for grief and anguish at the loss of the princess. After the first outburst of wailing, however, he took heart and hurried off to see for himself the scene of this strange adventure, thinking, as people will in sorrow, that there might be some mistake after all. But when he reached the spot, behold, all was changed again! The glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished, and so had the marble bath, the bower of jasmine; instead, all was a tangle of flowers, as it had been of old. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sort;affair;story;hunt;sprite;anything;disappearance;work;playfellow;s;something;loss;goblin;punishment;king' adjectives='whole;much;perplexed;same;grand' verbs='be;repeat;console;confess;bear;try;put;threaten;trouble;order' valence='5.11206896552' arousal='4.36068965517' dominance='5.29620689655'>The king</entity> was so much perplexed that he threatened <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sort;affair;story;hunt;sprite;anything;disappearance;work;playfellow;s;something;loss;goblin;punishment;king' adjectives='whole;much;perplexed;same;grand' verbs='be;repeat;console;confess;bear;try;put;threaten;trouble;order' valence='5.11206896552' arousal='4.36068965517' dominance='5.29620689655'>the princess</entity>"s playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance; but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some sprite or goblin, and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt; for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1551'>When the water-nymphs, who were hiding in readiness, had caught her and dragged her out of the sight of her terrified maidens, she herself had not had time to be frightened. They swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her father"s seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it, and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch, wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle, while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear. The gnome, for he it was, told her all about himself and his great underground kingdom, and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace, and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendour. On three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay, sweet flowers, and velvet lawns all cool and shady, which pleased the eye of the princess. The fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples, and nightingales sang in every bush, as the gnome and the princess wandered in the leafy alleys, sometimes gazing at the moon, sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her adornment. And all the time he was thinking to himself that never, during the hundreds of years he had lived, had he seen so charming a maiden. But the princess felt no such happiness; in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad, though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome. However, he soon perceived her melancholy, and in a thousand ways strove to dispel the cloud, but in vain. At last he said to himself: "Men are sociable creatures, like bees or ants. Doubtless this lovely mortal is pining for company. Who is there I can find for her to talk to?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1552'>Thereupon he hastened into the nearest filed and dug up a dozen or so of different roots--carrots, turnips, and radishes--and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='radish;carrot;turnip;shade;basket;root;rose-bower' adjectives='nearest;different;pensive;elegant' verbs='sit;dig;bring;lay;file;hasten' valence='5.64722222222' arousal='3.82277777778' dominance='5.66055555556'>the princess</entity>, who sat pensive in the shade of the rose-bower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1553'>"Loveliest daughter of earth," said the gnome, "banish all sorrow; no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling. In this basket is all you need to make this spot delightful to you. Take this little many-coloured wand, and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1554'>With this he left her, and the princess, without an instant"s delay, opened the basket, and touching a turnip, cried eagerly: "Brunhilda, my dear Brunhilda! come to me quickly!" And sure enough there was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='princess' adjectives='sure;beloved' verbs='be;hug;chatter;kiss' valence='6.58888888889' arousal='4.52' dominance='5.99888888889'>Brunhilda</entity>, joyfully hugging and kissing her beloved princess, and chattering as gaily as in the old days.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1555'>This sudden appearance was so delightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes, and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more. Hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden, and gathered the golden apples from the trees, and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace, until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments the gnome had given to his hoped-for bride. There they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes. Veils, girdles, and necklaces were tried on and admired, the imitation Brunhilda knew so well how to behave herself, and showed so much taste that nobody would ever have suspected that she was nothing but a turnip after all. The gnome, who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them, was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman; and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before. She did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand, and soon had all her maidens about her, and even, as she had two tiny radishes to spare, her favourite cat, and her little dog whose name was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wand;maiden;radish;dog;rest;cat;root;name' adjectives='favourite;spare;little;magic;tiny' verbs='touch;do;forget;have;be' valence='5.90842105263' arousal='4.03894736842' dominance='5.53421052632'>Beni</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1556'>And now all went cheerfully in the castle. The princess gave to each of the maidens her task, and never was mistress better served. For a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed. They all sang, they danced, they played from morning to night; only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and wan, and the mirror in the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom, while Brunhilda and the rest faded visibly. They assured her that all was well with them; but, nevertheless, they continued to waste away, and day by day it became harder to them to take part in the games of the princess, till at last, one fine morning, when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows, she shuddered and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones, with bent backs and trembling limbs, who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches, and coughed dismally.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1558'>"Malicious Sprite," she cried, "why do you begrudge me my playmates --the greatest delight of my lonely hours?

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1559'>"Sweetest and fairest of damsels," cried the gnome, "do not be angry; everything that is in my power I will do--but do not ask the impossible. So long as the sap was fresh in the roots the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired, but as the sap dried up they withered away. But never trouble yourself about that, dearest one, a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right, and you can speedily call up again every form you wish to see.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1560'>So saying the gnome took himself off. And the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women, and left them the withered roots they really were, to be thrown upon the rubbish heap; and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow to take possession of the freshly filled basket. But to her surprise she could not find it anywhere. Up and down the garden she searched, spying into every corner, but not a sign of it was to be found. By the trellis of grape vines she met the gnome, who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1561'>"You are trying to tease me," she cried, as soon as she saw him. "Where have you hidden the basket? I have been looking for it at least an hour."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1562'>"Dear queen of my heart," answered he, "I pray you to forgive my carelessness. I promised more than I could perform.

Have patience for a little, and then without fail you shall have your puppets to play with."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1563'>Almost before the gnome had finished, the disappointed princess turned away, and marched off to her own apartments, without deigning to answer him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1564'>The gnome, however, set off above ground as speedily as possible, and disguising himself as a farmer, bought an ass in the nearest market-town, and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip, carrot, and radish seed. With this he sowed a great field, and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch and tend it, and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds. Thus fostered they grew and flourished marvellously, and promised a goodly crop.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1565'>The princess wandered about the field day by day, no other plants or fruits in all her wonderful garden pleased her as much as these roots; but still her eyes were full of discontent.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1566'>The gnome tried hard by every means in his power to please the princess and win her love, but little did he guess the real reason of his lack of success. He imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him; but that was a mistake, for the truth was that another image already filled her heart. The young Prince Ratibor, whose lands joined her father"s, had won the heart of the princess; and the lovers had been looking forward to the coming of their wedding-day when the bride"s mysterious disappearance took place. The sad news drove Ratibor distracted, and as the days went on, and nothing could be heard of the princess, he forsook his castle and the society of men, and spent his days in the wild forests, roaming about and crying her name aloud to the trees and rocks. Meanwhile, the maiden, in her gorgeous prison, sighed in secret over her grief, not wishing to arouse the gnome"s suspicions.

Another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well, and could not be seen; and then, with the knowledge only of his faithful Grand Wazeer, to disguise himself as a pedlar, load a donkey with cheap wares, and travel about. In this way he found out what the common people said about him, and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties.</paragraph>

In the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snow-white stag, and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost.

Worse than all evening was already drawing on, and the sun would soon set. In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag. Every shot fell short, or went wide of the mark; and at last, just as darkness was setting in, he lost sight altogether of the beast. By this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue, his hound staggered panting along beside him, he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before, and had quite missed his way, and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1610'>All this was very discouraging, but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful stag.

He toiled over a steep rocky shoulder of a hill, and there, just below him, was a stream dashing down a precipitous glen, and, almost beneath his feet, twinkling and flickering from the level of the torrent, was a dim light as of a lamp. Towards this light the king with his horse and hound made his way, sliding and stumbling down a steep, stony path.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1626'>Now, in a small village in his kingdom there lived an old widow who had no children or relations of any kind. She made her living mostly by selling the milk of a flock of goats; but she was very, very poor, and not very strong, and often used to wonder how she would live if she got too weak or ill to attend to her goats.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1627'>One evening the old woman was astonished to find that her very best nanny-goat returned without a drop of milk. She thought that some naughty boy or girl was playing a trick upon her and had caught the goat on its way home and stolen all the milk. But when evening after evening the goat remained almost dry she determined to find out who the thief was. So the next day she followed the goats at a distance and watched them while they grazed. At length, in the afternoon, the old woman noticed this particular nanny-goat stealing off by herself away from the herd and she at once went after her. On and on the goat walked for some way, and then disappeared into a cave in the rocks. The old woman followed the goat into the cave and then, what should she see but the animal giving her milk to a little boy-baby, whilst on the ground near by lay the sad remains of the baby"s dead mother! Wondering and frightened, the old woman thought at last that this little baby might be a son to her in her old age, and that he would grow up and in time to come be her comfort and support. So she carried home the baby to her hut, and next day she took a spade to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hut;spade;mother;baby;home;grave' adjectives='poor' verbs='carry;dig;bury;take' valence='5.17066666667' arousal='4.304' dominance='5.02666666667'>the cave</entity> and dug a grave where she buried the poor mother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1628'>Years passed by, and the baby grew up into a find handsome lad, as daring as he was beautiful, and as industrious as he was brave. One day, when the boy, whom the old woman had named Nur Mahomed, was about seventeen years old, he was coming from his day"s work in the fields, when he saw a strange donkey eating the cabbages in the garden which surround their little cottage. Seizing a big stick, he began to beat the intruder and to drive him out of his garden. A neighbour passing by called out to him--"Hi! I say! why are you beating the pedlar"s donkey like that?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1631'>A few days later, the pedlar having moved on, two men appeared in the village inquiring who it was who had threatened to ill-treat and to murder an innocent pedlar. They declared that the pedlar, in fear of his life, had complained to the king; and that they had been sent to bring the lawless person who had said these things before the king himself. Of course they soon found out about the donkey eating Nur Mahomed"s cabbages, and about the young man"s hot words; but although the lad assured them that he had never said anything about murdering anyone, they replied they were ordered to arrest him, and bring him to take his trial before the king. So, in spite of his protests, and the wails of his mother, he was carried off, and in due time brought before the king.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1632'>But as he was very angry at what he had been told, he declared that he was going to make an example of this young man, and intended to teach him that even poor travelling pedlars could get justice in HIS country, and be protected from such lawlessness. However, just as he was going to pronounce some very heavy sentence, there was a stir in the court, and up came Nur Mahomed"s old mother, weeping and lamenting, and begging to be heard. The king ordered her to speak, and she began to plead for the boy, declaring how good he was, and how he was the support of her old age, and if he were put in prison she would die. The king asked her who she was. She replied that she was his mother.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1635'>It is easy to guess how, as the story came out, the king looked blacker and blacker, and more and more grim, until at last he was half fainting with rage and astonishment. This, then, was the baby he had left to die, after cruelly murdering his mother! Surely fate might have spared him this! He wished he had sufficient excuse to put the boy to death, for the old hermit"s prophecy came back to him as strongly as ever; and yet the young man had done nothing bad enough to deserve such a punishment. Everyone would call him a tyrant if he were to give such an order--in fact, he dared not try it!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1636'>At length he collected himself enough to say:--"If this young man will enlist in my army I will let him off. We have need of such as him, and a little discipline will do him good." Still the old woman pleaded that she could not live without her son, and was nearly as terrified at the idea of his becoming a soldier as she was at the thought of his being put in prison.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1637'>As a soldier Nur Mahomed seemed to be in luck. He was rather surprised, but much pleased, to find that he was always one of those chosen when any difficult or dangerous enterprise was afoot; and, although he had the narrowest escapes on some occasions, still, the very desperateness of the situations in which he found himself gave him special chances of displaying his courage. And as he was also modest and generous, he became a favourite with his officers and his comrades.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1638'>Thus it was not very surprising that, before very long, he became enrolled amongst the picked men of the king"s bodyguard. The fact is, that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='contrary;method;fact;fight' adjectives='hard;direct;desperate;more' verbs='be;determine;get;try;see;kill;thrive;have;knock;hope' valence='5.418' arousal='4.3795' dominance='5.596'>the king</entity> had hoped to have got him killed in some fight or another; but, seeing that, on the contrary, he throve on hard knocks, he was now determined to try more direct and desperate methods.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1639'>One day, soon after Nur Mahomed had entered the bodyguard, he was selected to be one of the soldiers told off to escort the king through the city. The procession was marching on quite smoothly, when a man, armed with a dagger, rushed out of an alley straight towards the king. Nur Mahomed, who was the nearest of the guards, threw himself in the way, and received the stab that had been apparently intended for the king. Luckily the blow was a hurried one, and the dagger glanced on is breastbone, so that, although he received a severe wound, his youth and strength quickly got the better of it. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='attendant;course;notice;reward;deed' adjectives='own' verbs='oblige;be;make;brave;take' valence='5.97333333333' arousal='3.96083333333' dominance='5.58666666667'>The king</entity> was, of course, obliged to take some notice of this brave deed, and as a reward made him one of his own attendants.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1640'>After this the strange adventures the young man passed through were endless. Officers of the bodyguard were often sent on all sorts of secret and difficult errands, and such errands had a curious way of becoming necessary when Nur Mahomed was on duty. Once, while he was taking a journey, a foot-bridge gave way under him; once he was attacked by armed robbers; a rock rolled down upon him in a mountain pass; a heavy stone coping fell from a roof at his feet in a narrow city alley. Altogether, Nur Mahomed began to think that, somewhere or other, he had made an enemy; but he was light-hearted, and the thought did not much trouble him. He escaped somehow every time, and felt amused rather than anxious about the next adventure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1641'>It was the custom of that city that the officer for the day of the palace guards should receive all his food direct from the king"s kitchen. One day, when Nur Mahomed"s turn came to be on duty, he was just sitting down to a delicious stew that had been sent in from the palace, when one of those gaunt, hungry dogs, which, in eastern countries, run about the streets, poked his nose in at the open guard-room door, and looked at Nur Mahomed with mouth watering and nostrils working. The kind-hearted young man picked out a lump of meat, went to the door, and threw it outside to him. The dog pounced upon it, and gulped it down greedily, and was just turning to go, when it staggered, fell, rolled over, and died. Nur Mahomed, who had been lazily watching him, stood still for a moment, then he came back whistling softly. He gathered up the rest of his dinner and carefully wrapped it up to carry away and bury somewhere; and then he sent back the empty plates.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1642'>How furious the king was when, at the next morning"s durbar, Nur Mahomed appeared before him fresh, alert and smiling as usual. He was determined, however, to try once more, and bidding the young man come into his presence that evening, gave orders that he was to carry a secret despatch to the governor of a distant province. "Make your preparations at once," added he, "and be ready to start in the morning. I myself will deliver you the papers at the last moment."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1643'>Now this province was four or five days" journey from the palace, and the governor of it was the most faithful servant the king had.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1648'>At length he reached the castle gates, and was at once admitted, as he was in the uniform of the king"s bodyguard. The governor was resting, the soldier said, and could not see him until the evening. So Nur Mahomed handed over his horse to an attendant, and wandered down into the lovely gardens he had seen from the road, and sat down in the shade to rest himself. He flung himself on his back and watched the birds twittering and chattering in the trees above him. Through the branches he could see great patches of sky where the kites wheeled and circled incessantly, with shrill whistling cried.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1649'>Every day, through the heat of the afternoon, the governor, and his wife also, used to lie down for two or three hours in their own rooms, and so, for the matter of that, did most people in the palace. But the princess, like many other girls, was restless, and preferred to wander about the garden, rather than rest on a pile of soft cushions. What a torment her stout old attendants and servants sometime thought her when she insisted on staying awake, and making them chatter or do something, when they could hardly keep their eyes open! Sometimes, however, the princess would pretend to go to sleep, and then, after all her women had gladly followed her example, she would get up and go out by herself, her veil hanging loosely about her. If she was discovered her old hostess scolded her severely; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;hostess;time' adjectives='old;same;next' verbs='be;scold;discover;laugh;do' valence='5.778' arousal='4.453' dominance='5.675'>the princess</entity> only laughed, and did the same thing next time.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1650'>This very afternoon the princess had left all her women asleep, and, after trying in vain to amuse herself indoors, she had slipped out into the great garden, and rambled about in all her favourite nooks and corners, feeling quite safe as there was not a creature to be seen. Suddenly, on turning a corner, she stopped in surprise, for before her lay a man fast asleep! In her hurry she had almost tripped over him. But there he was, a young man, tanned and dusty with travel, in the uniform of an officer of the king"s guard. One of the few faults of this lovely princess was a devouring curiosity, and she lived such an idle life that she had plenty of time to be curious. Out of one of the folds of this young man"s turban there peeped the corner of a letter! She wondered what the letter was--whom it was for! She drew her veil a little closer, and stole across on tip-toe and caught hold of the corner of the letter. Then she pulled it a little, and just a little more! A great big seal came into view, which she saw to be her father"s, and at the sight of it she paused for a minute half ashamed of what she was doing. But the pleasure of taking a letter which was not meant for her was more than she could resist, and in another moment it was in her hand. All at once she remembered that it would be death to this poor officer if he lost the letter, and that at all hazards she must put it back again. But this was not so easy; and, moreover, the letter in her hand burnt her with longing to read it, and see what was inside. She examined the seal. It was sticky with being exposed to the hot sun, and with a very little effort it parted from the paper. The letter was open and she read it! And this was what was written:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1651'>"Behead the messenger who brings this letter secretly and at once. Ask no questions."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1652'>The girl grew pale. What a shame! she thought. SHE would not let a handsome young fellow like that be beheaded; but how to prevent it was not quite clear at the moment. Some plan must be invented, and she wished to lock herself in where no one could interrupt her, as might easily happen in the garden. So she crept softly to her room, and took a piece of paper and wrote upon it: "Marry the messenger who brings this letter to the princess openly at once. Ask no questions." And even contrived to work the seals off the original letter and to fix them to this, so that no one could tell, unless they examined it closely, that it had ever been opened. Then she slipped back, shaking with fear and excitement, to where the young officer still lay asleep, thrust the letter into the fold so his turban, and hurried back to her room. It was done!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1653'>Late in the afternoon Nur Mahomed woke, and, making sure that the precious despatch was still safe, went off to get ready for his audience with the governor. As soon as he was ushered into his presence he took the letter from his turban and placed it in the governor"s hands according to orders. When he had read it the governor was certainly a little astonished; but he was told in the letter to "ask no questions," and he knew how to obey orders. He sent for his wife and told her to get <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wife' adjectives='ready' verbs='be;marry;tell;send;get' valence='6.47375' arousal='4.18' dominance='5.625'>the princess</entity> ready to be married at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1654'>"Nonsense!" said his wife, "what in the world do you mean?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1655'>"These are the king"s commands," he answered; "go and do as I bid you. The letter says "at once," and "ask no questions." The marriage, therefore, must take place this evening."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1656'>In vain did his wife urge every objection; the more she argued, the more determined was her husband. "I know how to obey orders," he said, "and these are as plain as the nose on my face!" So the princess was summoned, and, somewhat to their surprise, she seemed to take the news very calmly; next Nur Mahomed was informed, and he was greatly startled, but of course he could but be delighted at the great and unexpected honour which he thought the king had done him. Then all the castle was turned upside down; and when the news spread in the town, THAT was turned upside down too. Everybody ran everywhere, and tried to do everything at once; and, in the middle of it all, the old governor went about with his hair standing on end, muttering something about "obeying orders."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1657'>And so the marriage was celebrated, and there was a great feast in the castle, and another in the soldiers" barracks, and illuminations all over the town and in the beautiful gardens.

Then, after awhile, he began to think he had better make the best of it, especially as the old governor had been clever enough to send him back his letter, and the king was pretty sure that this was in the princess"s handwriting. He was fond of his daughter, and though she had behaved badly, he did not wish to cut HER head off, and he did not want people to know the truth because it would make him look foolish. In fact, the more he considered the matter, the more he felt that he would be wise to put a good face on it, and to let people suppose that he had really brought about the marriage of his own free will.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1666'>Once upon a time there lived a poor old man whose name was Wali Dad Gunjay, or Wali Dad the Bald. He had no relations, but lived all by himself in a little mud hut some distance from any town, and made his living by cutting grass in the jungle, and selling it as fodder for horses. He only earned by this five halfpence a day; but he was a simple old man, and needed so little out of it, that he saved up one halfpenny daily, and spent the rest upon such food and clothing as he required.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1667'>In this way he lived for many years until, one night, he thought that he would count the money he had hidden away in the great earthen pot under the floor of his hut. So he set to work, and with much trouble he pulled the bag out on to the floor, and sat gazing in astonishment at the heap of coins which tumbled out of it. What should he do with them all? he wondered. But he never thought of spending the money on himself, because he was content to pass the rest of his days as he had been doing for ever so long, and he really had no desire for any greater comfort or luxury.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1668'>At last he threw all the money into an old sack, which he pushed under his bead, and then, rolled in his ragged old blanket, he went off to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1669'>Early next morning he staggered off with his sack of money to the shop of a jeweller, whom he knew in the town, and bargained with him for a beautiful little gold bracelet. With this carefully wrapped up in his cotton waistband he went to the house of a rich friend, who was a travelling merchant, and used to wander about with his camels and merchandise through many countries. Wali Dad was lucky enough to find him at home, so he sat down, and after a little talk he asked the merchant who was the most virtuous and beautiful lady he had ever met with. The merchant replied that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='merchant;beauty;generosity;person;disposition;kindness' adjectives='renowned' verbs='reply;be' valence='6.487' arousal='4.023' dominance='5.917'>the princess</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;beauty;generosity;person;disposition;kindness' adjectives='renowned' verbs='reply;be' valence='6.487' arousal='4.023' dominance='5.917'>Khaistan</entity> was renowned everywhere as well for the beauty of her person as for the kindness and generosity of her disposition.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1671'>With that he pulled the bracelet from his waistband, and handed it to his friend. The merchant was naturally much astonished, but said nothing, and made no objection to carrying out his friend"s plan.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1673'>The princess could not think who could have bestowed this present on her, but she bade her servant to tell the merchant that if he would return, after he had finished his business in the city, she would give him her reply. In a few days, therefore, the merchant came back, and received from the princess a return present in the shape of a camel-load or rich silks, besides a present of money for himself. With these he set out on his journey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1674'>Some months later he got home again from his journeyings, and proceeded to take Wali Dad the princess"s present. Great was the perplexity of the good man to find a camel-load of silks tumbled at his door! What was he to do with these costly things? But, presently, after much thought, he begged the merchant to consider whether he did not know of some young prince to whom such treasures might be useful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='1675'>"Of course," cried the merchant, greatly amused; "from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;course;none;nekabad;prince' adjectives='worthier;gallant;young;wealthy' verbs='amuse;cry;live;know' valence='5.975' arousal='4.644' dominance='5.247'>Delhi</entity> to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;course;none;nekabad;prince' adjectives='worthier;gallant;young;wealthy' verbs='amuse;cry;live;know' valence='5.975' arousal='4.644' dominance='5.247'>Baghdad</entity>, and from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;course;none;nekabad;prince' adjectives='worthier;gallant;young;wealthy' verbs='amuse;cry;live;know' valence='5.975' arousal='4.644' dominance='5.247'>Constantinople</entity> to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;course;none;nekabad;prince' adjectives='worthier;gallant;young;wealthy' verbs='amuse;cry;live;know' valence='5.975' arousal='4.644' dominance='5.247'>Lucknow</entity>, I know them all; and there lives none worthier than the gallant and wealthy young prince of Nekabad."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1676'>"Very well, then, take the silks to him, with the blessing of an old man," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='blessing;silk;man' adjectives='relieved;rid;much;old' verbs='be;say;take' valence='5.506' arousal='4.274' dominance='5.47'>Wali Dad</entity>, much relieved to be rid of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1677'>So, the next time that the merchant journeyed that way he carried the silks with him, and in due course arrived at Nekabad, and sought an audience of the prince. When he was shown into his presence he produced the beautiful gift of silks that Wali Dad had sent, and begged the young man to accept them as a humble tribute to his worth and greatness. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='merchant;horse;return;service;country;breed;leave;generosity;reward;giver' adjectives='finest;famous;munificent;much' verbs='be;give;deliver;take;touch;order' valence='6.07541666667' arousal='4.16166666667' dominance='5.79125'>The prince</entity> was much touched by the generosity of the giver, and ordered, as a return present, twelve of the finest breed of horses for which his country was famous to be delivered over to the merchant, to whom also, before he took his leave, he gave a munificent reward for his services.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1678'>As before, the merchant at last arrived at home; and next day, he set out for Wali Dad"s house with the twelve horses. When the old man saw them coming in the distance he said to himself: "Here"s luck! a troop of horses coming! They are sure to want quantities of grass, and I shall sell all I have without having to drag it to market." Thereupon he rushed off and cut grass as fast he could. When he got back, with as much grass as he could possibly carry, he was greatly discomfited to find that the horses were all for himself. At first he could not think what to do with them, but, after a little, a brilliant idea struck him! He gave two to the merchant, and begged him to take the rest to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='merchant;person;animal;rest' adjectives='beautiful;such;fittest' verbs='take;be;possess;beg;give' valence='6.24166666667' arousal='4.13' dominance='5.37083333333'>the princess</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;person;animal;rest' adjectives='beautiful;such;fittest' verbs='take;be;possess;beg;give' valence='6.24166666667' arousal='4.13' dominance='5.37083333333'>Khaistan</entity>, who was clearly the fittest person to possess such beautiful animals.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1679'>The merchant departed, laughing. But, true to his old friend"s request, he took the horses with him on his next journey, and eventually presented them safely to the princess. This time the princess sent for the merchant, and questioned him about the giver. Now, the merchant was usually a most honest man, but he did not quite like to describe Wali Dad in his true light as an old man whose income was five halfpence a day, and who had hardly clothes to cover him. So he told her that his friend had heard stories of her beauty and goodness, and had longed to lay the best he had at her feet. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='confidence;father;courtesy;present' adjectives='such' verbs='return;make;beg;take;persist;advise' valence='5.97666666667' arousal='4.00666666667' dominance='5.69833333333'>The princess</entity> then took her father into her confidence, and begged him to advise her what courtesy she might return to one who persisted in making her such presents.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1680'>"Well," said the king, "you cannot refuse them; so the best thing you can do is to send this unknown friend at once a present so magnificent that he is not likely to be able to send you anything better, and so will be ashamed to send anything at all!" Then he ordered that, in place of each of the ten horses, two mules laden with silver should be returned by her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1681'>Thus, in a few hours, the merchant found himself in charge of a splendid caravan; and he had to hire a number of armed men to defend it on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;caravan;number;s;charge;robber;man' adjectives='armed;splendid;glad' verbs='be;hire;defend;hut;have;find' valence='5.61833333333' arousal='4.19125' dominance='5.70208333333'>the road</entity> against the robbers, and he was glad indeed to find himself back again in <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='merchant;caravan;number;s;charge;robber;man' adjectives='armed;splendid;glad' verbs='be;hire;defend;hut;have;find' valence='5.61833333333' arousal='4.19125' dominance='5.70208333333'>Wali Dad</entity>"s hut.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1682'>"Well, now," cried Wali Dad, as he viewed all the wealth laid at his door, "I can well repay that kind prince for his magnificent present of horses; but to be sure you have been put to great expenses! Still, if you will accept six mules and their loads, and will take the rest straight to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='load;rest;mule' adjectives='' verbs='take;accept;thank' valence='5.62545454545' arousal='3.43363636364' dominance='5.84636363636'>Nekabad</entity>, I shall thank you heartily."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1683'>The merchant felt handsomely repaid for his trouble, and wondered greatly how the matter would turn out. So he made no difficulty about it; and as soon as he could get things ready, he set out for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='difficulty;gift;thing' adjectives='ready;new;princely' verbs='make;set;get' valence='5.89' arousal='3.97' dominance='5.66625'>Nekabad</entity> with this new and princely gift.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1684'>This time the prince, too, was embarrassed, and questioned the merchant closely. The merchant felt that his credit was at stake, and whilst inwardly determining that he would not carry the joke any further, could not help describing Wali Dad in such glowing terms that the old man would never have known himself had he heard them. The prince, like the king of Khaistan, determined that he would send in return a gift that would be truly royal, and which would perhaps prevent the unknown giver sending him anything more. So he made up a caravan on twenty splendid horses caparisoned in gold embroidered cloths, with fine morocco saddles and silver bridles and stirrups, also twenty camels of the best breed, which had the speed of race-horses, and could swing along at a trot all day without getting tired; and, lastly, twenty elephants, with magnificent silver howdahs and coverings of silk embroidered with pearls. To take care of these animals the merchant hired a little army of men; and the troop made a great show as they travelled along.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1685'>When Wali Dad from a distance saw the cloud of dust which the caravan made, and the glitter of its appointments, he said to himself: "By Allah! here"s a grand crowd coming! Elephants, too! Grass will be selling well to-day!" And with that he hurried off to the jungle and cut grass as fast as he could. As soon as he got back he found the caravan had stopped at his door, and the merchant was waiting, a little anxiously, to tell him the news and to congratulate him upon his riches.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1686'>"Riches!" cried Wali Dad, "what has an old man like me with one foot in the grave to do with riches? That beautiful young princess, now! She"d be the one to enjoy all these fine things! Do you take for yourself two horses, two camels, and two elephants, with all their trappings, and present the rest to her."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1687'>The merchant at first objected to these remarks, and pointed out to Wali Dad that he was beginning to feel these embassies a little awkward. Of course he was himself richly repaid, so far as expenses went; but still he did not like going so often, and he was getting nervous. At length, however he consented to go once more, but he promised himself never to embark on another such enterprise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1688'>So, after a few days" rest, the caravan started off once more for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='caravan;rest' adjectives='more' verbs='start' valence='6.298' arousal='3.904' dominance='5.492'>Khaistan</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1689'>The moment the king of Khaistan saw the gorgeous train of men and beasts entering his palace courtyard, he was so amazed that he hurried down in person to inquire about it, and became dumb when he heard that these also were a present from the princely Wali Dad, and were for the princess, his daughter. He went hastily off to her apartments, and said to her: "I tell you what it is, my dear, this man wants to marry you; that is the meaning of all these presents! There is nothing for it but that we go and pay him a visit in person. He must be a man of immense wealth, and as he is so devoted to you, perhaps you might do worse than marry him!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1690'>The princess agreed with all that her father said, and orders were issued for vast numbers of elephants and camels, and gorgeous tents and flags, and litters for the ladies, and horses for the men, to be prepared without delay, as the king and princess were going to pay a visit to the great and munificent prince Wali Dad. The merchant, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='merchant;party' adjectives='' verbs='be;declare;guide' valence='5.90333333333' arousal='4.22833333333' dominance='5.66833333333'>the king</entity> declared, was to guide the party.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1691'>The feelings of the poor merchant in this sore dilemma can hardly be imagined. Willingly would he have run away; but he was treated with so much hospitality as Wali Dad"s representative, that he hardly got an instant"s real peace, and never any opportunity of slipping away. In fact, after a few days, despair possessed him to such a degree that he made up his mind that all that happened was fate, and that escape was impossible; but he hoped devoutly some turn of fortune would reveal to him a way out of the difficulties which he had, with the best intentions, drawn upon himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1692'>On the seventh day they all started, amidst thunderous salutes from the ramparts of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='rampart;dust;blaring;salute' adjectives='much;thunderous' verbs='start;cheer;trumpet' valence='5.87' arousal='4.34875' dominance='5.57875'>the city</entity>, and much dust, and cheering, and blaring of trumpets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1693'>Day after day they moved on, and every day the poor merchant felt more ill and miserable. He wondered what kind of death <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='executioner;kind;death;neck;s;situation;whole' adjectives='much' verbs='be;set;torture;work;invent;lay;have;go;suffer;think;wonder' valence='5.3775' arousal='4.32916666667' dominance='5.45916666667'>the king</entity> would invent for him, and went through almost as much torture, as he lay awake nearly the whole of every night thinking over the situation, as he would have suffered if <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='executioner;kind;death;neck;s;situation;whole' adjectives='much' verbs='be;set;torture;work;invent;lay;have;go;suffer;think;wonder' valence='5.3775' arousal='4.32916666667' dominance='5.45916666667'>the king</entity>"s executioners were already setting to work upon his neck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1694'>At last they were only one day"s march from Wali Dad"s little mud home. Here a great encampment was made, and the merchant was sent on to tell Wali Dad that the King and Princess of Khaistan had arrived and were seeking an interview. When the merchant arrived he found the poor old man eating his evening meal of onions and dry bread, and when he told him of all that had happened he had not the heart to proceed to load him with the reproaches which rose to his tongue. For Wali Dad was overwhelmed with grief and shame for himself, for his friend, and for the name and honour of the princess; and he wept and plucked at his beard, and groaned most piteously. With tears he begged the merchant to detain them for one day by any kind of excuse he could think of, and to come in the morning to discuss what they should do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1695'>As soon as the merchant was gone Wali Dad made up his mind that there was only one honourable way out of the shame and distress that he had created by his foolishness, and that was--to kill himself. So, without stopping to ask any one"s advice, he went off in the middle of the night to a place where the river wound along at the base of steep rocky cliffs of great height, and determined to throw himself down and put an end to his life. When he got to the place he drew back a few paces, took a little run, and at the very edge of that dreadful black gulf he stopped short! He COULD not do it!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1696'>From below, unseen in the blackness of the deep night shadows, the water roared and boiled round the jagged rocks--he could picture the place as he knew it, only ten times more pitiless and forbidding in the visionless darkness; the wind soughed through the gorge with fearsome sighs, and rustlings and whisperings, and the bushes and grasses that grew in the ledges of the cliffs seemed to him like living creatures that danced and beckoned, shadowy and indistinct. An owl laughed "Hoo! hoo!" almost in his face, as he peered over the edge of the gulf, and the old man threw himself back in a perspiration of horror. He was afraid! He drew back shuddering, and covering his face in his hands he wept aloud.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1697'>Presently he was aware of a gentle radiance that shed itself before him. Surely morning was not already coming to hasten and reveal his disgrace! He took his hands from before his face, and saw before him two lovely beings whom his instinct told him were not mortal, but were <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='being;instinct;face;paradise;hand' adjectives='lovely;mortal' verbs='be;see;take;tell' valence='5.815' arousal='4.00666666667' dominance='5.5625'>Peris</entity> from Paradise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1698'>"Why do you weep, old man?" said one, in a voice as clear and musical as that of the bulbul.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1699'>"I weep for shame," replied he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1700'>"What do you here?" questioned the other.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1701'>"I came here to die," said Wali Dad. And as they questioned him, he confessed all his story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1702'>Then the first stepped forward and laid a hand upon his shoulder, and Wali Dad began to feel that something strange--what, he did not know--was happening to him. His old cotton rags of clothes were changed to beautiful linen and embroidered cloth; on his hard, bare feet were warm, soft shoes, and on his head a great jewelled turban. Round his neck there lay a heavy golden chain, and the little old bent sickle, which he cut grass with, and which hung in his waistband, had turned into a gorgeous scimetar, whose ivory hilt gleamed in the pale light like snow in moonlight. As he stood wondering, like a man in a dream, the other peri waved her hand and bade him turn and see; and, lo! before him a noble gateway stood open. And up an avenue of giant place trees the peris led him, dumb with amazement. At the end of the avenue, on the very spot where his hut had stood, a gorgeous palace appeared, ablaze with myriads of lights. Its great porticoes and verandahs were occupied by hurrying servants, and guards paced to and fro and saluted him respectfully as he drew near, along mossy walks and through sweeping grassy lawns where fountains were playing and flowers scented the air. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='helpless;stunned' verbs='stand' valence='4.88333333333' arousal='4.02' dominance='5.00333333333'>Wali Dad</entity> stood stunned and helpless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1703'>"Fear not," said one of the peris; "go to your house, and learn that God rewards the simple-hearted."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1704'>With these words they both disappeared and left him. He walked on, thinking still that he must be dreaming. Very soon he retired to rest in a splendid room, far grander than anything he had ever dreamed of.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1705'>When morning dawned he woke, and found that <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='servant' adjectives='real' verbs='be;dawn;wake;find;dream' valence='6.315' arousal='3.809' dominance='5.568'>the palace</entity>, and himself, and his servants were all real, and that he was not dreaming after all!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1706'>If he was dumbfounded, the merchant, who was ushered into his presence soon after sunrise, was much more so. He told Wali Dad that he had not slept all night, and by the first streak of daylight had started to seek out his friend. And what a search he had had! A great stretch of wild jungle country had, in the night, been changed into parks and gardens; and if it had not been for some of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='impression;garden;imagination;stretch;country;park;servant;s;jungle;trouble' adjectives='wild;new;great;crazy' verbs='be;send;bring;see;have;flee;find;change' valence='5.8328125' arousal='4.1409375' dominance='5.5321875'>Wali Dad</entity>"s new servants, who found him and brought him to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='impression;garden;imagination;stretch;country;park;servant;s;jungle;trouble' adjectives='wild;new;great;crazy' verbs='be;send;bring;see;have;flee;find;change' valence='5.8328125' arousal='4.1409375' dominance='5.5321875'>the palace</entity>, he would have fled away under the impression that his trouble had sent him crazy, and that all he saw was only imagination.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1707'>Then Wali Dad told the merchant all that had happened.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1714'>Tale of a Tortoise and of a Mischievous Monkey</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1715'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1716'>Once upon a time there was a country where the rivers were larger, and the forests deeper, than anywhere else. Hardly any men came there, and the wild creatures had it all to themselves, and used to play all sorts of strange games with each other. The great trees, chained one to the other by thick flowering plants with bright scarlet or yellow blossoms, were famous hiding-places for the monkeys, who could wait unseen, till a puma or an elephant passed by, and then jump on their backs and go for a ride, swinging themselves up by the creepers when they had had enough. Near the rivers huge tortoises were to be found, and though to our eyes a tortoise seems a dull, slow thing, it is wonderful to think how clever they were, and how often they outwitted many of their livelier friends.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1717'>There was one tortoise in particular that always managed to get the better of everybody, and many were the tales told in the forest of his great deeds. They began when he was quite young, and tired of staying at home with his father and mother. He left them one day, and walked off in search of adventures. In a wide open space surrounded by trees he met with an elephant, who was having his supper before taking his evening bath in the river which ran close by. "Let us see which of us two is strongest," said the young tortoise, marching up to the elephant. "Very well," replied the elephant, much amused at the impertinence of the little creature; "when would you like the trial to be?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1718'>"In an hour"s time; I have some business to do first," answered the tortoise. And he hastened away as fast as his short legs would carry him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1719'>In a pool of the river a whale was resting, blowing water into the air and making a lovely fountain. The tortoise, however, was too young and too busy to admire such things, and he called to the whale to stop, as he wanted to speak to him. "Would you like to try which of us is the stronger?" said he. The whale looked at him, sent up another fountain, and answered: "Oh, yes; certainly. When do you wish to begin? I am quite ready."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1720'>"Then give me one of your longest bones, and I will fasten it to my leg. When I give the signal, you must pull, and we will see which can pull the hardest."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1721'>"Very good," replied the whale; and he took out one of his bones and passed it to the tortoise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1722'>The tortoise picked up the end of the bone in his mouth and went back to the elephant. "I will fasten this to your leg," said he, "in the same way as it is fastened to mine, and we must both pull as hard as we can. We shall soon see which is the stronger." So he wound it carefully round the elephant"s leg, and tied it in a firm knot. "Now!" cried he, plunging into a thick <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='thick' verbs='plunge;cry' valence='4.444' arousal='4.17' dominance='4.434'>bush</entity> behind him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1723'>The whale tugged at one end, and the elephant tugged at the other, and neither had any idea that he had not the tortoise for his foe. When the whale pulled hardest the elephant was dragged into the water; and when the elephant pulled the hardest the whale was hauled on to the land. They were very evenly matched, and the battle was a hard one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1724'>At last they were quite tired, and the tortoise, who was watching, saw that they could play no more. So he crept from his hiding-place, and dipping himself in the river, he went to the elephant and said: "I see that you really are stronger than I thought. Suppose we give it up for to-day?" Then he dried himself on some moss and went to the whale and said: "I see that you really are stronger than I thought. Suppose we give it up for to-day?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1725'>The two adversaries were only too glad to be allowed to rest, and believed to the end of their days that, after all, the tortoise was stronger than either of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1726'>A day or two later the young tortoise was taking a stroll, when he met a fox, and stopped to speak to him. "Let us try," said he in a careless manner, "which of us can lie buried in the ground during seven years."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1727'>"I shall be delighted," answered the fox, "only I would rather that you began."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1728'>"It is all the same to me," replied the tortoise; "if you come round this way to-morrow you will see that I have fulfilled my part of the bargain."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1729'>So he looked about for a suitable place, and found a convenient hole at the foot of an orange tree. He crept into it, and the next morning the fox heaped up the earth round him, and promised to feed him every day with fresh fruit. The fox so far kept his word that each morning when the sun rose he appeared to ask how the tortoise was getting on. "Oh, very well; but I wish you would give me some fruit," replied he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1730'>"Alas! the fruit is not ripe enough yet for you to eat," answered the fox, who hoped that the tortoise would die of hunger long before the seven years were over.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1731'>"Oh dear, oh dear! I am so hungry!" cried the tortoise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1732'>"I am sure you must be; but it will be all right to-morrow," said the fox, trotting off, not knowing that the oranges dropped down the hollow trunk, straight into the tortoise"s hole, and that he had as many as he could possibly eat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1733'>So the seven years went by; and when the tortoise came out of his hole he was as fat as ever.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1734'>Now it was the fox"s turn, and he chose his hole, and the tortoise heaped the earth round, promising to return every day or two with a nice young bird for his dinner. "Well, how are you getting on?" he would ask cheerfully when he paid his visits.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1735'>"Oh, all right; only I wish you had brought a bird with you," answered the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1736'>"I have been so unlucky, I have never been able to catch one," replied the tortoise. "However, I shall be more fortunate to-morrow, I am sure."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1737'>But not many to-morrows after, when the tortoise arrived with his usual question: "Well, how are you getting on?" he received no answer, for the fox was lying in his hole quite still, dead of hunger.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1738'>By this time the tortoise was grown up, and was looked up to throughout the forest as a person to be feared for his strength and wisdom. But he was not considered a very swift runner, until an adventure with a deer added to his fame.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1739'>One day, when he was basking in the sun, a stag passed by, and stopped for a little conversation. "Would you care to see which of us can run fastest?" asked the tortoise, after some talk. The stag thought the question so silly that he only shrugged his shoulders. "Of course, the victor would have the right to kill the other," went on the tortoise. "Oh, on that condition I agree," answered the deer; "but I am afraid you are a dead man."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1740'>"It is no use trying to frighten me," replied the tortoise. "But I should like three days for training; then I shall be ready to start when the sun strikes on the big tree at the edge of the great clearing."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1741'>The first thing the tortoise did was to call his brothers and his cousins together, and he posted them carefully under ferns all along the line of the great clearing, making a sort of ladder which stretched for many miles. This done to his satisfaction, he went back to the starting place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1742'>The stag was quite punctual, and as soon as the sun"s rays struck the trunk of the tree the stag started off, and was soon far out of the sight of the tortoise. Every now and then he would turn his head as he ran, and call out: "How are you getting on?" and the tortoise who happened to be nearest at that moment would answer: "All right, I am close up to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1743'>Full of astonishment, the stag would redouble his efforts, but it was no use. Each time he asked: "Are you there?" the answer would come: "Yes, of course, where else should I be?" And the stag ran, and ran, and ran, till he could run no more, and dropped down dead on the grass.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1744'>And the tortoise, when he thinks about it, laughs still.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1745'>But the tortoise was not the only creature of whose tricks stories were told in the forest. There was a famous monkey who was just as clever and more mischievous, because he was so much quicker on his feet and with his hands. It was quite impossible to catch him and give him the thrashing he so often deserved, for he just swung himself up into a tree and laughed at the angry victim who was sitting below. Sometimes, however, the inhabitants of the forest were so foolish as to provoke him, and then they got the worst of it. This was what happened to the barber, whom the monkey visited one morning, saying that he wished to be shaved. The barber bowed politely to his customer, and begging him to be seated, tied a large cloth round his neck, and rubbed his chin with soap; but instead of cutting off his beard, the barber made a snip at the end of his tail. It was only a very little bit and the monkey started up more in rage than in pain. "Give me back the end of my tail," he roared, "or I will take one of your razors." The barber refused to give back the missing piece, so the monkey caught up a razor from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mile;razor;piece;barber;monkey' adjectives='' verbs='shave;be;refuse;run;give;get;catch;miss' valence='5.52772727273' arousal='3.79136363636' dominance='5.49363636364'>the table</entity> and ran away with it, and no one in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mile;razor;piece;barber;monkey' adjectives='' verbs='shave;be;refuse;run;give;get;catch;miss' valence='5.52772727273' arousal='3.79136363636' dominance='5.49363636364'>the forest</entity> could be shaved for days, as there was not another to be got for miles and miles.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1746'>As he was making his way to his own particular palm-tree, where the cocoanuts grew, which were so useful for pelting passers-by, he met a woman who was scaling a fish with a bit of wood, for in this side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hut;woman;people;fish;passer-by;cocoanut;palm-tree;wood;way;bit;side' adjectives='few;own;useful;particular' verbs='be;scale;pelt;make;live;meet;grow' valence='5.91541666667' arousal='3.84875' dominance='5.6825'>the forest</entity> a few people lived in huts near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hut;woman;people;fish;passer-by;cocoanut;palm-tree;wood;way;bit;side' adjectives='few;own;useful;particular' verbs='be;scale;pelt;make;live;meet;grow' valence='5.91541666667' arousal='3.84875' dominance='5.6825'>the river</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1747'>"That must be hard work," said the monkey, stopping to look; "try my knife--you will get on quicker." And he handed her the razor as he spoke. A few days later he came back and rapped at the door of the hut. "I have called for my razor," he said, when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='razor' adjectives='' verbs='say;call;appear;have' valence='5.74142857143' arousal='3.93' dominance='5.77571428571'>the woman</entity> appeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1748'>"I have lost it," answered she.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1749'>"If you don"t give it to me at once I will take your sardine," replied the monkey, who did not believe her. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sardine;knife' adjectives='' verbs='protest;run;take;have;get' valence='5.4075' arousal='4.2175' dominance='5.39625'>The woman</entity> protested she had not got the knife, so he took the sardine and ran off.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1750'>A little further along he saw a baker who was standing at the door, eating one of his loaves. "That must be rather dry," said the monkey, "try my fish"; and the man did not need twice telling. A few days later the monkey stopped again at the baker"s hut. "I"ve called for that fish," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1751'>"That fish? But I have eaten it!" exclaimed the baker in dismay.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1752'>"If you have eaten it I shall take this barrel of meal in exchange," replied the monkey; and he walked off with the barrel under his arm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1753'>As he went he saw a woman with a group of little girls round her, teaching them how to dress hair. "Here is something to make cakes for the children," he said, putting down his barrel, which by this time he found rather heavy. The children were delighted, and ran directly to find some flat stones to bake their cakes on, and when they had made and eaten them, they thought they had never tasted anything so nice. Indeed, when they saw the monkey approaching not long after, they rushed to meet him, hoping that he was bringing them some more presents. But he took no notice of their questions, he only said to their mother: "I"ve called for my barrel of meal."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1754'>"Why, you gave it to me to make cakes of!" cried the mother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1755'>"If I can"t get my barrel of meal, I shall take one of your children," answered the monkey. "I am in want of somebody who can bake my bread when I am tired of fruit, and who knows how to make cocoanut cakes."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1756'>"Oh, leave me my child, and I will find you another barrel of meal," wept the mother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1757'>"I don"t WANT another barrel, I want THAT one," answered the monkey sternly. And as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;girl;palm;tree;hand' adjectives='prettiest;little' verbs='catch;take;wring;stand;think' valence='6.2175' arousal='3.83333333333' dominance='5.69166666667'>the woman</entity> stood wringing her hands, he caught up the little girl that he thought the prettiest and took her to his home in the palm tree.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1758'>She never went back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='everything;tree;monkey;deal;child' adjectives='good;much;whole;great' verbs='pity;be;play;fly;know;swing;go;teach;climb' valence='6.25608695652' arousal='3.79913043478' dominance='5.69652173913'>the hut</entity>, but on the whole she was not much to be pitied, for monkeys are nearly as good as children to play with, and they taught her how to swing, and to climb, and to fly from tree to tree, and everything else they knew, which was a great deal.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1759'>Now the monkey"s tiresome tricks had made him many enemies in the forest, but no one hated him so much as the puma. The cause of their quarrel was known only to themselves, but everybody was aware of the fact, and took care to be out of the way when there was any chance of these two meeting. Often and often the puma had laid traps for the monkey, which he felt sure his foe could not escape; and the monkey would pretend that he saw nothing, and rejoice the hidden puma"s heart by seeming to walk straight into the snare, when, lo! a loud laugh would be heard, and the monkey"s grinning face would peer out of a mass of creepers and disappear before his foe could reach him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1760'>This state of things had gone on for quite a long while, when at last there came a season such as the oldest parrot in the forest could never remember. Instead of two or three hundred inches of rain falling, which they were all accustomed to, month after month passed without a cloud, and the rivers and springs dried up, till there was only one small pool left for everyone to drink from. There was not an animal for miles round that did not grieve over this shocking condition of affairs, not one at least except the puma. His only thought for years had been how to get the monkey into his power, and this time he imagined his chance had really arrived. He would hide himself in a thicket, and when the monkey came down to drink--and come he must--the puma would spring out and seize him. Yes, on this occasion there could be no escape!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1761'>And no more there would have been if the puma had had greater patience; but in his excitement he moved a little too soon. The monkey, who was stooping to drink, heard a rustling, and turning caught the gleam of two yellow, murderous eyes. With a mighty spring he grasped a creeper which was hanging above him, and landed himself on the branch of a tree; feeling the breath of the puma on his feet as the animal bounded from is cover. Never had the monkey been so near death, and it was some time before he recovered enough courage to venture on the ground again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1762'>Up there in the shelter of the trees, he began to turn over in his head plans for escaping the snares of the puma. And at length chance helped him. Peeping down to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='gourd;honey;head;man' adjectives='large' verbs='carry;peep;come;see;fill' valence='5.54571428571' arousal='4.30642857143' dominance='5.38071428571'>the earth</entity>, he saw a man coming along <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='gourd;honey;head;man' adjectives='large' verbs='carry;peep;come;see;fill' valence='5.54571428571' arousal='4.30642857143' dominance='5.38071428571'>the path</entity> carrying on his head a large gourd filled with honey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1763'>He waited till the man was just underneath the tree, then he hung from a bough, and caught the gourd while the man looked up wondering, for he was no tree-climber. Then the monkey rubbed the honey all over him, and a quantity of leaves from a creeper that was hanging close by; he stuck them all close together into the honey, so that he looked like a walking bush. This finished, he ran to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='search;result;adventure' adjectives='pleased' verbs='see;finish;run;set' valence='6.44333333333' arousal='4.25555555556' dominance='6.04555555556'>the pool</entity> to see the result, and, quite pleased with himself, set out in search of adventures.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1764'>Soon the report went through the forest that a new animal had appeared from no one knew where, and that when somebody had asked his name, the strange creature had answered that it was Jack-in-the-Green. Thanks to this, the monkey was allowed to drink at the pool as often as he liked, for neither beast nor bird had the faintest notion who he was. And if they made any inquiries the only answer they got was that the water of which he had drunk deeply had turned his hair into leaves, so that they all knew what would happen in case they became too greedy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1765'>By-and-by the great rains began again. The rivers and streams filled up, and there was no need for him to go back to the pool, near the home of his enemy, the puma, as there was a large number of places for him to choose from. So one night, when everything was still and silent, and even the chattering parrots were asleep on one leg, the monkey stole down softly from his perch, and washed off the honey and the leaves, and came out from his bath in his own proper skin. On his way to breakfast he met a rabbit, and stopped for a little talk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1766'>"I am feeling rather dull," he remarked; "I think it would do me good to hunt a while. What do you say?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1767'>"Oh, I am quite willing," answered the rabbit, proud of being spoken to by such a large creature. "But the question is, what shall we hunt?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1768'>"There is no credit in going after an elephant or a tiger," replied the monkey stroking his chin, "they are so big they could not possibly get out of your way. It shows much more skill to be able to catch a small thing that can hide itself in a moment behind a leaf. I"ll tell you what! Suppose I hunt butterflies, and you, serpents."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1769'>The rabbit, who was young and without experience, was delighted with this idea, and they both set out on their various ways.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1770'>The monkey quietly climbed up the nearest tree, and ate fruit most of the day, but the rabbit tired himself to death poking his nose into every heap of dried leaves he saw, hoping to find a serpent among them. Luckily for himself the serpents were all away for the afternoon, at a meeting of their own, for there is nothing a serpent likes so well for dinner as a nice plump rabbit. But, as it was, the dried leaves were all empty, and the rabbit at last fell asleep where he was. Then the monkey, who had been watching him, fell down and pulled his ears, to the rage of the rabbit, who vowed vengeance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1771'>It was not easy to catch the monkey off his guard, and the rabbit waited long before an opportunity arrived. But one day Jack-in-the-Green was sitting on a stone, wondering what he should do next, when the rabbit crept softly behind him, and gave his tail a sharp pull. The monkey gave a shriek of pain, and darted up into a tree, but when he saw that it was only the rabbit who had dared to insult him so, he chattered so fast in his anger, and looked so fierce, that the rabbit fled into the nearest hole, and stayed there for several days, trembling with fright.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1772'>Soon after this adventure the monkey went away into another part of the country, right on the outskirts of the forest, where there was a beautiful garden full of oranges hanging ripe from the trees. This garden was a favourite place for birds of all kinds, each hoping to secure an orange for dinner, and in order to frighten the birds away and keep a little fruit for himself, the master had fastened a waxen figure on one of the boughs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1773'>Now the monkey was as fond of oranges as any of the birds, and when he saw a man standing in the tree where the largest and sweetest oranges grew, he spoke to him at once. "You man," he said rudely, "throw me down that big orange up there, or I will throw a stone at you." The wax figure took no notice of this request, so the monkey, who was easily made angry, picked up a stone, and flung it with all his force. But instead of falling to the ground again, the stone stuck to the soft wax.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1774'>At this moment a breeze shook the tree, and the orange on which the monkey had set his heart dropped from the bough. He picked it up and ate it every bit, including the rind, and it was so good he thought he should like another. So he called again to the wax figure to throw him an orange, and as the figure did not move, he hurled another stone, which stuck to the wax as the first had done. Seeing that the man was quite indifferent to stones, the monkey grew more angry still, and climbing the tree hastily, gave the figure a violent kick. But like the two stones his leg remained stuck to the wax, and he was held fast. "Let me go at once, or I will give you another kick," he cried, suiting the action to the word, and this time also his foot remained in the grasp of the man. Not knowing what he did, the monkey hit out, first with one hand and then with the other, and when he found that he was literally bound hand and foot, he became so mad with anger and terror that in his struggles he fell to the ground, dragging the figure after him. This freed his hands and feet, but besides the shock of the fall, they had tumbled into a bed of thorns, and he limped away broken and bruised, and groaning loudly; for when monkeys ARE hurt, they take pains that everybody shall know it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1775'>It was a long time before Jack was well enough to go about again; but when he did, he had an encounter with his old enemy the puma. And this was how it came about.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1776'>One day the puma invited his friend the stag to go with him and see a comrade, who was famous for the good milk he got from his cows. The stag loved milk, and gladly accepted the invitation, and when the sun began to get a little low the two started on their walk. On the way they arrived on the banks of a river, and as there were no bridges in those days it was necessary to swim across it. The stag was not fond of swimming, and began to say that he was tired, and thought that after all it was not worth going so far to get milk, and that he would return home. But the puma easily saw through these excuses, and laughed at him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1777'>"The river is not deep at all," he said; "why, you will never be off your feet. Come, pluck up your courage and follow me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1778'>The stag was afraid of the river; still, he was much more afraid of being laughed at, and he plunged in after the puma; but in an instant the current had swept him away, and if it had not borne him by accident to a shallow place on the opposite side, where he managed to scramble up the bank, he would certainly have been drowned. As it was, he scrambled out, shaking with terror, and found the puma waiting for him. "You had a narrow escape that time," said the puma.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1779'>After resting for a few minutes, to let the stag recover from his fright, they went on their way till they came to a grove of bananas.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1780'>"They look very good," observed the puma with a longing glance, "and I am sure you must be hungry, friend stag? Suppose you were to climb the tree and get some. You shall eat the green ones, they are the best and sweetest; and you can throw the yellow ones down to me. I dare say they will do quite well!" The stag did as he was bid, though, not being used to climbing, it gave him a deal of trouble and sore knees, and besides, his horns were continually getting entangled in the creepers. What was worse, when once he had tasted the bananas, he found them not at all to his liking, so he threw them all down, green and yellow alike, and let the puma take his choice. And what a dinner he made! When he had QUITE done, they set forth once more.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1781'>The path lay through a field of maize, where several men were working. As they came up to them, the puma whispered: "Go on in front, friend stag, and just say "Bad luck to all workers!"" The stag obeyed, but the men were hot and tired, and did not think this a good joke. So they set their dogs at him, and he was obliged to run away as fast as he could.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1782'>"I hope your industry will be rewarded as it deserves," said the puma as he passed along; and the men were pleased, and offered him some of their maize to eat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1783'>By-and-by the puma saw a small snake with a beautiful shining skin, lying coiled up at the foot of a tree. "What a lovely bracelet that would make for your daughter, friend stag! said he. The stag stooped and picked up the snake, which bit him, and he turned angrily to the puma. "Why did you not tell me it would bite?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1784'>"Is it my fault if you are an idiot?" replied the puma.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1785'>At last they reached their journey"s end, but by this time it was late, and the puma"s comrade was ready for bed, so they slung their hammocks in convenient places, and went to sleep. But in the middle of the night the puma rose softly and stole out of the door to the sheep-fold, where he killed and ate the fattest sheep he could find, and taking a bowl full of its blood, he sprinkled the sleeping stag with it. This done, he returned to bed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1786'>In the morning the shepherd went as usual to let the sheep out of the fold, and found one of them missing. He thought directly of the puma, and ran to accuse him of having eaten the sheep. "I, my good man? What had put it into your head to think of such a thing? Have I got any blood about me? If anyone has eaten a sheep it must be my friend the stag." Then the shepherd went to examine the sleeping stag, and of course he saw the blood. "Ah! I will teach you how to steal!" cried he, and he hit the stag such a blow on his skull that he died in a moment. The noise awakened the comrade above, and he came downstairs. The puma greeted him with joy, and begged he might have some of the famous milk as soon as possible, for he was very thirsty. A large bucket was set before the puma directly. He drank it to the last drop, and then took leave.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1787'>On his way home he met the monkey. "Are you fond of milk?" asked he. "I know a place where you get it very nice. I will show you it if you like." The monkey knew that the puma was not so good-natured for nothing, but he felt quite able to take care of himself, so he said he should have much pleasure in accompanying his friend.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1788'>They soon reached the same river, and, as before, the puma remarked: "Friend monkey, you will find it very shallow; there is no cause for fear. Jump in and I will follow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1789'>"Do you think you have the stag to deal with?" asked the monkey, laughing. "I should prefer to follow; if not I shall go no further. The puma understood that it was useless trying to make the monkey do as he wished, so he chose a shallow place and began to swim across. The monkey waited till the puma had got to the middle, then he gave a great spring and jumped on his back, knowing quite well that the puma would be afraid to shake him off, lest he should be swept away into deep water. So in this manner they reached <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='manner' adjectives='' verbs='reach' valence='5.88' arousal='3.68666666667' dominance='5.31666666667'>the bank</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1790'>The banana grove was not far distant, and here the puma thought he would pay the monkey out for forcing him to carry him over the river. "Friend monkey, look what fine bananas," cried he. "You are fond of climbing; suppose you run up and throw me down a few. You can eat the green ones, which are the nicest, and I will be content with the yellow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1791'>"Very well," answered the monkey, swinging himself up; but he ate all the yellow ones himself, and only threw down the green ones that were left. The puma was furious and cried out: "I will punch your head for that." But the monkey only answered: "If you are gong to talk such nonsense I won"t walk with you." And the puma was silent.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1792'>In a few minutes more they arrived at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='maize;puma;monkey;worker;man;friend;luck' adjectives='bad' verbs='be;remark;do;wish;please;say;have;go;arrive;reap' valence='5.7645' arousal='4.1595' dominance='5.762'>the field</entity> were the men were reaping the maize, and the puma remarked as he had done before: "Friend monkey, if you wish to please these men, just say as you go by: "Bad luck to all workers."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1793'>"Very well," replied the monkey; but, instead, he nodded and smiled, and said: "I hope your industry may be rewarded as it deserves." The men thanked him heartily, let him pass on, and the puma followed behind him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1794'>Further along the path they saw the shining snake lying on the moss. "What a lovely necklace for your daughter," exclaimed the puma. "Pick it up and take it with you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1795'>"You are very kind, but I will leave it for you," answered the monkey, and nothing more was said about the snake.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1796'>Not long after this they reached the comrade"s house, and found him just ready to go to bed. So, without stopping to talk, the guests slung their hammocks, the monkey taking care to place his so high that no one could get at him. Besides, he thought it would be more prudent not to fall asleep, so he only lay still and snored loudly. When it was quite dark and no sound was to be heard, the puma crept out to the sheep-fold, killed the sheep, and carried back a bowl full of its blood with which to sprinkle the monkey. But the monkey, who had been watching out of the corner of his eye, waited until the puma drew near, and with a violent kick upset the bowl all over the puma himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1797'>When the puma saw what had happened, he turned in a great hurry to leave <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shepherd;hurry;puma' adjectives='great' verbs='do;leave;turn;see;lay;have;happen;come' valence='5.48571428571' arousal='3.99785714286' dominance='5.635'>the house</entity>, but before he could do so, he saw the shepherd coming, and hastily lay down again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1798'>"This is the second time I have lost a sheep," the man said to the monkey; "it will be the worse for the thief when I catch him, I can tell you." The monkey did not answer, but silently pointed to the puma who was pretending to be asleep. The shepherd stooped and saw the blood, and cried out: "Ah! so it is you, is it? then take that!" and with his stick he gave the puma such a blow on the head that he died then and there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1799'>Then the monkey got up and went to the dairy, and drank all the milk he could find. Afterwards he returned home and married, and that is the last we heard of him.</paragraph>

But, industrious as he was, he could hardly buy bread and cheese for himself and his wife, and they grew thinner and thinner daily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1805'>For a long while whey pretended to each other that they had no appetite, and that a few blackberries from the hedges were a great deal nicer than a good strong bowl of soup. But at length there came a day when the cobbler could bear it no longer, and he threw away his last, and borrowing a rod from a neighbour he went out to fish.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1806'>Now the cobbler was as patient about fishing as he had been about cobbling. From dawn to dark he stood on the banks of the little stream, without hooking anything better than an eel, or a few old shoes, that even he, clever though he was, felt were not worth mending. At length his patience began to give way, and as he undressed one night he said to himself: "Well, I will give it one more chance; and if I don"t catch a fish to-morrow, I will go and hang myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1807'>He had not cast his line for ten minutes the next morning before he drew from the river the most beautiful fish he had ever seen in his life.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1809'>The cobbler did not know what to make of these strange words; but he was wiser than many people, and when he did not understand, he thought it was well to obey.

Neither of these things occurred, but, instead, the dragon stopped short with surprise and rage when he saw a monster before him as big and strong as himself. He shook his mane with rage and fury; the enemy in front did exactly the same. He lashed his tail, and rolled his red eyes, and the dragon opposite was no whit behind him. Opening his mouth to its very widest, he gave an awful roar; but the other dragon only roared back. This was too much, and with another roar which made the princess shake in her shoes, he flung himself upon his foe.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1843'>"You must call me the Lady Berberisca," she answered, sharply; "and this is my castle, to which I bid you welcome. You shall live here with me and be my husband." But at these words <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;spear' adjectives='surprised' verbs='be;let' valence='5.465' arousal='4.17166666667' dominance='5.22166666667'>the knight</entity> let his spear fall, so surprised was he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1844'>"I marry YOU? why you must be a hundred at least!" cried he. "You are mad! All I desire is to inspect the castle and then go." As he spoke he heard the voices give a mocking laugh; but the old woman took no notice, and only bade <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='woman;voice;notice;laugh' adjectives='old' verbs='give;bid;hear;take;follow;mock;speak' valence='5.70846153846' arousal='4.31846153846' dominance='5.59'>the knight</entity> follow her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1845'>Old though she was, it seemed impossible to tire her. There was no room, however small, she did not lead him into, and each room was full of curious things he had never seen before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1846'>At length they came to a stone staircase, which was so dark that you could not see your hand if you held it up before your face.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1847'>"I have kept my most precious treasure till the last," said the old woman; "but let me go first, for the stairs are steep, and you might easily break your leg." So on she went, now and then calling back to the young man in the darkness. But he did not know that she had slipped aside into a recess, till suddenly he put his foot on a trap door which gave way under him, and he fell down, down, as many good knights had done before him, and his voice joined the echoes of theirs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1848'>"So you would not marry me!" chuckled the old witch. "Ha! ha! Ha! ha!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1849'>Meanwhile his brother had wandered far and wide, and at last he wandered back to the same great city where the other young knight had met with so many adventures. He noticed, with amazement, that as he walked through the streets the guards drew themselves up in line, and saluted him, and the drummers played the royal march; but he was still more bewildered when several servants in livery ran up to him and told him that the princess was sure something terrible had befallen him, and had made herself ill with weeping. At last it occurred to him that once more he had been taken for his brother. "I had better say nothing," thought he; "perhaps I shall be able to help him after all."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1851'>"And so you did go to the castle?" she asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1852'>"Yes, of course I did," answered he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1853'>"And what did you see there?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1854'>"I am forbidden to tell you anything about it, until I have returned there once more," replied he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1855'>"Must you really go back to that dreadful place?" she asked wistfully. "You are the only man who has ever come back from it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1856'>"I must," was all he answered.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1868'>The knight did as the old witch bade him, and, sure enough, she came out quite whole, but uglier than ever.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='16'>There was once a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called the Simpleton. He was laughed at and despised and neglected on all occasions. Now it happened one day that the eldest son wanted to go into the forest, to hew wood, and his Mother gave him a beautiful cake and a bottle of wine to take with him, so that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst. When he came to the wood he met a little old grey man, who, bidding him good-day, said: "Give me a small piece of the cake in your wallet, and let me drink a mouthful of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty." But the clever son answered: "If I were to give you my cake and wine, I should have none for myself, so be off with you," and he left the little man standing there, and walked away. Hardly had he begun to hew down a tree, when his axe slipped and cut his arm, so that he had to go home at once and have the wound bound up. This was the work of the little grey man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='17'>Thereupon the second son went into the wood, and the Mother gave him, as she had given to the eldest, a sweet cake and a bottle of wine. The little old man met him also, and begged for a small slice of cake and a drink of wine. But the second son spoke out quite plainly. "What I give to you I lose myself--be off with you," and he left the little man standing there, and walked on. Punishment was not long in coming to him, for he had given but two strokes at a tree when he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='18'>Then said the Simpleton: "Father, let me go into the forest and hew wood." But his Father answered him: "Your brothers have done themselves much harm, so as you understand nothing about wood-cutting you had better not try." But the Simpleton begged for so long that at last the Father said: "Well, go if you like; experience will soon make you wiser." To him the Mother gave a cake, but it was made with water and had been baked in the ashes, and with it she gave him a bottle of sour beer. When he came to the wood the little grey man met him also, and greeted him, and said: "Give me a slice of your cake and a drink from your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty." The Simpleton replied: "I have only a cake that has been baked in the ashes, and some sour beer, but if that will satisfy you, let us sit down and eat together." So they sat themselves down, and as the Simpleton held out his food it became a rich cake, and the sour beer became good wine. So they ate and drank together, and when the meal was finished, the little man said: "As you have a good heart and give so willingly a share of your own, I will grant you good luck. Yonder stands an old tree; hew it down, and in its roots you will find something." Saying this the old man took his departure, and off went the Simpleton and cut down the tree. When it fell, there among its roots sat a goose, with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her out, and carried her with him to an inn where he intended to stay the night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='19'>Now the innkeeper had three daughters, who on seeing the goose were curious to know what wonderful kind of a bird it could be, and longed to have one of its golden feathers. The eldest daughter thought to herself, "Surely a chance will come for me to pull out one of those feathers"; and so when the Simpleton had gone out, she caught the goose by the wing. But there her hand stuck fast! Shortly afterwards the second daughter came, as she too was longing for a golden feather. She had hardly touched her sister, however, when she also stuck fast. And lastly came the third daughter with the same object. At this the others cried out, "Keep off, for goodness" sake, keep off!" But she, not understanding why they told her to keep away, thought to herself, "If they go to the goose, why should not I?" She sprang forward, but as she touched her sister she too stuck fast, and pull as she might she could not get away; and thus they had all to pass the night beside the goose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>The next morning the Simpleton took the goose under his arm and went on his way, without troubling himself at all about the three girls who were hanging to the bird. There they went, always running behind him, now to the right, now to the left, whichever way he chose to go. In the middle of the fields they met the parson, and when he saw the procession he called out, "Shame on you, you naughty girls, why do you run after a young fellow in this way? Come, leave go!" With this he caught the youngest by the hand, and tried to pull her back, but when he touched her he found he could not get away, and he too must needs run behind. Then the sexton came along, and saw the parson following on the heels of the three girls. This so astonished him that he called out, "Hi! Sir Parson, whither away so fast? Do you forget that today we have a christening?" and ran after him, and caught him by the coat, but he too remained sticking fast.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'>As the five now ran on, one behind the other, two labourers who were returning from the field with their tools, came along. The parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. No sooner had they touched the sexton, than they too had to hang on, and now there were seven running after the Simpleton and the goose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='22'>In this way they came to a city where a King reigned who had an only daughter, who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. Therefore he had announced that whoever should make her laugh should have her for his wife. When the Simpleton heard this he went with his goose and his train before the Princess, and when she saw the seven people all running behind each other, she began to laugh, and she laughed and laughed till it seemed as though she could never stop. Thereupon the Simpleton demanded her for his wife, but the King was not pleased at the thought of such a son-in-law, and he made all kinds of objections. He told the Simpleton that he must first bring him a man who could drink off a whole cellarful of wine. At once the Simpleton thought of the little grey man, who would be sure to help him, so off he went into the wood, and in the place where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting who looked most miserable. The Simpleton asked him what was the cause of his trouble.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='23'>"I have such a thirst," the man answered, "and I cannot quench it. I cannot bear cold water. I have indeed emptied a cask of wine, but what is a drop like that to a thirsty man?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='24'>"In that case I can help you," said the Simpleton. "Just come with me and you shall be satisfied."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='25'>He led him to the King"s cellar, and the man at once sat down in front of the great cask, and drank and drank till before a day was over he had drunk the whole cellarful of wine. Then the Simpleton demanded his bride again, but the King was angry that a mean fellow everyone called a Simpleton should win his daughter, and he made new conditions. Before giving him his daughter to wife he said that the Simpleton must find a man who would eat a whole mountain of bread. The Simpleton did not stop long to consider, but went off straight to the wood. There in the same place as before sat a man who was buckling a strap tightly around him, and looking very depressed. He said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='26'>"I have eaten a whole ovenful of loaves, but what help is that when a man is as hungry as I am? I feel quite empty, and I must strap myself together if I am not to die of hunger."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='27'>The Simpleton was delighted on hearing this, and said: "Get up at once and come with me. I will give you enough to eat to satisfy your hunger."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='28'>He led him to the King, who meanwhile had ordered all the meal in the Kingdom to be brought together, and an immense mountain of bread baked from it. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mountain' adjectives='whole' verbs='work;set;disappear;have' valence='5.644' arousal='3.705' dominance='5.845'>The man</entity> from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mountain' adjectives='whole' verbs='work;set;disappear;have' valence='5.644' arousal='3.705' dominance='5.845'>the wood</entity> set to work on it, and in one day the whole mountain had disappeared.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='30'>"If you are really able to sail such a ship," said he, "you shall at once have my daughter for your wife."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='31'>The Simpleton went into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cake;man' adjectives='little;old;grey' verbs='go;give;have;sit' valence='5.818' arousal='4.119' dominance='5.403'>the wood</entity>, and there sat the little old grey man to whom he had given his cake.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='32'>"I have drunk for you, and I have eaten for you," said the little man, "and I will also give you the ship; all this I do for you because you were kind to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='33'>Then he gave the Simpleton a ship that went both on land and water, and when the King saw it he knew he could no longer keep back his daughter.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='36'>THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='37'>Once upon a time there were Three Bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little, Small, Wee Bear; and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great, Huge Bear. They had each a pot for their porridge; a little pot for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the Middle Bear, and a great pot for the Great, Huge Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle Bear, and a great chair for the Great, Huge Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear, and a great bed for the Great, Huge Bear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='38'>One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon to eat it. And while they were walking, a little Girl called Goldenlocks came to the house. First she looked in at the window, and then she peeped in at the keyhole; and seeing nobody in the house, she turned the handle of the door. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldenlocks opened the door, and went in; and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a thoughtful little Girl, she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But the porridge looked tempting, and she set about helping herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='39'>So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was too hot for her. And then she tasted the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that; and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='40'>Then Goldenlocks sat down in the chair of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was too hard for her. And then she sat down in the chair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her. And then she sat down in the chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sat till the bottom of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ground;bottom' adjectives='plump' verbs='sit;come;seat' valence='5.25625' arousal='3.27' dominance='5.42875'>the chair</entity> came out, and down she came plump upon the ground.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='41'>Then Goldenlocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great, Huge Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='42'>By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough; so they came home to breakfast. Now <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='standing;porridge;spoon;great;bear' adjectives='huge' verbs='leave;have' valence='5.71285714286' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.14571428571'>Goldenlocks</entity> had left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear standing in his porridge.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!" said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice. And when the Middle Bear looked at hers, she saw that the spoon was standing in it too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='44'>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!" said the Middle Bear, in her middle voice. Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was all gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!" said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='46'>Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that someone had entered their house, and eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear"s breakfast, began to look about them. Now <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='great;bear;cushion' adjectives='huge;hard' verbs='put;rise;have' valence='5.86111111111' arousal='3.68666666667' dominance='5.52111111111'>Goldenlocks</entity> had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='great;bear;cushion' adjectives='huge;hard' verbs='put;rise;have' valence='5.86111111111' arousal='3.68666666667' dominance='5.52111111111'>the chair</entity> of the Great, Huge Bear.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='48'>And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='middle;bear;cushion' adjectives='soft' verbs='squat;have' valence='5.68166666667' arousal='3.45333333333' dominance='5.51833333333'>Goldenlocks</entity> had squatted down the soft cushion of the Middle Bear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!" said the Middle Bear, in her middle voice.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SAT THE BOTTOM OUT OF IT!" said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='52'>Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should make farther search; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='great;place;pillow' adjectives='' verbs='pull;have' valence='6.12285714286' arousal='3.84571428571' dominance='5.67428571429'>Goldenlocks</entity> had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear out of its place.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!" said the Middle Bear, in her middle voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place; and the pillow in its place upon the bolster; and upon the pillow was the head of Goldenlocks--which was not in its place, for she had no business there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED--AND HERE SHE IS!" said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>Goldenlocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great, Huge Bear, and the middle voice of the Middle Bear, but it was only as if she had heard someone speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started; and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. Out Goldenlocks jumped, and ran away as fast as she could run--never looking behind her; and what happened to her afterwards I cannot tell. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.</paragraph>

Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;hill;fair;pig' adjectives='round' verbs='do;begin;hide;get;frighten;turn;go;run;churn;roll' valence='5.69176470588' arousal='3.91941176471' dominance='5.35823529412'>Wolf</entity> so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>TOM THUMB</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='90'>Long ago, in the merry days of good King Arthur, there lived a ploughman and his wife. They were very poor, but would have been contented and happy if only they could have had a little child. One day, having heard of the great fame of the magician Merlin, who was living at the Court of King Arthur, the wife persuaded her husband to go and tell him of their trouble. Having arrived at the Court, the man besought Merlin with tears in his eyes to give them a child, saying that they would be quite content even though it should be no bigger than his thumb. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thumb;wife;father;request;son;s;astonishment;countryman;home' adjectives='wonderful;bigger' verbs='be;determine;grant;relate;reach;s;have;find' valence='6.13823529412' arousal='4.09' dominance='5.75764705882'>Merlin</entity> determined to grant the request, and what was the countryman"s astonishment to find when he reached home that his wife had a son, who, wonderful to relate, was no bigger than his father"s thumb!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='91'>The parents were now very happy, and the christening of the little fellow took place with great ceremony. The Fairy Queen, attended by all her company of elves, was present at the feast. She kissed the little child, and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, told her fairies to fetch the tailors of her Court, who dressed her little godson according to her orders. His hat was made of a beautiful oak leaf, his shirt of a fine spider"s web, and his hose and doublet were of thistledown, his stockings were made with the rind of a delicate green apple, and the garters were two of the finest little hairs imaginable, plucked from his mother"s eyebrows, while his shoes were made of the skin of a little mouse. When he was thus dressed, the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fairy;court;luck' adjectives='good' verbs='fly;be;dress;kiss;wish' valence='6.51454545455' arousal='4.57090909091' dominance='5.96818181818'>Fairy Queen</entity> kissed him once more, and, wishing him all good luck, flew off with the fairies to her Court.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>As Tom grew older, he became very amusing and full of tricks, so that his mother was afraid to let him out of her sight. One day, while she was making a batter pudding, Tom stood on the edge of the bowl, with a lighted candle in his hand, so that she might see that the pudding was made properly. Unfortunately, however, when her back was turned, Tom fell into the bowl, and his mother, not missing him, stirred him up in the pudding, tied it in a cloth, and put it into the pot. The batter filled Tom"s mouth, and prevented him from calling out, but he had no sooner felt the hot water, than he kicked and struggled so much that the pudding jumped about in the pot, and his mother, thinking the pudding was bewitched, was nearly frightened out of her wits. Pulling it out of the pot, she ran with it to her door, and gave it to a tinker who was passing. He was very thankful for it, and looked forward to having a better dinner than he had enjoyed for many a long day. But his pleasure did not last long, for, as he was getting over a stile, he happened to sneeze very hard, and Tom, who had been quite quiet inside the pudding for some time, called out at the top of his little voice, "Hallo, Pickens!" This so terrified the tinker that he flung away the pudding, and ran off as fast as he could. The pudding was all broken to pieces by the fall, and Tom crept out, covered with batter, and ran home to his mother, who had been looking everywhere for him, and was delighted to see him again. She gave him a bath in a cup, which soon washed off all the pudding, and he was none the worse for his adventure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>A few days after this, Tom accompanied his mother when she went into the fields to milk the cows, and, fearing he might be blown away by the wind, she tied him to a sow-thistle with a little piece of thread. While she was milking, a cow came by, bit off the thistle, and swallowed up Tom. Poor Tom did not like her big teeth, and called out loudly, "Mother, mother!" "But where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" cried out his mother, wringing her hands. "Here, mother," he shouted, "inside the red cow"s mouth!" And, saying that, he began to kick and scratch till the poor cow was nearly mad, and at length tumbled him out of her mouth. On seeing this, his mother rushed to him, caught him in her arms, and carried him safely home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='94'>Some days after this, his father took him to the fields a-ploughing, and gave him a whip, made of a barley straw, with which to drive the oxen; but little Tom was soon lost in a furrow. An eagle seeing him, picked him up and flew with him to the top of a hill where stood a giant"s castle. The giant put him at once into his mouth, intending to swallow him up, but Tom made such a great disturbance when he got inside that the monster was soon glad to get rid of him, and threw him far away into the sea. But he was not drowned, for he had scarcely touched the water before he was swallowed by a large fish, which was shortly afterwards captured and brought to King Arthur, as a present, by the fisherman. When the fish was opened, everyone was astonished at finding Tom inside. He was at once carried to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='court;dwarf' adjectives='' verbs='carry;be;make' valence='5.36166666667' arousal='3.81333333333' dominance='4.995'>the King</entity>, who made him his Court dwarf.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='107'>Shortly after his return, he one day displeased the King, so, fearing the royal anger, he crept into an empty flower-pot, where he lay for a long time.

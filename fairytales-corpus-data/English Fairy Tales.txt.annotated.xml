One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge; a little bowl for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bowl for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bowl for the Great Big Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in; a little chair for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great chair for the Great Big Bear.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.</paragraph>

Look you here, I have been searching for a maiden to wife, and your daughter who can spin five skeins a day is the very one for me. Only, mind you, though for eleven months of the year she shall be Queen indeed, and have all she likes to eat, all the gowns she likes to get, all the company she likes to keep, and everything her heart desires, in the twelfth month she must set to work and spin five skeins a day, and if she does not she must die. Come! is it a bargain?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='384'>So the mother agreed. She thought what a grand marriage it was for her daughter. And as for the five skeins?

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='385'>Anyhow, her daughter would be Queen for eleven months. So they were married, and for eleven months the bride was happy as happy could be. She had everything she liked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get, all the company she cared to keep, and everything her heart desired. And her husband the King was kind as kind could be. But in the tenth month she began to think of those five skeins and wonder if the King remembered. And in the eleventh month she began to dream about them as well. But ne"er a word did <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;ne;husband' adjectives='' verbs='do;forget;say;have;hope;er' valence='5.84111111111' arousal='4.35222222222' dominance='5.74444444444'>the King</entity>, her husband, say about them; so she hoped he had forgotten.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>But on the very last day of the eleventh month, the King, her husband, led her into a room she had never set eyes on before. It had one window, and there was nothing in it but a stool and a spinning-wheel.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>"Now, my dear," he said quite kind like, "you will be shut in here to-morrow morning with some victuals and some flax, and if by evening you have not spun five skeins, your head will come off."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='388'>Well she was fair frightened, for she had always been such a gatless thoughtless girl that she had never learnt to spin at all. So what she was to do on the morrow she could not tell; for, see you, she had no one to help her; for, of course, now she was Queen, her mother didn"t live nigh her. So she just locked <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='eye;stool;room' adjectives='red;pretty' verbs='lock;be;cry;sit' valence='5.12384615385' arousal='4.10384615385' dominance='4.86153846154'>the door</entity> of her room, sat down on a stool, and cried and cried and cried until her pretty eyes were all red.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='389'>Now as she sate sobbing and crying she heard a queer little noise at the bottom of the door. At first she thought it was a mouse. Then she thought it must be something knocking.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='390'>So she upped and opened the door and what did she see? Why! a small, little, black Thing with a long tail that whisked round and round ever so fast.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='392'>"What"s that to you?" said she, shrinking a bit, for that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bit' adjectives='queer' verbs='be;say;shrink' valence='5.48375' arousal='3.99' dominance='5.3425'>Thing</entity> was very queer like.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='394'>And sure enough That had on buckled shoes with high heels and big bows, ever so smart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='395'>[Illustration: A small, little, black Thing with a long tail]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='396'>So she kind of forgot about the tail, and wasn"t so frightened, and when That asked her again why she was crying, she upped and said, "It won"t do no good if I do."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>"Well," says she, "it can"t do any harm if it doesn"t do good." So she dried her pretty eyes and told That all about the pies, and the skeins, and everything from first to last.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='399'>And then that little, black Thing nearly burst with laughing. "If that is all, it"s easy mended!" it says. "I"ll come to your window every morning, take the flax, and bring it back spun into five skeins at night. Come! shall it be a bargain?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='400'>Now she, for all she was so gatless and thoughtless, said, cautious like:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='401'>"But what is your pay?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='402'>Then That twirled its tail so fast you couldn"t see it, and stuck out its beautiful toes, and smirked and looked out of the corners of its eyes. "I will give you three guesses every night to guess my name, and if you haven"t guessed it before the month is up, why"--and That twirled its tail faster and stuck out its toes further, and smirked and sniggered more than ever--"you shall be mine, my beauty."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='403'>Three guesses every night for a whole month! She felt sure she would be able for so much; and there was no other way out of the business, so she just said, "Yes! I agree!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='404'>And lor! how That twirled its tail, and bowed, and smirked, and stuck out its beautiful toes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='405'>Well, the very next day her husband led her to the strange room again, and there was the day"s food, and a spinning-wheel and a great bundle of flax.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='406'>"There you are, my dear," says he as polite as polite. "And remember! if there are not five whole skeins to-night, I fear your head will come off!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='407'>At that she began to tremble, and after he had gone away and locked the door, she was just thinking of a good cry, when she heard a queer knocking at the window. She upped at once and opened it, and sure enough there was the small, little, black Thing sitting on the window-ledge, dangling its beautiful toes and twirling its tail so that you could scarcely see it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='408'>"Good-morning, my beauty," says That. "Come! hand over the flax, sharp, there"s a good girl."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='409'>So she gave That the flax and shut the window and, you may be sure, ate her victuals, for, as you know, she had a good appetite, and the King, her husband, had promised to give her everything she liked to eat.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='420'>"I shall not have to order your head off, my dear," says he. "And I hope all the other days will pass as happily."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>So it came to the last day of the month but one, and when the small, little, black Thing arrived in the evening with the five skeins of flax all ready spun, it could hardly say for smirking:</paragraph>

Then he bade the servants bring supper, and a stool for him to sit beside his <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='servant;stool;side;supper' adjectives='lover-like' verbs='bring;bid;sit' valence='5.43909090909' arousal='3.70545454545' dominance='5.61272727273'>Queen</entity>, and down they sat, lover-like, side by side.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>"At something I saw to-day, my love," says the King. "I was out a-hunting, and by chance I came to a place I"d never been in before. It was in a wood, and there was an old chalk-pit there, and out of the chalk-pit there came a queer kind of a sort of a humming, humming noise. So I got off my hobby to see what made it, and went quite quiet to the edge of the pit and looked down. And what do you think I saw? The funniest, queerest, smallest, little, black Thing you ever set eyes upon. And it had a little spinning-wheel and it was spinning away for dear life, but the wheel didn"t go so fast as its tail, and that span round and round--_ho-ho-ha-ha!_--you never saw the like. And its little feet had buckled shoes and bows on them, and they went up and down in a desperate hurry. And all the time that small, little, black Thing kept bumming and booming away at these words:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='441'>And she said no word when next morning the small, little, black Thing came for the flax, though it looked so gleeful and maliceful that she could hardly help laughing, knowing she had got the better of it.

But that Thing was as bold as brass and came right inside, grinning from ear to ear. And oh, my goodness! how That"s tail was twirling and whisking!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='442'>"Well, my beauty," says That, giving her the five skeins all ready spun, "what"s my name?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='444'>"No, it ain"t," laughs That, smirking out of the corner of That"s eye.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>Once upon a time, and a very good time too, though it was not in my time, nor your time, nor for the matter of that in any one"s time, there lived a man and a woman who had one son called Jack, and he was just terribly fond of reading books. He read, and he read, and then, because his parents lived in a lonely house in a lonely forest and he never saw any other folk but his father and his mother, he became quite crazy to go out into the world and see charming princesses and the like.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='461'>So one day he told his mother he must be off, and she called him an air-brained addle-pate, but added that, as he was no use at home, he had better go seek his fortune. Then she asked him if he would rather take a small cake with her blessing to eat on his journey, or a large cake with her curse? Now <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lad' adjectives='hungry' verbs='be;say' valence='5.364' arousal='4.412' dominance='5.394'>Jack</entity> was a very hungry lad, so he just up and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='462'>"A big cake, if you please, "m."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>So his mother made a great big cake, and when he started she just off to the top of the house and cast malisons on him, till he got out of sight. You see she had to do it, but after that she sate down and cried.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='464'>Well, Jack hadn"t gone far till he came to a field where his father was ploughing. Now the goodman was dreadfully put out when he found his son was going away, and still more so when he heard he had chosen his mother"s malison. So he cast about what to do to put things straight, and at last he drew out of his pocket a little golden snuff-box, and gave it to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pocket;thing;snuff-box' adjectives='golden;little;last' verbs='do;draw;give;cast;say;put' valence='5.97416666667' arousal='4.055' dominance='5.745'>the lad</entity>, saying:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='467'>Now, after a time, he grew very tired, and very hungry, for he had eaten his big cake first thing, and night closed in on him so that he could scarce see his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='468'>But at last he came to a large house and begged board and lodging at the back door. Now Jack was a good-looking young fellow, so the maid-servant at once called him in to the fireside and gave him plenty good meat and bread and beer. And it so happened that while he was eating his supper the master"s gay young daughter came into the kitchen and saw him. So she went to her father and said that there was the prettiest young fellow she had ever seen in the back kitchen, and that if her father loved her he would give the young man some employment. Now the gentleman of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='daughter;gentleman;kitchen' adjectives='fond;young;gay;back' verbs='be;do;question;vex;want;go' valence='6.23142857143' arousal='3.94214285714' dominance='5.73142857143'>the house</entity> was exceedingly fond of his gay young daughter, and did not want to vex her; so he went into the back kitchen and questioned <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;gentleman;kitchen' adjectives='fond;young;gay;back' verbs='be;do;question;vex;want;go' valence='6.23142857143' arousal='3.94214285714' dominance='5.73142857143'>Jack</entity> as to what he could do.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='470'>But the gentleman saw a way of pleasing his gay young daughter and getting rid of the trouble of employing Jack; so he laughs and says, "If you can do anything, my good lad," says he, "you had better do this. By eight o"clock to-morrow morning you must have dug a lake four miles round in front of my mansion, and on it there must be floating a whole fleet of vessels. And they must range up in front of my mansion and fire a salute of guns.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='475'>Well! Jack sate on the side of his bed and tried to think things out, but he felt as if he didn"t know _b_ from a battledore, so he decided to think no more, and after saying his prayers he lay down and went to sleep. And he did sleep! When he woke it was close on eight o"clock, and he had only time to fly to the window and look out, when the great clock on the tower began to whirr before it struck the hour. And there was the lawn in front of the house all set with beds of roses and stocks and marigolds! Well! all of a sudden he remembered the little golden snuff-box.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='483'>"Give us a little more time when you want us next, Master," they said sulkily.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='486'>Then he said to Jack, "My daughter must have a fine house to live in. Therefore by to-morrow morning at eight o"clock there must be a magnificent castle standing on twelve golden pillars in the middle of the lake, and there must be a church beside it. And all things must be ready for the bride, and at eight o"clock precisely a peal of bells from the church must ring out for the wedding. If not you will have to forfeit your life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='487'>This time Jack intended to give the three little red men more time for their task; but what with having enjoyed himself so much all day, and having eaten so much good food, he overslept himself, so that the big clock on the tower was whirring before it struck eight when he woke, leapt out of bed, and rushed to the golden snuff-box. But he had forgotten where he had put it, and so the clock had _really_ begun to strike before he found it under his pillow, opened it, and gabbled out his orders. And then you never saw how the three little red men tumbled over each other and yawned and stretched and made haste all at one time, so that Jack thought his life would surely be forfeit. But just as the clock struck its last chime, out rang a peal of merry bells, and there was the Castle standing on twelve golden pillars and a church beside it in the middle of the lake. And the Castle was all decorated for the wedding, and there were crowds and crowds of servants and retainers, all dressed in their Sunday best.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='488'>Never had Jack seen such a sight before; neither had the gay young daughter who, of course, was looking out of the next window in her nightcap. And she looked so pretty and so gay that Jack felt quite cross when he had to step back to let the three little red men fly to their golden snuff-box. But they were far crosser than he was, and mumbled and grumbled at the hustle, so that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='box;hustle' adjectives='crosser;glad' verbs='be;shut;snore;grumble;begin;mumble' valence='5.428' arousal='3.621' dominance='5.198'>Jack</entity> was quite glad when they shut the box down and began to snore.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='491'>Thus it happened that one day when he was going a-hunting with all the ladies and gentlemen, Jack forgot to change the golden snuff-box (which he always carried about with him for fear of accidents) from his waistcoat pocket to that of his scarlet hunting-coat; so he left it behind him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='492'>Well! when they found out that they hadn"t really been summoned, and that there was no fear of death, they were in a towering temper and said they had a great mind to fly away with the Castle, golden pillars and all.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='497'>Now the little red men need not really have obeyed the order, but they were so cross with Jack that hardly had the servant said the words before the task was done; so when the hunting-party came back, lo and behold! the Castle, and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='castle;pillar' adjectives='golden' verbs='disappear;have' valence='5.81' arousal='4.12833333333' dominance='5.515'>the church</entity>, and the golden pillars had all disappeared!</paragraph>

Now at last he came to the palace of the King of all the Mice in the Wide World. And there was a little mousie in a fine hauberk and a steel cap doing sentry at the front gate, and he was not for letting Jack in until he had told his errand.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='501'>Now the King of the Mice received Jack very graciously, and said that he himself knew nothing of the missing Castle, but, as he was King of all the Mice in the whole world, it was possible that some of his subjects might know more than he.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='505'>So Jack set off on the King"s horse, and as he passed the outer gate he saw the little mouse sentry coming away, for its guard was up.

So he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the crumbs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='506'>"Here you are, mousekin," he said. "That"s for your trouble!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='509'>But the mousekin insisted. "I may be of some use to you," it said. So it ran up the horse"s hind leg and up by its tail and hid in Jack"s pocket. And the horse set off at a hard gallop, for it didn"t half like the mouse running over it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='510'>So at last Jack came to the palace of the King of all the Frogs, and there at the front gate was a frog doing sentry in a fine coat of mail and a brass helmet.

So they were taken to the King"s chamber, where he sate surrounded by frog courtiers in fine clothes; but alas! he had heard nothing of the Castle on golden pillars, and though he summoned all the frogs of all the world to a Grand Assembly next morning, they all answered his question with:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='514'>So Jack set off, and being a kind-hearted lad he gave the frog sentry, whom he met coming away from his guard, some crumbs he had saved from his dinner.

	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='546'>So before the clock struck eight next morning, there was the Castle on its twelve golden pillars, and the King of the Birds was fine and pleased, and let Jack take his horse and ride to the palace of the King of the Frogs.

At this the little red men were a wee bit cross; but they said they supposed it could not be helped; so, though they yawned, they brought the Castle all right, and Jack was allowed to take his horse and go to the palace of the King of all the Mice in the World.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='634'>But his wife would not hear of the laundry-maid being blamed; she was the best servant in the house, and worth all the rest of them put together; it was his men who were at fault.

It was boiling and gave out a savoury steam; while beside it, on the right hand, stood a big massive table set out with huge platters and mugs. Here it was that the giants used to dine. Going a little further he came upon a sort of window barred with iron, and looking within beheld a vast number of miserable captives.</paragraph>

There they live pitiably in confinement; but most of all do I grieve for a duke"s daughter whom they kidnapped in her father"s garden, bringing her hither in a burning chariot drawn by fiery dragons. Her form is that of a white hind; and though many valiant knights have tried their utmost to break the spell and work her deliverance, none have succeeded; for, see you, at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='none;form;knight;spell;griffin;deliverance;hind' adjectives='many;white;utmost;valiant;dreadful' verbs='be;attempt;work;try;see;succeed;have;pass;break;destroy' valence='5.66' arousal='4.0784' dominance='5.5036'>the entrance</entity> to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='none;form;knight;spell;griffin;deliverance;hind' adjectives='many;white;utmost;valiant;dreadful' verbs='be;attempt;work;try;see;succeed;have;pass;break;destroy' valence='5.66' arousal='4.0784' dominance='5.5036'>the castle</entity> are two dreadful griffins who destroy every one who attempts to pass them by."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='793'>Now Jack bethought him of the coat of darkness which had served him so well before, and he put on the cap of knowledge, and in an instant he knew what had to be done.

The enchantments being thus broken, all the valiant knights and beautiful ladies, who had been transformed into birds and beasts and fishes and reptiles and insects, returned to their proper shapes, including the duke"s daughter, who, from being a white hind, showed as the most beauteous maiden upon whom the sun ever shone.

Well, they gave her a coat of silver cloth, but she wouldn"t take him for all that, but went again to the hen-wife, who said, "Say you will not take him unless they give you a coat of beaten gold." Well, they gave her a coat of beaten gold, but still she would not take the old man, but went again to the hen-wife, who said, "Say you will not take him unless they give you a coat made of the feathers of all the birds of the air." So they sent out a man with a great heap of peas; and the man cried to all the birds of the air, "Each bird take a pea and put down a feather." So each bird took a pea and put down one of its feathers: and they took all the feathers and made a coat of them and gave it to her; but still she would not take the nasty, horrid old man, but asked the hen-wife once again what she was to do, and the hen-wife said, "Say they must first make you a coat of catskin."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1321'>Now when the day of the ball arrived, Catskin slipped out of the house and went to the edge of the forest where she had hidden her dresses.

And, lo and behold! while he was away the Queen at long last bore him a little son. As you may imagine, she was fair delighted, and thought how pleased the King would be when he came home and found that his dearest wish had been fulfilled. And all the courtiers were fine and pleased too, and set about at once to arrange a grand festival for the naming of the little Prince. But the Queen said, "No! The child shall have no name till his father gives it to him. Till then we will call him "Nix! Naught! Nothing!" because his father knows nothing about him!"</paragraph>

The giant grew weary of his burden, and sate down on the big stone to rest. So he fell a-dozing, woke with a start, and called out:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1448'>Then the giant laughed with glee and rubbed his hands saying, "I"ve got the right one at last." So he took Nix Naught Nothing to his own house under the whirlpools; for the giant was really a great Magician who could take any form he chose. And the reason he wanted a little prince so badly was that he had lost his wife, and had only one little daughter who needed a playmate sorely. So Nix Naught Nothing and the Magician"s daughter grew up together, and every year made them fonder and fonder of each other, until she promised to marry him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1449'>Now the Magician had no notion that his daughter should marry just an ordinary human prince, the like of whom he had eaten a thousand times, so he sought some way in which he could quietly get rid of Nix Naught Nothing. So he said one day, "I have work for you, Nix Naught Nothing! There is a stable hard by which is seven miles long, and seven miles broad, and it has not been cleaned for seven years. By to-morrow evening you must have cleaned it, or I will have you for my supper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1450'>Well, before dawn, Nix Naught Nothing set to work at his task; but, as fast as he cleared the muck, it just fell back again. So by breakfast-time he was in a terrible sweat; yet not one whit nearer the end of his job was he. Now the Magician"s daughter, coming to bring him his breakfast, found him so distraught and distracted that he could scarce speak to her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1451'>"We"ll soon set that to rights," she said. So she just clapped her hands and called:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1454'>And, lo and behold! in a minute the beasts of the fields came trooping, and the sky was just dark with the wings of birds, and they carried away the muck, and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='muck;pin;sky;bird;beast;field;wing' adjectives='dark;new;clean' verbs='carry;be;come' valence='5.79526315789' arousal='3.92157894737' dominance='5.32631578947'>the stable</entity> was clean as a new pin before the evening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1455'>Now when the Magician saw this, he grew hot and angry, and he guessed it was his daughter"s magic that had wrought the miracle. So he said: "Shame on the wit that helped you; but I have a harder job for you to-morrow. Yonder is a lake seven miles long, seven miles broad, and seven miles deep. Drain it by nightfall, so that not one drop remains, or, of a certainty, I eat you for supper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1456'>So once again Nix Naught Nothing rose before dawn, and began his task; but though he baled out the water without ceasing, it ever ran back, so that though he sweated and laboured, by breakfast-time he was no nearer the end of his job.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1457'>But when the Magician"s daughter came with his breakfast she only laughed and said, "I"ll soon mend that!" Then she clapped her hands and called:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1459'>Drink me this water for love of me!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1460'>And, lo and behold! the lake was thick with fishes. And they drank and drank, till not one drop remained.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1461'>Now when the Magician returned in the morning and saw this he was as angry as angry. And he knew it was his daughter"s magic, so he said: "Double shame on the wit that helped you! Yet it betters you not, for I will give you a yet harder task than the last. If you do that, you may have my daughter. See you, yonder is a tree, seven miles high, and no branch to it till the top, and there on the fork is a nest with some eggs in it. Bring those eggs down without breaking one or, sure as fate, I"ll eat you for my supper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1462'>Then the Magician"s daughter was very sad; for with all her magic she could think of no way of helping her lover to fetch the eggs and bring them down unbroken. So she sate with Nix Naught Nothing underneath <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='idea;hand' adjectives='' verbs='cry;come;sate;clap;think' valence='5.88454545455' arousal='4.25909090909' dominance='5.42272727273'>the tree</entity>, and thought, and thought, and thought; until an idea came to her, and she clapped her hands and cried:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1465'>Then her fingers dropped off her hands one by one and ranged themselves like <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ladder;top;finger;hand' adjectives='enough' verbs='be;range;drop;reach;cry' valence='5.64666666667' arousal='3.85066666667' dominance='5.42466666667'>the steps</entity> of a ladder up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ladder;top;finger;hand' adjectives='enough' verbs='be;range;drop;reach;cry' valence='5.64666666667' arousal='3.85066666667' dominance='5.42466666667'>the tree</entity>; but they were not quite enough of them to reach the top, so she cried again:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1466'>"Oh! toes of mine, for love o" me,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1468'>Then her toes began to drop off one by one and range themselves like the rungs of a ladder; but when the toes of one foot had gone to their places the ladder was tall enough. So Nix Naught Nothing climbed up it, reached the nest, and got the seven eggs. Now, as he was coming down with the last, he was so overjoyed at having finished his task, that he turned to see if the Magician"s daughter was overjoyed too: and lo! the seventh egg slipped from his hand and fell</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1469'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1470'>Crash!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1471'>"Quick! Quick!" cried the Magician"s daughter, who, as you will observe, always had her wits about her. "There is nothing for it now but to fly at once. But first I must have my magic flask, or I shall be unable to help. It is in my room and the door is locked. Put your fingers, since I have none, in my pocket, take the key, unlock the door, get the flask, and follow me fast. I shall go slower than you, for I have no toes on one foot!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1472'>So Nix Naught Nothing did as he was bid, and soon caught up the Magician"s daughter. But alas! they could not run very fast, so ere long the Magician, who had once again taken a giant"s form in order to have a long stride, could be seen behind them. Nearer and nearer he came until he was just going to seize Nix Naught Nothing, when the Magician"s daughter cried: "Put your fingers, since I have none, into my hair, take my comb and throw it down." So Nix Naught Nothing did as he was bid, and, lo and behold! out of every one of the comb-prongs there sprang up a prickly briar, which grew so fast that the Magician found himself in the middle of a thorn hedge! You may guess how angry and scratched he was before he tore his way out. So Nix Naught Nothing and his sweetheart had time for a good start; but the Magician"s daughter could not run fast because she had lost her toes on one foot! Therefore the Magician in giant form soon caught them up, and he was just about to grip Nix Naught Nothing when the Magician"s daughter cried: "Put your fingers, since I have none, to my breast. Take out my veil-dagger and throw it down."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1473'>So he did as he was bid, and in a moment the dagger had grown to thousands and thousands of sharp razors, criss-cross on the ground, and the Magician giant was howling with pain as he trod among them. You may guess how he danced and stumbled and how long it took for him to pick his way through as if he were walking on eggs!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1474'>So Nix Naught Nothing and his sweetheart were nearly out of sight ere the giant could start again; yet it wasn"t long before he was like to catch them up; for the Magician"s daughter, you see, could not run fast because she had lost her toes on one foot! She did what she could, but it was no use. So just as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;naught;nix;hold;hand' adjectives='' verbs='be;cry;reach;lay' valence='5.30222222222' arousal='4.30666666667' dominance='5.24777777778'>the giant</entity> was reaching out a hand to lay hold of Nix Naught Nothing she cried breathlessly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1475'>"There"s nothing left but the magic flask. Take it out and sprinkle some of what it holds on the ground."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1476'>And Nix Naught Nothing did as he was bid; but in his hurry he nearly emptied the flask altogether; and so the big, big wave of water which instantly welled up, swept him off his feet, and would have carried him away, had not the Magician"s daughter"s loosened veil caught him and held him fast. But the wave grew, and grew, and grew behind them, until it reached <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shoulder;sort;head;waist;sea-snail;fish;wave;s;crab;creature' adjectives='great;full;big;little;strange;sea-wave' verbs='reach;grow;sweep' valence='5.8744' arousal='3.6548' dominance='5.5392'>the giant</entity>"s waist; then it grew and grew until it reached his shoulders; and it grew and grew until it swept over his head: a great big sea-wave full of little fishes and crabs and sea-snails and all sorts of strange creatures.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1477'>So that was the last of the Magician giant. But the poor little Magician"s daughter was so weary that, after a time she couldn"t move a step further, and she said to her lover, "Yonder are lights burning.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1479'>"Who are you?" asked the hen-wife suspiciously.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1480'>"I am Nix Naught Nothing," replied the young man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1481'>Now the hen-wife still grieved over her boy who had been killed, so she instantly resolved to be revenged.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1482'>"I cannot give you a night"s lodging," she said, "but you shall have a drink of milk, for you look weary.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1483'>So she gave him a cup of milk; but, being a witch-woman, she put a potion to it so that the very moment he saw his father and mother he should fall fast asleep, and none should be able to waken him so he would be no use to anybody, and would not recognize his father and mother.</paragraph>

Now one day she lost her temper with a cobweb and swept so hard after it that bang! bang! the broom-handle went right through the glass, and crash! crash! clitter! clatter! there was the pickle-jar house about her ears all in splinters and bits.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1584'>So the years passed, and when Tom was a lad, still no bigger than a thumb, his father thought he might begin to make himself useful. So he made him a whip out of a barley straw, and set him to drive the cattle home. But Tom, in trying to climb a furrow"s ridge--which to him, of course, was a steep hill--slipped down and lay half stunned, so that a raven, happening to fly over, thought he was a frog, and picked him up intending to eat him.

However, he recovered in some measure, but had grown so thin and light that to save him the trouble of walking back to the Court, his mother tied him to a dandelion-clock, and as there was a high wind, away he went as if on wings.

At the end of a week, however, King Arthur, having recovered the loss of the furmenty, sent for Tom and once more received him into favour. After this Tom"s life was happy and successful. He became so renowned for his dexterity and wonderful activity, that he was knighted, by the King under the name of Sir Thomas Thumb, and as his clothes, what with the batter and the furmenty, to say nothing of the insides of giants and fishes, had become somewhat shabby, His Majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes fit for a mounted knight to wear.

For two or three days he lived in the streets in this way, only just able to keep himself alive, when he managed to get some work to do in a hayfield, and that kept him for a short time longer, till the haymaking was over.</paragraph>

However, just then Mr. Fitzwarren himself came home to dinner, and when he saw what was happening, he asked Dick why he was lying there. "You"re old enough to be at work, my boy," he said.

One day when he had earned a penny for cleaning a gentleman"s shoes, he met a little girl with a cat in her arms, and asked whether she would not sell it to him. "Yes, she would," she said, though the cat was such a good mouser that she was sorry to part with her. This just suited Dick, who kept pussy up in his garret, feeding her on scraps of his own dinner that he saved for her every day. In a little while he had no more bother with the rats and mice.

There she sate down and plaited herself an overall of rushes and a cap to match, so as to hide her fine clothes, and her beautiful golden hair that was all set with milk-white pearls. For she was a wise girl, and thought that in such lonely country, mayhap, some robber might fall in with her and kill her to get her fine clothes and jewels.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2171'>It took a long time to plait the dress and cap, and while she plaited she sang a little song:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2186'>By this time she was very, very hungry, so she wandered on, and she wandered on; but ne"er a cottage or a hamlet did she see, till just at sun-setting she came on a great house on the edge of the fen.

So, being a clever girl, she guessed what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='girl' adjectives='clever' verbs='be;guess;say;want' valence='6.03777777778' arousal='4.34555555556' dominance='5.73666666667'>the maid</entity> was wanting, and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2189'>Now next morning the pots were scraped so clean that they looked like new, and the saucepans were polished like silver, and the cook said to the scullion, "Who cleaned these pots? Not you, I"ll swear." So the maid had to up and out with the truth. Then the cook would have turned away the old maid and put on the new, but the latter would not hear of it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2196'>Her master"s son singled her out at once, and with the finest of bows engaged her as his partner for the rest of the night.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2197'>Next morning, however, the maids could talk of nothing but the beautiful stranger.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2202'>And sure enough, when she had upped and offed with her cap and robe of rushes, there he was at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='robe;cap' adjectives='sure' verbs='be;rush;off;determine;dance;up;have;come;wait' valence='5.7' arousal='3.85230769231' dominance='6.00769230769'>the door</entity> waiting for her to come; for he had determined to dance with no one else.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2204'>But once again Caporushes kept her own counsel and just slipped away on some excuse in time, so that when her fellow-servants came to their beds they found her in hers, pretending to be fast asleep; but her cheeks were all flushed and her breath came fast. So they said, "She is dreaming. We hope her dreams are happy."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2205'>But next morning they were full of what she had missed. Never was such a beautiful young gentleman as young master! Never was such a beautiful young lady! Never was such beautiful dancing! Every one else had stopped theirs to look on.</paragraph>

She didn"t even have to brush her beautiful golden hair! And once again she was in the ball-room in a trice, dancing away with young master, who never took his eyes off her, and implored her to tell him who she was. But she kept her own counsel and only told him that she never, never, never would come to dance any more, and that he must say good-bye. And he held her hand so fast that she had a job to get away, and lo and behold! his ring came off his finger, and as she ran up to her bed there it was in her hand!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2209'>"It was the noise you made coming upstairs," she made excuse; but they said, "Not we!

The young man, thinking he might have to travel a far way, and not knowing when or how he might get other provisions, said he would like to have the whole cake, come of his mother"s malison what might; so she gave him the whole cake, and her malison along with it. Then he took his brother aside, and gave him a knife to keep till he should come back, desiring him to look at it every morning, and as long as it continued to be clear, then he might be sure that the owner of it was well; but if it grew dim and rusty, then for certain some ill had befallen him.</paragraph>

The young man would have gone away, but he was afraid of the two-headed four-horned beasts outside; so he beseeched the old woman to hide him as best she could, and not tell the Ettin he was there.

So he went, but as he was bringing home the water, a raven over his head cried to him to look, and he would see that the water was running out. Now being a young man of sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some clay and patched up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake.

Then the old woman, who was a fairy, gave him a magic wand, that might yet be of service to him, if he took care to use it rightly; and she told him a great deal that would happen to him, and what he ought to do in all circumstances; and after that, she vanished in an instant, out of his sight.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2495'>So he called for his horse and rode away, and away, until he came to the poor man"s house, and there he found the poor man sitting at his doorstep very sad and doleful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2496'>"What is the matter, my friend?" asked he; and the poor man replied:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2497'>"May it please your honour, a little lass has just been born to our house; and we have five children already, and where the bread is to come from to fill the sixth mouth, we know not."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2498'>"If that be all your trouble," quoth the Baron readily, "mayhap I can help you: so don"t be down-hearted. I am just looking for such a little lass to companion my son, so, if you will, I will give you ten crowns for her."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2499'>Well! the man he nigh jumped for joy, since he was to get good money, and his daughter, so he thought, a good home. Therefore he brought out the child then and there, and the Baron, wrapping the babe in his cloak, rode away. But when he got to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thing;castle;stream' adjectives='little;swollen' verbs='say;fling;gallop;get' valence='6.015' arousal='4.097' dominance='5.563'>the river</entity> he flung the little thing into the swollen stream, and said to himself as he galloped back to his castle:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2500'>"There goes Fate!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2501'>But, you see, he was just sore mistaken.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2502'>Now the fisherman and his wife had no children, and they were just longing for a baby; so when the goodman saw the little lass he was overcome with joy, and took her home to his wife, who received her with open arms.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2503'>And there she grew up, the apple of their eyes, into the most beautiful maiden that ever was seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2504'>Now, when she was about fifteen years of age, it so happened that the Baron and his friends went a-hunting along the banks of the river and stopped to get a drink of water at the fisherman"s hut. And who should bring the water out but, as they thought, the fisherman"s daughter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2505'>Now the young men of the party noticed her beauty, and one of them said to the Baron, "She should marry well; read us her fate, since you are so learned in the art."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2506'>Then the Baron, scarce looking at her, said carelessly: "I could guess her fate! Some wretched yokel or other. But, to please you, I will cast her horoscope by the stars; so tell me, girl, what day you were born?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2507'>"That I cannot tell, sir," replied <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir' adjectives='' verbs='reply;pick;tell;be' valence='5.8275' arousal='4.02083333333' dominance='5.45416666667'>the girl</entity>, "for I was picked up in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sir' adjectives='' verbs='reply;pick;tell;be' valence='5.8275' arousal='4.02083333333' dominance='5.45416666667'>the river</entity> about fifteen years ago."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2508'>Then the Baron grew pale, for he guessed at once that she was the little lass he had flung into the stream, and that Fate had been stronger than he was. But he kept his own counsel and said nothing at the time. Afterwards, however, he thought out a plan, so he rode back and gave <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plan;letter' adjectives='' verbs='ride;think;give' valence='6.05444444444' arousal='4.3' dominance='5.54333333333'>the girl</entity> a letter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2509'>"See you!" he said. "I will make your fortune. Take this letter to my brother, who needs a good girl, and you will be settled for life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2510'>Now the fisherman and his wife were growing old and needed help; so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fisherman;help;letter;wife' adjectives='old' verbs='be;go;say;take;need;grow' valence='5.84307692308' arousal='4.06' dominance='5.56615384615'>the girl</entity> said she would go, and took the letter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2511'>And the Baron rode back to his castle saying to himself once more:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2512'>"There goes Fate!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2513'>For what he had written in the letter was this:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2514'>"DEAR BROTHER,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2515'>"Take the bearer and put her to death immediately."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2516'>But once again he was sore mistaken; since on the way to the town where his brother lived, the girl had to stop the night in a little inn. And it so happened that that very night a gang of thieves broke into the inn, and not content with carrying off all that the innkeeper possessed, they searched the pockets of the guests, and found the letter which the girl carried. And when they read it, they agreed that it was a mean trick and a shame. So their captain sat down and, taking pen and paper, wrote instead:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2517'>"DEAR BROTHER,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2518'>"Take the bearer and marry her to my son without delay."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2519'>Then, after putting the note into an envelope and sealing it up, they gave it to the girl and bade her go on her way. So when she arrived at the brother"s castle, though rather surprised, he gave orders for a wedding feast to be prepared. And the Baron"s son, who was staying with his uncle, seeing <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='baron;beauty;son;s;uncle;nothing' adjectives='great;loth;fast' verbs='be;see;wed;stay' valence='6.24214285714' arousal='4.14928571429' dominance='5.54'>the girl</entity>"s great beauty, was nothing loth, so they were fast wedded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2520'>Well! when the news was brought to the Baron, he was nigh beside himself; but he was determined not to be done by Fate. So he rode post-haste to his brother"s and pretended to be quite pleased. And then one day, when no one was nigh, he asked the young bride to come for a walk with him, and when they were close to some cliffs, seized hold of her, and was for throwing her over into the sea. But she begged hard for her life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2521'>"It is not my fault," she said. "I have done nothing. It is Fate. But if you will spare my life I promise that I will fight against Fate also.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2522'>Well! the Baron agreed to this.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2526'>Now one day, as she was cleaning a big fish, she looked out of the kitchen window, and who should she see driving up to dinner but the Baron and his young son, her husband.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2527'>And, lo and behold! she saw something shine in its inside, and there, sure enough, was the Baron"s ring! She was glad enough to see it, I can tell you; so she slipped it on to her thumb.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2528'>Well! when it came to table the guests liked it so well that they asked the host who cooked it. And he called to his servants, "Send up the cook who cooked that fine fish, that she may get her reward."</paragraph>

So she did what the old woman told her, and at last arrived at the Well of the World"s End. But when she dipped the sieve in the cold cold water, it all ran out again.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2720'>The stepmother was surprised indeed when she found the young prince instead of the nasty frog, and she was not best pleased, you may be sure, when the prince told her that he was going to marry her stepdaughter because she had unspelled him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2726'>But the boy"s mother was really a wicked witch-woman, and so jealous that she wanted all the boy"s love for herself, and when the girl-baby grew white as milk, with cheeks like roses and lips like cherries, and when her hair, shining like golden silk, hung down to her feet so that her father and all the neighbours began to praise her looks, the stepmother fairly hated her, and did all in her power to spoil her looks. She would set the child hard tasks, and send her out in all weathers to do difficult messages, and if they were not well performed would beat her and scold her cruelly.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2729'>So the little girl took the money and set off quickly through the snow, for already it was growing dark. Now there was such a wind blowing that it nearly blew her off her feet, and as she ran her beautiful hair got all tangled and almost tripped her up. However, she got the candles, paid for them, and started home again. But this time the wind was behind her and blew all her beautiful golden hair in front of her like a cloud, so that she could not see her steps, and, coming to a stile, had to stop and put down the bundle of candles in order to see how to get over it. And when she was climbing it a big black dog came by and ran off with the bunch of candles! Now she was so afraid of her stepmother that she durst not go home, but turned back and bought another bunch of candles at the grocer"s, and when she arrived at the stile once more, the same thing happened. A big black dog came down the road and ran away with the bunch of candles. So yet once again she journeyed back to the grocer"s through wind and snow, and, with her last penny, bought yet another bunch of candles. To no purpose, for alas, and alack-a-day! when she laid them down in order to part her beautiful golden hair and to see how to get over the stile, a big black dog ran away with them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2730'>So nothing was left save to go back to her stepmother in fear and trembling. But, for a wonder, her stepmother did not seem very angry.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2731'>Then she said to the child, "I must take the tangles out of your hair before you go to sleep. Come, put your head on my lap."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2739'>But first, because she was a wicked witch-woman, knowing spells and charms, she took out the heart of the little girl and made it into two savoury pasties, one for her husband"s breakfast and one for the little boy"s, for thus would the love they bore to the little girl become hers. Nevertheless, she was mistaken, for when morning came and the little child could not be found, the father sent away his breakfast barely tasted, and the little boy wept so that he could eat nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2740'>So they grieved and grieved. And when the snow melted and they found the bones of the poor child, they said, "She must have lost her way that dark night going to the grocer"s to buy candles."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2741'>Now when summer came the wild rose tree flowered. It was covered with white roses, and amongst the flowers there sate a beautiful white bird.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2742'>So at last the beautiful white bird unfolded its broad white wings and flew to a cobbler"s shop, where a myrtle bush hung over the man and his last, on which he was making a dainty little pair of rose-red shoes.

Then with the rose-red shoes in one foot and the golden chain in the other, the bird flew to an oak tree which overhung <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stream;chain;song;oak;bough;tree;millstone;shoe;miller;foot;bird' adjectives='busy;golden;other;rose-red' verbs='fly;be;perch;pick;sing;overhang' valence='5.95782608696' arousal='3.76260869565' dominance='5.56260869565'>the mill</entity> stream, beside which three millers were busy picking out a millstone, and, perching on a bough, sang its song ever so sweetly:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2761'>My father nigh ate me,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2764'>Stick!--"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2765'>Just then one of the millers put down his tool and listened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2766'>"Stock!" sang the bird.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2767'>And the second miller put aside his tool and listened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2768'>"Stone," sang the bird.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2769'>Then the third miller put aside his tool and listened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2770'>"Dead!" sang the bird so sweetly that with one accord the millers looked up and cried with one voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2771'>"Oh, what a beautiful song! Sing it again, dear bird, it is sweeter than a nightingale"s."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2772'>"That will I gladly," answered the bird, "if you will hang the millstone you are picking round my neck."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2773'>So the millers hung it as they were asked; and when the song was finished, the bird spread its wide white wings and, with the millstone round its neck and the little rose-red shoes in one foot, the golden chain in the other, it flew back to the rose tree. But the little playmate was not there; he was inside <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='dinner;playmate' adjectives='little' verbs='be;eat' valence='6.60857142857' arousal='3.94571428571' dominance='5.92571428571'>the house</entity> eating his dinner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2774'>Then the bird flew to the house, and rattled the millstone about the eaves until the stepmother cried, "Hearken! How it thunders!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2775'>So the little boy ran out to see, and down dropped the dainty rose-red shoes at his feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2776'>"See what fine things the thunder has brought!" he cried with glee as he ran back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2777'>Then the white bird rattled the millstone about the eaves once more, and once again the stepmother said, "Hearken! How it thunders!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2778'>So this time the father went out to see, and down dropped the golden chain about his neck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2779'>"It is true," he said when he came back. "The thunder does bring fine things!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2780'>Then once more the white bird rattled the millstone about the eaves, and this time the stepmother said hurriedly, "Hark! there it is again! Perhaps it has got something for me!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2781'>Then she ran out; but the moment she stepped outside <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='moment;right;head' adjectives='millstone' verbs='kill;step;run;fall' valence='5.26222222222' arousal='4.39777777778' dominance='5.56666666667'>the door</entity>, down fell the millstone right on her head and killed her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2782'>So that was an end of her. And after that the little boy was ever so much happier, and all the summer time he sate with his little rose-coloured shoes under the wild rose tree and listened to the white bird"s song. But when winter came and the wild rose tree was all barren and bare save for snowflake flowers, the white bird came no longer and the little boy grew tired of waiting for it. So one day he gave up altogether, and they buried him under the rose tree beside his little playmate.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2783'>Now when the spring came and the rose tree blossomed, the flowers were no longer white. They were edged with rose colour like the little boy"s shoes, and in the centre of each blossom there was a beautiful tuft of golden silk like the little girl"s hair.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2784'>And if you look in a wild rose you will find these things there still.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='233'>In the darksome depths of a thick forest lived Kalyb the fell enchantress. Terrible were her deeds, and few there were who had the hardihood to sound the brazen trumpet which hung over the iron gate that barred the way to the Abode of Witchcraft. Terrible were the deeds of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='deed;thing;babe;death' adjectives='terrible;innocent;new-born' verbs='be;delight;carry;put'>Kalyb</entity>; but above all things she delighted in carrying off innocent new-born babes, and putting them to death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='234'>u"And this, doubtless, she meant to be the fate of the infant son of the Earl of Coventry, who long long years ago was Lord High Steward of England. Certain it is that the babe"s father being absent, and his mother dying at his birth, the wicked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='babe;s;father;mother;birth;spell;charm;child;nurse' adjectives='certain;absent;wicked;careless' verbs='be;be;die;manage;steal'>Kalyb</entity>, with spells and charms, managed to steal the child from his careless nurses."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='235'>But the babe was marked from the first for doughty deeds; for on his breast was pictured the living image of a dragon, on his right hand was a blood-red cross, and on his left leg showed the golden garter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='236'>And these signs so affected Kalyb, the fell enchantress, that she stayed her hand; and the child growing daily in beauty and stature, he became to her as the apple of her eye. Now, when twice seven years had passed the boy began to thirst for honourable adventures, though the wicked enchantress wished to keep him as her own.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='237'>But he, seeking glory, utterly disdained so wicked a creature; thus she sought to bribe him. And one day, taking him by the hand, she led him to a brazen castle and showed him six brave knights, prisoners therein. Then said she:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='238'>"Lo! These be the six champions of Christendom. Thou shalt be the seventh and thy name shall be <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='name' adjectives='' verbs='be;be;stay'>St. George of Merrie England</entity> if thou wilt stay with me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='239'>But he would not.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='240'>Then she led him into a magnificent stable where stood seven of the most beautiful steeds ever seen. "Six of these," said she, "belong to the six Champions. The seventh and the best, the swiftest and the most powerful in the world, whose name is <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='world;name' adjectives='best;swiftest;powerful' verbs='be;bestow;stay'>Bayard</entity>, will I bestow on thee, if thou wilt stay with me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='241'>But he would not.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='242'>Then she took him to the armoury, and with her own hand buckled on a corselet of purest steel, and laced on a helmet inlaid with gold. Then, taking a mighty falchion, she gave it into his hand, and said: "This armour which none can pierce, this sword called Ascalon, which will hew in sunder all it touches, are thine; surely now thou wilt stop with me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='243'>But he would not.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='244'>Then she bribed him with her own magic wand, thus giving him power over all things in that enchanted land, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='245'>"Surely now wilt thou remain here?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='246'>But he, taking the wand, struck with it a mighty rock that stood by; and lo! it opened, and laid in view a wide cave garnished by the bodies of a vast number of innocent new-born infants whom the wicked enchantress had murdered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='247'>Thus, using her power, he bade the sorceress lead the way into the place of horror, and when she had entered, he raised the magic wand yet again, and smote the rock; and lo! it closed for ever, and the sorceress was left to bellow forth her lamentable complaints to senseless stones.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='248'>Thus was St. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='st.;land;champion;steed;city' adjectives='enchanted;other' verbs='be;free;take;mount;ride'>George</entity> freed from the enchanted land, and taking with him the six other champions of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='st.;land;champion;steed;city' adjectives='enchanted;other' verbs='be;free;take;mount;ride'>Christendom</entity> on their steeds, he mounted <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='st.;land;champion;steed;city' adjectives='enchanted;other' verbs='be;free;take;mount;ride'>Bayard</entity> and rode to the city of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='st.;land;champion;steed;city' adjectives='enchanted;other' verbs='be;free;take;mount;ride'>Coventry</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='249'>Here for nine months they abode, exercising themselves in all feats of arms. So when spring returned they set forth, as knights errant, to seek for foreign adventure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='250'>And for thirty days and thirty nights they rode on, until, at the beginning of a new month, they came to a great wide plain. Now in the centre of this plain, where seven several ways met, there stood a great brazen pillar, and here, with high heart and courage, they bade each other farewell, and each took a separate road.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='251'>u"Hence, St. George, on his charger Bayard, rode till he reached the seashore where lay a good ship bound for the land of Egypt. Taking passage in her, after long journeying he arrived in that land when the silent wings of night were outspread, and darkness brooded on all things. Here, coming to a poor hermitage, he begged a night"s lodging, on which the hermit replied:"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='252'>"Sir Knight of Merrie England--for I see her arms graven on thy breastplate--thou hast come hither in an ill time, when those alive are scarcely able to bury the dead by reason of the cruel destruction waged by a terrible dragon, who ranges up and down the country by day and by night. If he have not an innocent maiden to devour each day, he sends a mortal plague amongst the people. And this has not ceased for twenty and four years, so that there is left throughout the land but one maiden, the beautiful Sbia, daughter to the King. And to-morrow must she die, unless some brave knight will slay the monster.

Moved by compassion he dismounted, and bowing low before the lady entreated her to return to her father"s palace, since he was about to kill the dreaded dragon. Whereupon the beautiful <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='whereupon;smile;tear;re-mounting;emprise' adjectives='beautiful' verbs='thank;do;request;ride'>Sbia</entity>, thanking him with smiles and tears, did as he requested, and he, re-mounting, rode on his emprise."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='258'>u"Now, by great good chance, St. George was flung under the shade of a flowering orange tree, whose fragrance hath this virtue in it, that no poisonous beast dare come within the compass of its branches. So there the valiant knight had time to recover his senses, until with eager courage he rose, and rushing to the combat, smote the burning dragon on his burnished belly with his trusty sword Ascalon; and thereinafter spouted out such black venom, as, falling on the armour of the Knight, burst it in twain. And ill might it have fared with St. George of Merrie England but for the orange tree, which once again gave him shelter under its branches, where, seeing the issue of the fight was in the Hands of the Most High, he knelt and prayed that such strength of body should be given him as would enable him to prevail. Then with a bold and courageous heart, he advanced again, and smote the fiery dragon under one of his flaming wings, so that the weapon pierced the heart, and all the grass around turned crimson with the blood that flowed from the dying monster.

But he was helpless, and when sentence had been passed upon him, he was thrown into a loathly dungeon, clothed in base and servile weeds, and his arms strongly fettered up to iron bolts, while the roars of the two hungry lions who were to devour him ere long, deafened his ears. Now his rage and fury at this black treachery was such that it gave him strength, and with mighty effort he drew the staples that held his fetters; so being part free he tore his long locks of amber-coloured hair from his head and wound them round his arms instead of gauntlets. So prepared he rushed on the lions when they were let loose upon him, and thrusting his arms down their throats choked them, and thereinafter tearing out their very hearts, held them up in triumph to the gaolers who stood by trembling with fear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='266'>After this the King of Persia gave up the hopes of putting St. George to death, and, doubling the bars of the dungeon, left him to languish therein.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='267'>u"At last one day, in a dark corner of his dungeon, he found one of the iron staples he had drawn in his rage and fury. It was half consumed with rust, yet it was sufficient in his hands to open a passage through the walls of his cell into the King"s garden. It was the time of night when all things are silent; but St. George, listening, heard the voices of grooms in the stables; which, entering, he found two grooms furnishing forth a horse against some business. Whereupon, taking the staple with which he had redeemed himself from prison, he slew the grooms, and mounting the palfrey rode boldly to the city gates, where he told the watchman at the Bronze Tower that St. George having escaped from the dungeon, he was in hot pursuit of him. Whereupon the gates were thrown open, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='whereupon;gate;horse;pursuit;beam;sun;sky' adjectives='open;safe;red' verbs='be;throw;clap;spur;find;shoot'>St. George</entity>, clapping spurs to his horse, found himself safe from pursuit before the first red beams of the sun shot up into the sky."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='268'>Now, ere long, being most famished with hunger, he saw a tower set on a high cliff, and riding thitherward determined to ask for food.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='269'>"Lady! If thou hast sorrow of thine own, succour one also in distress, and give me, a Christian Knight, now almost famished, one meal\"s meat." To which she replied quickly:</paragraph>

He was a monstrous giant, deformed, with a huge head, bristled like any boar"s, with hot, glaring eyes and a mouth equalling a tiger"s. At first sight of him St. George gave himself up for lost, not so much for fear, but for hunger and faintness of body. Still, commending himself to the Most High, he also rushed to the combat with such poor arms as he had, and with many a regret for the loss of his magic sword Ascalon. So they fought till noon, when, just as the champion"s strength was nigh finished, the giant stumbled on the root of a tree, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='champion;s;strength;root;tree;chance;mid-rib' adjectives='nigh;giant' verbs='fight;be;finish;stumble;take;run;gasp;die'>St. George</entity>, taking his chance, ran him through the mid-rib, so that he gasped and died."</paragraph>

And they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle-sized Bear; and a great bed for the Great Big Bear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='311'>First she tasted the porridge of the Great Big Bear, and that was too hot for her. Next she tasted the porridge of the Middle-sized Bear, but that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up, every bit!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='312'>Then Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a bad-tempered little girl.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='313'>Now, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='314'>By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='354'>Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='357'>TOM-TIT-TOT</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='358'>Once upon a time there was a woman and she baked five pies. But when they came out of the oven they were over-baked, and the crust was far too hard to eat. So she said to her daughter:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='359'>"Daughter," says she, "put them pies on to the shelf and leave \"em there awhile. Surely they\"ll come again in time."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='360'>By that, you know, she meant that they would become softer; but her daughter said to herself, "If Mother says the pies will come again, why shouldn\"t I eat these now?" So, having good, young teeth, she set to work and ate the lot, first and last.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='361'>Now when supper-time came the woman said to her daughter, "Go you and get one of the pies. They are sure to have come again by now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='362'>Then the girl went and looked, but of course there was nothing but the empty dishes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='363'>So back she came and said, "No, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='t' adjectives='' verbs='come;say;ain;come'>Mother</entity>, they ain\"t come again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='364'>"Not one o\" them?" asked the mother, taken aback like.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>"Not one o\" them," says the daughter, quite confident.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>"Well," says the mother, "come again, or not come again, I will have one of them pies for my supper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='367'>"But you can\"t," says the daughter. "How can you if they ain\"t come? And they ain\"t, as sure\"s sure."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='368'>"But I can," says the mother, getting angry. "Go you at once, child, and bring me the best on them. My teeth must just tackle it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='369'>"Best or worst is all one," answered the daughter, quite sulky, "for I\"ve ate the lot, so you can\"t have one till it comes again--so there!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='370'>Well, the mother she bounced up to see; but half an eye told her there was nothing save the empty dishes; so she was dished up herself and done for.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='371'>So, having no supper, she sate her down on the doorstep, and, bringing out her distaff, began to spin. And as she span she sang:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='372'>"My daughter ha\" ate five pies to-day,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='373'>u" My daughter ha" ate five pies to-day,"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='374'>My daughter ha\" ate five pies to-day,"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='375'>for, see you, she was quite flabbergasted and fair astonished.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='376'>Now the King of that country happened to be coming down the street, and he heard the song going on and on, but could not quite make out the words. So he stopped his horse, and asked:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='377'>"What is that you are singing, my good woman?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='378'>[Illustration: "What is that you are singing, my good woman?"]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='379'>u"Now the mother, though horrified at her daughter"s appetite, did not want other folk, leastwise the King, to know about it, so she sang instead:"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>"My daughter ha\" spun five skeins to-day,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='381'>u" My daughter ha" spun five skeins to-day,"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='382'>My daughter ha\" spun five skeins to-day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='383'>"Five skeins!" cried the King. "By my garter and my crown, I never heard tell of any one who could do that! Look you here, I have been searching for a maiden to wife, and your daughter who can spin five skeins a day is the very one for me. Only, mind you, though for eleven months of the year she shall be Queen indeed, and have all she likes to eat, all the gowns she likes to get, all the company she likes to keep, and everything her heart desires, in the twelfth month she must set to work and spin five skeins a day, and if she does not she must die. Come! is it a bargain?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='384'>So the mother agreed. She thought what a grand marriage it was for her daughter. And as for the five skeins? Time enough to bother about them when the year came round. There was many a slip between cup and lip, and, likely as not, the King would have forgotten all about it by then.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='385'>u"Anyhow, her daughter would be Queen for eleven months. So they were married, and for eleven months the bride was happy as happy could be. She had everything she liked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get, all the company she cared to keep, and everything her heart desired. And her husband the King was kind as kind could be. But in the tenth month she began to think of those five skeins and wonder if the King remembered. And in the eleventh month she began to dream about them as well. But ne"er a word did the King, her husband, say about them; so she hoped he had forgotten."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>But on the very last day of the eleventh month, the King, her husband, led her into a room she had never set eyes on before. It had one window, and there was nothing in it but a stool and a spinning-wheel.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>"Now, my dear," he said quite kind like, "you will be shut in here to-morrow morning with some victuals and some flax, and if by evening you have not spun five skeins, your head will come off."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='388'>u"Well she was fair frightened, for she had always been such a gatless thoughtless girl that she had never learnt to spin at all. So what she was to do on the morrow she could not tell; for, see you, she had no one to help her; for, of course, now she was Queen, her mother didn"t live nigh her. So she just locked the door of her room, sat down on a stool, and cried and cried and cried until her pretty eyes were all red."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='389'>Now as she sate sobbing and crying she heard a queer little noise at the bottom of the door. At first she thought it was a mouse. Then she thought it must be something knocking.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='390'>So she upped and opened the door and what did she see? Why! a small, little, black Thing with a long tail that whisked round and round ever so fast.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='391'>"What are you crying for?" said that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bow;tail' adjectives='' verbs='say;make;twirl;see'>Thing</entity>, making a bow, and twirling its tail so fast that she could scarcely see it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='392'>"What\"s that to you?" said she, shrinking a bit, for that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bit' adjectives='queer' verbs='say;shrink;be'>Thing</entity> was very queer like.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='393'>"Don\"t look at my tail if you\"re frightened," says That, smirking. "Look at my toes. Ain\"t they beautiful?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='394'>And sure enough That had on buckled shoes with high heels and big bows, ever so smart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='395'>[Illustration: A small, little, black Thing with a long tail]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='396'>So she kind of forgot about the tail, and wasn\"t so frightened, and when That asked her again why she was crying, she upped and said, "It won\"t do no good if I do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='397'>"You don\"t know that," says That, twirling its tail faster and faster, and sticking out its toes. "Come, tell me, there\"s a good girl."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>"Well," says she, "it can\"t do any harm if it doesn\"t do good." So she dried her pretty eyes and told That all about the pies, and the skeins, and everything from first to last.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='399'>And then that little, black Thing nearly burst with laughing. "If that is all, it\"s easy mended!" it says. "I\"ll come to your window every morning, take the flax, and bring it back spun into five skeins at night. Come! shall it be a bargain?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='400'>Now she, for all she was so gatless and thoughtless, said, cautious like:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='401'>"But what is your pay?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='402'>Then That twirled its tail so fast you couldn\"t see it, and stuck out its beautiful toes, and smirked and looked out of the corners of its eyes. "I will give you three guesses every night to guess my name, and if you haven\"t guessed it before the month is up, why"--and That twirled its tail faster and stuck out its toes further, and smirked and sniggered more than ever--"you shall be mine, my beauty."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='403'>Three guesses every night for a whole month! She felt sure she would be able for so much; and there was no other way out of the business, so she just said, "Yes! I agree!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='404'>And lor! how That twirled its tail, and bowed, and smirked, and stuck out its beautiful toes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='405'>u"Well, the very next day her husband led her to the strange room again, and there was the day"s food, and a spinning-wheel and a great bundle of flax."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='406'>"There you are, my dear," says he as polite as polite. "And remember! if there are not five whole skeins to-night, I fear your head will come off!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='407'>At that she began to tremble, and after he had gone away and locked the door, she was just thinking of a good cry, when she heard a queer knocking at the window. She upped at once and opened it, and sure enough there was the small, little, black Thing sitting on the window-ledge, dangling its beautiful toes and twirling its tail so that you could scarcely see it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='408'>"Good-morning, my beauty," says That. "Come! hand over the flax, sharp, there\"s a good girl."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='409'>u"So she gave That the flax and shut the window and, you may be sure, ate her victuals, for, as you know, she had a good appetite, and the King, her husband, had promised to give her everything she liked to eat. So she ate to her heart"s content, and when evening came and she heard that queer knocking at the window again, she upped and opened it, and there was the small, little, black Thing with five spun skeins on his arm!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='410'>And it twirled its tail faster than ever, and stuck out its beautiful toes, and bowed and smirked and gave her the five skeins.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='411'>Then That said, "And now, my beauty, what is That\"s name?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='412'>And she answered quite easy like:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='413'>"That is <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be'>Bill</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='414'>"No, it ain\"t," says That, and twirled its tail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='415'>"Then That is <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;say'>Ned</entity>," says she.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='416'>"No, it ain\"t," says That, and twirled its tail faster.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='417'>"Well," says she a bit more thoughtful, "That is <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bit' adjectives='thoughtful' verbs='say;be'>Mark</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='418'>"No, it ain\"t," says That, and laughs and laughs and laughs, and twirls its tail so as you couldn\"t see it, as away it flew.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='419'>Well, when the King, her husband, came in, he was fine and pleased to see the five skeins all ready for him, for he was fond of his pretty wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='420'>"I shall not have to order your head off, my dear," says he. "And I hope all the other days will pass as happily." Then he said good-night and locked the door and left her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='421'>But next morning they brought her fresh flax and even more delicious foods. And the small, little, black Thing came knocking at the window and stuck out its beautiful toes and twirled its tail faster and faster, and took away the bundle of flax and brought it back all spun into five skeins by evening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='422'>u"Then That made her guess three times what That"s name was; but she could not guess right, and That laughed and laughed and laughed as it flew away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='423'>Now every morning and evening the same thing happened, and every evening she had her three guesses; but she never guessed right. And every day the small, little, black Thing laughed louder and louder and smirked more and more, and looked at her quite maliceful out of the corners of its eyes until she began to get frightened, and instead of eating all the fine foods left for her, spent the day in trying to think of names to say. But she never hit upon the right one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>So it came to the last day of the month but one, and when the small, little, black Thing arrived in the evening with the five skeins of flax all ready spun, it could hardly say for smirking:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='425'>"Ain\"t you got That\"s name yet?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='426'>So says she--for she had been reading her Bible:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='427'>"Is That <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be'>Nicodemus</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='428'>"No, it ain\"t," says That, and twirled its tail faster than you could see.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='429'>"Is That Samuel?" says she all of a flutter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='430'>"No, it ain\"t, my beauty," chuckles That, looking maliceful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='431'>"Well--is That Methuselah?" says she, inclined to cry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='432'>Then That just fixes her with eyes like a coal a-fire, and says, "No, it ain\"t that neither, so there is only to-morrow night and then you\"ll be mine, my beauty."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='433'>u"And away the small, little, black Thing flew, its tail twirling and whisking so fast that you couldn"t see it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='434'>Well, she felt so bad she couldn\"t even cry; but she heard the King, her husband, coming to the door, so she made bold to be cheerful, and tried to smile when he said, "Well done, wife! Five skeins again! I shall not have to order your head off after all, my dear, of that I\"m quite sure, so let us enjoy ourselves." Then he bade the servants bring supper, and a stool for him to sit beside his Queen, and down they sat, lover-like, side by side.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='435'>u"But the poor Queen could eat nothing; she could not forget the small, little, black Thing. And the King hadn"t eaten but a mouthful or two when he began to laugh, and he laughed so long and so loud that at last the poor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;hadn;t;mouthful;laugh' adjectives='long;loud;last;poor;lackadaisical' verbs='eat;begin;laugh;be;say'>Queen</entity>, all lackadaisical as she was, said:"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='436'>"Why do you laugh so?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>"At something I saw to-day, my love," says the King. "I was out a-hunting, and by chance I came to a place I\"d never been in before. It was in a wood, and there was an old chalk-pit there, and out of the chalk-pit there came a queer kind of a sort of a humming, humming noise. So I got off my hobby to see what made it, and went quite quiet to the edge of the pit and looked down. And what do you think I saw? The funniest, queerest, smallest, little, black Thing you ever set eyes upon. And it had a little spinning-wheel and it was spinning away for dear life, but the wheel didn\"t go so fast as its tail, and that span round and round--_ho-ho-ha-ha!_--you never saw the like. And its little feet had buckled shoes and bows on them, and they went up and down in a desperate hurry. And all the time that small, little, black Thing kept bumming and booming away at these words:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='438'>"Name me, name me not,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='439'>Who\"ll guess it\"s Tom-Tit-Tot."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='440'>Well, when she heard these words the Queen nearly jumped out of her skin for joy; but she managed to say nothing, but ate her supper quite comfortably.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='441'>u"And she said no word when next morning the small, little, black Thing came for the flax, though it looked so gleeful and maliceful that she could hardly help laughing, knowing she had got the better of it. And when night came and she heard that knocking against the window-panes, she put on a wry face, and opened the window slowly as if she was afraid. But that Thing was as bold as brass and came right inside, grinning from ear to ear. And oh, my goodness! how That"s tail was twirling and whisking!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='442'>"Well, my beauty," says That, giving her the five skeins all ready spun, "what\"s my name?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='443'>Then she put down her lip, and says, tearful like, "Is--is--That--<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lip' adjectives='tearful' verbs='put;say;be;be'>Solomon</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='444'>"No, it ain\"t," laughs That, smirking out of the corner of That\"s eye. And the small, little, black Thing came further into the room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='445'>So she tried again--and this time she seemed hardly able to speak for fright.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='446'>"Well--is That--Zebedee?" she says.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='447'>"No, it ain\"t," cried the impet, full of glee. And it came quite close and stretched out its little black hands to her, and O-oh, ITS TAIL...!!!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='448'>"Take time, my beauty," says That, sort of jeering like, and its small, little, black eyes seemed to eat her up. "Take time! Remember! next guess and you\"re mine!" Well, she backed just a wee bit from it, for it was just horrible to look at; but then she laughed out and pointed her finger at it and said, says she:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='459'>THE GOLDEN SNUFF-BOX</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>u" Once upon a time, and a very good time too, though it was not in my time, nor your time, nor for the matter of that in any one"s time, there lived a man and a woman who had one son called Jack, and he was just terribly fond of reading books. He read, and he read, and then, because his parents lived in a lonely house in a lonely forest and he never saw any other folk but his father and his mother, he became quite crazy to go out into the world and see charming princesses and the like."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='461'>So one day he told his mother he must be off, and she called him an air-brained addle-pate, but added that, as he was no use at home, he had better go seek his fortune. Then she asked him if he would rather take a small cake with her blessing to eat on his journey, or a large cake with her curse? Now <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lad' adjectives='hungry' verbs='be;say'>Jack</entity> was a very hungry lad, so he just up and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='462'>"A big cake, if you please, \"m."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>So his mother made a great big cake, and when he started she just off to the top of the house and cast malisons on him, till he got out of sight. You see she had to do it, but after that she sate down and cried.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='464'>u"Well, Jack hadn"t gone far till he came to a field where his father was ploughing. Now the goodman was dreadfully put out when he found his son was going away, and still more so when he heard he had chosen his mother"s malison. So he cast about what to do to put things straight, and at last he drew out of his pocket a little golden snuff-box, and gave it to the lad, saying:"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='465'>"If ever you are in danger of sudden death you may open the box; but not till then. It has been in our family for years and years; but, as we have lived, father and son, quietly in the forest, none of us have ever been in need of help--perhaps you may."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='466'>So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='snuff-box;way' adjectives='golden' verbs='pocket;go'>Jack</entity> pocketed the golden snuff-box and went on his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='467'>Now, after a time, he grew very tired, and very hungry, for he had eaten his big cake first thing, and night closed in on him so that he could scarce see his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='468'>u"But at last he came to a large house and begged board and lodging at the back door. Now Jack was a good-looking young fellow, so the maid-servant at once called him in to the fireside and gave him plenty good meat and bread and beer. And it so happened that while he was eating his supper the master"s gay young daughter came into the kitchen and saw him. So she went to her father and said that there was the prettiest young fellow she had ever seen in the back kitchen, and that if her father loved her he would give the young man some employment. Now the gentleman of the house was exceedingly fond of his gay young daughter, and did not want to vex her; so he went into the back kitchen and questioned <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gentleman;house;daughter;kitchen' adjectives='fond;gay;young;back' verbs='be;do;want;vex;go;question;do'>Jack</entity> as to what he could do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='469'>"Anything," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='anything;meaning;course;bit;work;house' adjectives='foolish' verbs='say;do'>Jack</entity> gaily, meaning, of course, that he could do any foolish bit of work about a house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='470'>But the gentleman saw a way of pleasing his gay young daughter and getting rid of the trouble of employing Jack; so he laughs and says, "If you can do anything, my good lad," says he, "you had better do this. By eight o\"clock to-morrow morning you must have dug a lake four miles round in front of my mansion, and on it there must be floating a whole fleet of vessels. And they must range up in front of my mansion and fire a salute of guns. And the very last shot must break the leg of the four-post bed on which my daughter sleeps, for she is always late of a morning!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='471'>Well! <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;flabbergast;falter'>Jack</entity> was terribly flabbergasted, but he faltered out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='472'>"And if I don\"t do it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='473'>"Then," said the master of the house quite calmly, "your life will be the forfeit."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='474'>So he bade the servants take <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='servant;turret-room;door' adjectives='' verbs='bid;take;lock'>Jack</entity> to a turret-room and lock the door on him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='475'>u"Well! Jack sate on the side of his bed and tried to think things out, but he felt as if he didn"t know _b_ from a battledore, so he decided to think no more, and after saying his prayers he lay down and went to sleep. And he did sleep! When he woke it was close on eight o"clock, and he had only time to fly to the window and look out, when the great clock on the tower began to whirr before it struck the hour. And there was the lawn in front of the house all set with beds of roses and stocks and marigolds! Well! all of a sudden he remembered the little golden snuff-box."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='476'>"I\"m near enough to death," quoth he to himself, as he drew it out and opened it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='477'>And no sooner had he opened it than out hopped three funny little red men in red night-caps, rubbing their eyes and yawning; for, see you, they had been locked up in the box for years, and years, and years.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='478'>"What do you want, Master?" they said between their yawns. But Jack heard that clock a-whirring and knew he hadn\"t a moment to lose, so he just gabbled off his orders. Then the clock began to strike, and the little men flew out of the window, and suddenly</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='479'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='480'>Bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='481'>went the guns, and the last one must have broken the leg of the four-post bed, for there at the window was the gay young daughter in her nightcap, gazing with astonishment at the lake four miles round, with the fleet of vessels floating on it!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='482'>And so did Jack! He had never seen such a sight in his life, and he was quite sorry when the three little red men disturbed him by flying in at the window and scrambling into the golden snuff-box.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='483'>"Give us a little more time when you want us next, Master," they said sulkily. Then they shut down the lid, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lid' adjectives='' verbs='shut;hear;yawn;settle;sleep'>Jack</entity> could hear them yawning inside as they settled down to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='484'>As you may imagine, the master of the house was fair astonished, while as for the gay young daughter, she declared at once that she would never marry any one else but the young man who could do such wonderful things; the truth being that she and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='master;house;daughter;man;thing;truth;love;sight' adjectives='fair;astonished;gay;young;else;young;such;wonderful;other' verbs='imagine;be;declare;marry;do;be;have;fall'>Jack</entity> had fallen in love with each other at first sight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='485'>But her father was cautious. "It is true, my dear," says he, "that the young fellow seems a bully boy; but for aught we know it may be chance, not skill, and he may have a broken feather in his wing. So we must try him again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='486'>Then he said to Jack, "My daughter must have a fine house to live in. Therefore by to-morrow morning at eight o\"clock there must be a magnificent castle standing on twelve golden pillars in the middle of the lake, and there must be a church beside it. And all things must be ready for the bride, and at eight o\"clock precisely a peal of bells from the church must ring out for the wedding. If not you will have to forfeit your life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='487'>This time Jack intended to give the three little red men more time for their task; but what with having enjoyed himself so much all day, and having eaten so much good food, he overslept himself, so that the big clock on the tower was whirring before it struck eight when he woke, leapt out of bed, and rushed to the golden snuff-box. But he had forgotten where he had put it, and so the clock had _really_ begun to strike before he found it under his pillow, opened it, and gabbled out his orders. And then you never saw how the three little red men tumbled over each other and yawned and stretched and made haste all at one time, so that Jack thought his life would surely be forfeit. But just as the clock struck its last chime, out rang a peal of merry bells, and there was the Castle standing on twelve golden pillars and a church beside it in the middle of the lake. And the Castle was all decorated for the wedding, and there were crowds and crowds of servants and retainers, all dressed in their Sunday best.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='488'>Never had Jack seen such a sight before; neither had the gay young daughter who, of course, was looking out of the next window in her nightcap. And she looked so pretty and so gay that Jack felt quite cross when he had to step back to let the three little red men fly to their golden snuff-box. But they were far crosser than he was, and mumbled and grumbled at the hustle, so that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hustle;box' adjectives='crosser;glad' verbs='be;be;mumble;grumble;be;shut;begin;snore'>Jack</entity> was quite glad when they shut the box down and began to snore.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='489'>Well, of course, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;daughter;clothes;food;servant;friend' adjectives='gay;young;happy;fine;fine;fine;many;fine' verbs='be;marry;be;be;have;wear;eat;wait;like'>Jack</entity> and the gay young daughter were married, and were as happy as the day is long; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;daughter;clothes;food;servant;friend' adjectives='gay;young;happy;fine;fine;fine;many;fine' verbs='be;marry;be;be;have;wear;eat;wait;like'>Jack</entity> had fine clothes to wear, fine food to eat, fine servants to wait on him, and as many fine friends as he liked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='490'>u"So he was in luck; but he had yet to learn that a mother"s malison is sure to bring misfortune some time or another."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='491'>Thus it happened that one day when he was going a-hunting with all the ladies and gentlemen, Jack forgot to change the golden snuff-box (which he always carried about with him for fear of accidents) from his waistcoat pocket to that of his scarlet hunting-coat; so he left it behind him. And what should happen but that the servant let it fall on the ground when he was folding up the clothes, and the snuff-box flew open and out popped the three little red men yawning and stretching.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='492'>u"Well! when they found out that they hadn"t really been summoned, and that there was no fear of death, they were in a towering temper and said they had a great mind to fly away with the Castle, golden pillars and all."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='493'>On hearing this the servant pricked up his ears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='494'>"Could you do that?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='495'>"Could we?" they said, and they laughed loud. "Why, we can do anything."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='496'>Then the servant said ever so sharp, "Then move me this Castle and all it contains right away over the sea where the master can\"t disturb us."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='497'>Now the little red men need not really have obeyed the order, but they were so cross with Jack that hardly had the servant said the words before the task was done; so when the hunting-party came back, lo and behold! the Castle, and the church, and the golden pillars had all disappeared!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='498'>u"At first all the rest set upon <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rest;knave;wife;s;father;daughter;castle' adjectives='particular;gay;young;last' verbs='set;be;cheat;threaten;have;deceive;agree;let;have;find;bring'>Jack</entity> for being a knave and a cheat; and, in particular, his wife"s father threatened to have at him for deceiving the gay young daughter; but at last he agreed to let <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rest;knave;wife;s;father;daughter;castle' adjectives='particular;gay;young;last' verbs='set;be;cheat;threaten;have;deceive;agree;let;have;find;bring'>Jack</entity> have twelve months and a day to find the Castle and bring it back."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='499'>So off <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;money;pocket' adjectives='good' verbs='start'>Jack</entity> starts on a good horse with some money in his pocket.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='500'>u"And he travelled far and he travelled fast, and he travelled east and west, north and south, over hills, and dales, and valleys, and mountains, and woods, and sheepwalks, but never a sign of the missing castle did he see. Now at last he came to the palace of the King of all the Mice in the Wide World. And there was a little mousie in a fine hauberk and a steel cap doing sentry at the front gate, and he was not for letting Jack in until he had told his errand. And when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mouse;sentry;gate;degree;king;s;chamber;mouse;courtier' adjectives='next;inner' verbs='have;tell;pass;reach;sate;surround'>Jack</entity> had told it, he passed him on to the next mouse sentry at the inner gate; so by degrees he reached the King"s chamber, where he sate surrounded by mice courtiers."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='501'>Now the King of the Mice received Jack very graciously, and said that he himself knew nothing of the missing Castle, but, as he was King of all the Mice in the whole world, it was possible that some of his subjects might know more than he. So he ordered his chamberlain to command a Grand Assembly for the next morning, and in the meantime he entertained <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chamberlain;meantime' adjectives='' verbs='order;command;entertain'>Jack</entity> right royally.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='502'>But the next morning, though there were brown mice, and black mice, and grey mice, and white mice, and piebald mice, from all parts of the world, they all answered with one breath:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>"If it please your Majesty, we have not seen the missing Castle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='504'>Then the King said, "You must go and ask my elder brother the King of all the Frogs. He may be able to tell you. Leave your horse here and take one of mine. It knows the way and will carry you safe."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='505'>u"So Jack set off on the King"s horse, and as he passed the outer gate he saw the little mouse sentry coming away, for its guard was up. Now Jack was a kind-hearted lad, and he had saved some crumbs from his dinner in order to recompense the little sentry for his kindness. So he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the crumbs."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='506'>"Here you are, mousekin," he said. "That\"s for your trouble!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='507'>Then the mouse thanked him kindly and asked if he would take him along to the King of the Frogs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='508'>"Not I," says Jack. "I should get into trouble with your King."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='509'>But the mousekin insisted. "I may be of some use to you," it said. So it ran up the horse\"s hind leg and up by its tail and hid in Jack\"s pocket. And the horse set off at a hard gallop, for it didn\"t half like the mouse running over it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='510'>u"So at last Jack came to the palace of the King of all the Frogs, and there at the front gate was a frog doing sentry in a fine coat of mail and a brass helmet. And the frog sentry was for not letting Jack in; but the mouse called out that they came from the King of all the Mice and must be let in without delay. So they were taken to the King"s chamber, where he sate surrounded by frog courtiers in fine clothes; but alas! he had heard nothing of the Castle on golden pillars, and though he summoned all the frogs of all the world to a Grand Assembly next morning, they all answered his question with:"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='511'>"_Kro kro, Kro kro_"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='512'>which every one knows stands for "No" in frog language.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='513'>So the King said to Jack, "There remains but one thing. You must go and ask my eldest brother, the King of all the Birds.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='514'>u"So Jack set off, and being a kind-hearted lad he gave the frog sentry, whom he met coming away from his guard, some crumbs he had saved from his dinner.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='515'>Then the horse galloped away like lightning, for it didn\"t like the slimy frog coming down "plop" on its back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='516'>Well, after a time, Jack came to the palace of the King of all the Birds, and there at the front gate were a sparrow and a crow marching up and down with matchlocks on their shoulders.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='517'>"We come from the King! Sirrahs! Let us pass."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='518'>So that the sentries were right mazed, and let them pass in without more ado.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='519'>u"But when they came to the King"s chamber, where he sate surrounded by all manner of birds, tomtits, wrens, cormorants, turtle-doves, and the like, the King said he was sorry, but he had no news of the missing Castle. And though he summoned all the birds of all the world to a Grand Assembly next morning, not one of them had seen or heard tell of it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='520'>So Jack was quite disconsolate till the King said, "But where is the eagle? I don\"t see my eagle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='521'>Then the Chamberlain--he was a tomtit--stepped forward with a bow and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='524'>u"So two larks flew up into the sky till they couldn"t be seen and sang ever so loud, till at last the eagle appeared all in a perspiration from having flown so fast."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='525'>Then the King said, "Sirrah! Have you seen a missing Castle that stands upon twelve pillars of gold?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='528'>And they flew over land and they flew over sea, until at last in the far distance they saw the Castle standing on its twelve golden pillars. But all the doors and windows were fast shut and barred, for, see you, the servant-master who had run away with it had gone out for the day a-hunting, and he always bolted doors and windows while he was absent lest some one else should run away with it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='529'>Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='snuff-box;mouse' adjectives='golden;little' verbs='be;puzzle;think;get;hold;say'>Jack</entity> was puzzled to think how he should get hold of the golden snuff-box, until the little mouse said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='531'>u"So it went off, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eagle;s;wing;fume;mousekin' adjectives='last' verbs='go;wait;appear'>Jack</entity> waited on the eagle"s wings in a fume; till at last mousekin appeared."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='535'>u"So every one rejoiced exceedingly, and they set off back to the palace of the King of all the Birds, where Jack had left his horse; for now that he had the golden snuff-box safe he knew he could get the Castle back whenever he chose to send the three little red men to fetch it. But on the way over the sea, while Jack, who was dead tired with standing so long, lay down between the eagle"s wings and fell asleep, the mouse and the eagle fell to quarrelling as to which of them had helped Jack the most, and they quarrelled so much that at last they laid the case before the frog. Then the frog, who made a very wise judge, said he must see the whole affair from the very beginning; so the mouse brought out the golden snuff-box from Jack"s pocket, and began to relate where it had been found and all about it. Now, at that very moment <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='moment;leg;snuff-box;sea' adjectives='plump;golden;bottom' verbs='awake;kick;go'>Jack</entity> awoke, kicked out his leg, and plump went the golden snuff-box down to the very bottom of the sea!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='537'>Well, they waited, and waited, and waited for three whole days and three whole nights; but froggie never came up again, and they had just given him up in despair when his nose showed above the water.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='539'>"No!" says he, with a great gasp.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='540'>"Then what do you want?" they cried in a rage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='541'>"My breath," says froggie, and with that he sinks down again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='542'>Well, they waited two days and two nights more, and at last up comes the little frog with the golden snuff-box in its mouth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='543'>Then they all rejoiced exceedingly, and the eagle flew ever so fast to the palace of the King of the Birds.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='544'>u"But alas and alack-a-day!

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='546'>So before the clock struck eight next morning, there was the Castle on its twelve golden pillars, and the King of the Birds was fine and pleased, and let Jack take his horse and ride to the palace of the King of the Frogs.

At this the little red men were a wee bit cross; but they said they supposed it could not be helped; so, though they yawned, they brought the Castle all right, and Jack was allowed to take his horse and go to the palace of the King of all the Mice in the World. But here the same thing happened, and the little red men tumbled out of the golden snuff-box in a real rage, and said fellows might as well have no sleep at all! However, they did as they were bidden; they brought the Castle of the golden pillars from the palace of the King of the Frogs to the palace of the King of the Birds, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='castle;pillar;palace;king;palace;king;birds;horse;ride;home' adjectives='golden;own' verbs='do;be;bid;bring;be;allow;take'>Jack</entity> was allowed to take his own horse and ride home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='547'>[Illustration: They brought the Castle of the golden pillars]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='548'>u"But the year and a day which he had been allowed was almost gone, and even his gay young wife, after almost weeping her eyes out after her handsome young husband, had given up Jack for lost; so every one was astounded to see him, and not over-pleased either to see him come without his Castle. Indeed his father-in-law swore with many oaths that if it were not in its proper place by eight o"clock next morning <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='father-in-law;oath;place;o;clock;s;life' adjectives='many;proper' verbs='swear;be;be;forfeit'>Jack</entity>"s life should be forfeit."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='549'>Now this, of course, was exactly what Jack had wanted and intended from the beginning; because when death was nigh he could open the golden snuff-box and order about the little red men. But he had opened it so often of late and they had become so cross that he was in a stew what to do; whether to give them time to show their temper, or to hustle them out of it. At last he decided to do half and half. So just as the hands of the clock were at five minutes to eight he opened the box, and stopped his ears!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='550'>u"Well! you never heard such a yawning, and scolding, and threatening, and blustering. What did he mean by it? Why should he take four bites at one cherry? If he was always in fear of death why didn"t he die and have done with it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='551'>In the midst of all this the tower clock began to whirr--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='552'>"Gentlemen!" says <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fear' adjectives='' verbs='say;be;quake;do;be;tell'>Jack</entity>--he was really quaking with fear--"do as you are told."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='553'>"For the last time," they shrieked. "We won\"t stay and serve a master who thinks he is going to die every day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='554'>And with that they flew out of the window.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='555'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='556'>_AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK._</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='557'>The golden snuff-box remained empty for evermore.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='558'>But when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='window;castle;middle;lake;pillar;wife;nightcap;window' adjectives='golden;young;gay' verbs='look;be;be;look'>Jack</entity> looked out of window there was the Castle in the middle of the lake on its twelve golden pillars, and there was his young wife ever so pretty and gay in her nightcap looking out of the window too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='559'>So they lived happily ever after.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='560'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='561'>TATTERCOATS</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='562'>In a great Palace by the sea there once dwelt a very rich old lord, who had neither wife nor children living, only one little granddaughter, whose face he had never seen in all her life. He hated her bitterly, because at her birth his favourite daughter died; and when the old nurse brought him the baby he swore that it might live or die as it liked, but he would never look on its face as long as it lived.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='563'>So he turned his back, and sat by his window looking out over the sea, and weeping great tears for his lost daughter, till his white hair and beard grew down over his shoulders and twined round his chair and crept into the chinks of the floor, and his tears, dropping on to the window-ledge, wore a channel through the stone, and ran away in a little river to the great sea. Meanwhile, his granddaughter grew up with no one to care for her, or clothe her; only the old nurse, when no one was by, would sometimes give her a dish of scraps from the kitchen, or a torn petticoat from the rag-bag; while the other servants of the palace would drive her from the house with blows and mocking words, calling her "Tattercoats," and pointing to her bare feet and shoulders, till she ran away, crying, to hide among the bushes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='564'>So she grew up, with little to eat or to wear, spending her days out of doors, her only companion a crippled gooseherd, who fed his flock of geese on the common. And this gooseherd was a queer, merry little chap, and when she was hungry, or cold, or tired, he would play to her so gaily on his little pipe, that she forgot all her troubles, and would fall to dancing with his flock of noisy geese for partners.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='565'>Now one day people told each other that the King was travelling through the land, and was to give a great ball to all the lords and ladies of the country in the town near by, and that the Prince, his only son, was to choose a wife from amongst the maidens in the company. In due time one of the royal invitations to the ball was brought to the Palace by the sea, and the servants carried it up to the old lord, who still sat by his window, wrapped in his long white hair and weeping into the little river that was fed by his tears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='566'>u"But when he heard the King"s command, he dried his eyes and bade them bring shears to cut him loose, for his hair had bound him a fast prisoner, and he could not move. And then he sent them for rich clothes, and jewels, which he put on; and he ordered them to saddle the white horse, with gold and silk, that he might ride to meet the King; but he quite forgot he had a granddaughter to take to the ball."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='567'>u"Meanwhile Tattercoats sat by the kitchen-door weeping, because she could not go to see the grand doings. And when the old nurse heard her crying she went to the Lord of the Palace, and begged him to take his granddaughter with him to the King"s ball."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='568'>But he only frowned and told her to be silent; while the servants laughed and said, "Tattercoats is happy in her rags, playing with the gooseherd! Let her be--it is all she is fit for."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='569'>A second, and then a third time, the old nurse begged him to let the girl go with him, but she was answered only by black looks and fierce words, till she was driven from the room by the jeering servants, with blows and mocking words.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='570'>u"Weeping over her ill-success, the old nurse went to look for Tattercoats; but the girl had been turned from the door by the cook, and had run away to tell her friend the gooseherd how unhappy she was because she could not go to the King"s ball."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='571'>Now when the gooseherd had listened to her story, he bade her cheer up, and proposed that they should go together into the town to see the King, and all the fine things; and when she looked sorrowfully down at her rags and bare feet he played a note or two upon his pipe, so gay and merry, that she forgot all about her tears and her troubles, and before she well knew, the gooseherd had taken her by the hand, and she and he, and the geese before them, were dancing down the road towards the town.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='572'>"Even cripples can dance when they choose," said the gooseherd.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='573'>Before they had gone very far a handsome young man, splendidly dressed, riding up, stopped to ask the way to the castle where the King was staying, and when he found that they too were going thither, he got off his horse and walked beside them along the road.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='574'>"You seem merry folk," he said, "and will be good company."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='575'>"Good company, indeed," said the gooseherd, and played a new tune that was not a dance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='576'>u"It was a curious tune, and it made the strange young man stare and stare and stare at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tune;man;t;rag;t;truth;anything;face' adjectives='curious;strange;young;beautiful' verbs='be;make;stare;stare;stare;couldn;see;couldn;tell;see'>Tattercoats</entity> till he couldn"t see her rags--till he couldn"t, to tell the truth, see anything but her beautiful face."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='577'>Then he said, "You are the most beautiful maiden in the world. Will you marry me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='578'>Then the gooseherd smiled to himself, and played sweeter than ever.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='579'>But Tattercoats laughed. "Not I," said she; "you would be finely put to shame, and so would I be, if you took a goose-girl for your wife! Go and ask one of the great ladies you will see to-night at the King\"s ball, and do not flout poor Tattercoats."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='580'>u"But the more she refused him the sweeter the pipe played, and the deeper the young man fell in love; till at last he begged her to come that night at twelve to the King"s ball, just as she was, with the gooseherd and his geese, in her torn petticoat and bare feet, and see if he wouldn"t dance with her before the King and the lords and ladies, and present her to them all, as his dear and honoured bride."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='581'>[Illustration: Tattercoats dancing while the gooseherd pipes]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='582'>Now at first <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gooseherd;fortune' adjectives='little' verbs='say;say;take;come'>Tattercoats</entity> said she would not; but the gooseherd said, "Take fortune when it comes, little one."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='583'>So when night came, and the hall in the castle was full of light and music, and the lords and ladies were dancing before the King, just as the clock struck twelve, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hall;castle;light;music;lord;lady;king;clock;gooseherd;flock;goose;head;door;ball-room;side;lady;lord;king;end;amazement' adjectives='full;noisy;great;far' verbs='come;be;be;dance;strike;follow;hiss;sway;enter;walk;whisper;laugh;seat;stare'>Tattercoats</entity> and the gooseherd, followed by his flock of noisy geese, hissing and swaying their heads, entered at the great doors, and walked straight up the ball-room, while on either side the ladies whispered, the lords laughed, and the King seated at the far end stared in amazement.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='584'>u"But as they came in front of the throne Tattercoats" lover rose from beside the King, and came to meet her. Taking her by the hand, he kissed her thrice before them all, and turned to the King."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='585'>"Father!" he said--for it was the Prince himself--"I have made my choice, and here is my bride, the loveliest girl in all the land, and the sweetest as well!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='586'>u"Before he had finished speaking, the gooseherd had put his pipe to his lips and played a few notes that sounded like a bird singing far off in the woods; and as he played Tattercoats" rags were changed to shining robes sewn with glittering jewels, a golden crown lay upon her golden hair, and the flock of geese behind her became a crowd of dainty pages, bearing her long train."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='587'>And as the King rose to greet her as his daughter the trumpets sounded loudly in honour of the new Princess, and the people outside in the street said to each other:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='588'>"Ah! now the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wife;girl;land' adjectives='loveliest' verbs='have;choose'>Prince</entity> has chosen for his wife the loveliest girl in all the land!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='589'>u"But the gooseherd was never seen again, and no one knew what became of him; while the old lord went home once more to his Palace by the sea, for he could not stay at Court, when he had sworn never to look on his granddaughter"s face."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='590'>So there he still sits by his window,--if you could only see him, as you may some day--weeping more bitterly than ever. And his white hair has bound him to the stones, and the river of his tears runs away to the great sea.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='591'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='592'>THE THREE FEATHERS</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='593'>Once upon a time there lived a girl who was wooed and married by a man she never saw; for he came a-courting her after nightfall, and when they were married he never came home till it was dark, and always left before dawn.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='594'>Still he was good and kind to her, giving her everything her heart could desire, so she was well content for a while. But, after a bit, some of her friends, doubtless full of envy for her good luck, began to whisper that the unseen husband must have something dreadful the matter with him which made him averse to being seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='595'>u"Now from the very beginning the girl had wondered why her lover did not come a-courting her as other girls" lovers came, openly and by day, and though, at first, she paid no heed to her neighbours" nods and winks, she began at last to think there might be something in what they said. So she determined to see for herself, and one night when she heard her husband come into her room, she lit her candle suddenly and saw him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='596'>And, lo and behold! he was handsome as handsome; beautiful enough to make every woman in the world fall in love with him on the spot. But even as she got her glimpse of him, he changed into a big brown bird which looked at her with eyes full of anger and blame.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='597'>"Because you have done this faithless thing," it said, "you will see me no more, unless for seven long years and a day you serve for me faithfully."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='598'>And she cried with tears and sobs, "I will serve seven times seven years and a day if you will only come back. Tell me what I am to do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='599'>Then the bird-husband said, "I will place you in service, and there you must remain and do good work for seven years and a day, and you must listen to no man who may seek to beguile you to leave that service. If you do I will never return."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='600'>To this the girl agreed, and the bird, spreading its broad brown wings, carried her to a big mansion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='601'>"Here they need a laundry-maid," said the bird-husband. "Go in, ask to see the mistress, and say you will do the work; but remember you must do it for seven years and a day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='602'>"But I cannot do it for seven days," answered the girl. "I cannot wash or iron."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='603'>"That matters nothing," replied the bird. "All you have to do is to pluck three feathers from under my wing close to my heart, and these feathers will do your bidding whatever it may be. You will only have to put them on your hand, and say, \"By virtue of these three feathers from over my true love\"s heart may this be done,\" and it will be done."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='604'>u"So the girl plucked three feathers from under the bird"s wing, and after that the bird flew away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='605'>Then the girl did as she was bidden, and the lady of the house engaged her for the place. And never was such a quick laundress; for, see you, she had only to go into the wash-house, bolt the door and close the shutters, so that no one should see what she was at; then she would out with the three feathers and say, "By virtue of these three feathers from over my true love\"s heart may the copper be lit, the clothes sorted, washed, boiled, dried, folded, mangled, ironed," and lo! there they came tumbling on to the table, clean and white, quite ready to be put away. So her mistress set great store by her and said there never was such a good laundry-maid. Thus four years passed and there was no talk of her leaving. But the other servants grew jealous of her, all the more so, because, being a very pretty girl, all the men-servants fell in love with her and wanted to marry her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='606'>u"But she would have none of them, because she was always waiting and longing for the day when her bird-husband would come back to her in man"s form."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='607'>Now one of the men who wanted her was the stout butler, and one day as he was coming back from the cider-house he chanced to stop by the laundry, and he heard a voice say, "By virtue of these three feathers from over my true love\"s heart may the copper be lit, the clothes sorted, boiled, dried, folded, mangled, and ironed."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='608'>He thought this very queer, so he peeped through the keyhole. And there was the girl sitting at her ease in a chair, while all the clothes came flying to the table ready and fit to put away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='609'>Well, that night he went to the girl and said that if she turned up her nose at him and his proposal any longer, he would up and tell the mistress that her fine laundress was nothing but a witch; and then, even if she were not burnt alive, she would lose her place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='610'>Now the girl was in great distress what to do, since if she were not faithful to her bird-husband, or if she failed to serve her seven years and a day in one service, he would alike fail to return; so she made an excuse by saying she could think of no one who did not give her enough money to satisfy her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='7'>Once upon a time there was a little chimney-sweep, and his name was Tom.  That is a short name, and you have heard it before, so you will not have much trouble in remembering it.  He lived in a great town in the North country, where there were plenty of chimneys to sweep, and plenty of money for Tom to earn and his master to spend. He could not read nor write, and did not care to do either; and he never washed himself, for there was no water up the court where he lived.  He had never been taught to say his prayers.  He never had heard of God, or of Christ, except in words which you never have heard, and which it would have been well if he had never heard.  He cried half his time, and laughed the other half.  He cried when he had to climb the dark flues, rubbing his poor knees and elbows raw; and when the soot got into his eyes, which it did every day in the week; and when his master beat him, which he did every day in the week; and when he had not enough to eat, which happened every day in the week likewise.  And he laughed the other half of the day, when he was tossing halfpennies with the other boys, or playing leap-frog over the posts, or bowling stones at the horses" legs as they trotted by, which last was excellent fun, when there was a wall at hand behind which to hide.  As for chimney-sweeping, and being hungry, and being beaten, he took all that for the way of the world, like the rain and snow and thunder, and stood manfully with his back to it till it was over, as his old donkey did to a hail- storm; and then shook his ears and was as jolly as ever; and thought of the fine times coming, when he would be a man, and a master sweep, and sit in the public-house with a quart of beer and a long pipe, and play cards for silver money, and wear velveteens and ankle-jacks, and keep a white bull-dog with one gray ear, and carry her puppies in his pocket, just like a man.  And he would have apprentices, one, two, three, if he could.  How he would bully them, and knock them about, just as his master did to him; and make them carry home the soot sacks, while he rode before them on his donkey, with a pipe in his mouth and a flower in his button-hole, like a king at the head of his army.  Yes, there were good times coming; and, when his master let him have a pull at the leavings of his beer, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='town;pull;leavings;boy;beer;master;time' adjectives='jolliest;good;whole' verbs='be;let;come;have' valence='5.92' arousal='3.765' dominance='5.64'>Tom</entity> was the jolliest boy in the whole town.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='8'>One day a smart little groom rode into the court where Tom lived. Tom was just hiding behind a wall, to heave half a brick at his horse"s legs, as is the custom of that country when they welcome strangers; but the groom saw him, and halloed to him to know where Mr. Grimes, the chimney-sweep, lived.  Now, Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='customer;business;s;half-brick;mr.;master;order;man' adjectives='civil;good;own' verbs='put;be;proceed;take' valence='5.668' arousal='3.816' dominance='5.5'>Grimes</entity> was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='customer;business;s;half-brick;mr.;master;order;man' adjectives='civil;good;own' verbs='put;be;proceed;take' valence='5.668' arousal='3.816' dominance='5.5'>Tom</entity>"s own master, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='customer;business;s;half-brick;mr.;master;order;man' adjectives='civil;good;own' verbs='put;be;proceed;take' valence='5.668' arousal='3.816' dominance='5.5'>Tom</entity> was a good man of business, and always civil to customers, so he put the half-brick down quietly behind <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='customer;business;s;half-brick;mr.;master;order;man' adjectives='civil;good;own' verbs='put;be;proceed;take' valence='5.668' arousal='3.816' dominance='5.5'>the wall</entity>, and proceeded to take orders.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='9'>Mr. Grimes was to come up next morning to Sir John Harthover"s, at the Place, for his old chimney-sweep was gone to prison, and the chimneys wanted sweeping.  And so he rode away, not giving Tom time to ask what the sweep had gone to prison for, which was a matter of interest to Tom, as he had been in prison once or twice himself. Moreover, the groom looked so very neat and clean, with his drab gaiters, drab breeches, drab jacket, snow-white tie with a smart pin in it, and clean round ruddy face, that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='truce;fellow;business;pin;people;groom;appearance;breeches;jacket;flag;ruddy;half;gaiter;tie;brick;face;round;clothes' adjectives='stuck-up;other;neat;clean;drab;smart;snow-white' verbs='be;look;do;give;pay;remember;air;go;have;wear;disgust;offend;come;fetch;consider' valence='5.7197826087' arousal='3.65586956522' dominance='5.54608695652'>Tom</entity> was offended and disgusted at his appearance, and considered him a stuck-up fellow, who gave himself airs because he wore smart clothes, and other people paid for them; and went behind <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='truce;fellow;business;pin;people;groom;appearance;breeches;jacket;flag;ruddy;half;gaiter;tie;brick;face;round;clothes' adjectives='stuck-up;other;neat;clean;drab;smart;snow-white' verbs='be;look;do;give;pay;remember;air;go;have;wear;disgust;offend;come;fetch;consider' valence='5.7197826087' arousal='3.65586956522' dominance='5.54608695652'>the wall</entity> to fetch the half- brick after all; but did not, remembering that he had come in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='truce;fellow;business;pin;people;groom;appearance;breeches;jacket;flag;ruddy;half;gaiter;tie;brick;face;round;clothes' adjectives='stuck-up;other;neat;clean;drab;smart;snow-white' verbs='be;look;do;give;pay;remember;air;go;have;wear;disgust;offend;come;fetch;consider' valence='5.7197826087' arousal='3.65586956522' dominance='5.54608695652'>the way</entity> of business, and was, as it were, under a flag of truce.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='10'>His master was so delighted at his new customer that he knocked Tom down out of hand, and drank more beer that night than he usually did in two, in order to be sure of getting up in time next morning; for the more a man"s head aches when he wakes, the more glad he is to turn out, and have a breath of fresh air.  And, when he did get up at four the next morning, he knocked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boy;school;house;gentleman;satisfaction;thing;order' adjectives='great;good;extra;young;public' verbs='be;use;give;do;make;get;knock;go;teach' valence='6.225' arousal='3.8825' dominance='5.72125'>Tom</entity> down again, in order to teach him (as young gentlemen used to be taught at public schools) that he must be an extra good boy that day, as they were going to a very great house, and might make a very good thing of it, if they could but give satisfaction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='11'>And Tom thought so likewise, and, indeed, would have done and behaved his best, even without being knocked down.  For, of all places upon earth, Harthover Place (which he had never seen) was the most wonderful, and, of all men on earth, Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;gaol;place;earth;harthover;man' adjectives='awful;wonderful' verbs='be;see;send;have' valence='5.92823529412' arousal='3.96' dominance='5.69647058824'>John</entity> (whom he had seen, having been sent to gaol by him twice) was the most awful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='12'>Harthover Place was really a grand place, even for the rich North country; with a house so large that in the frame-breaking riots, which Tom could just remember, the Duke of Wellington, and ten thousand soldiers to match, were easily housed therein; at least, so Tom believed; with a park full of deer, which Tom believed to be monsters who were in the habit of eating children; with miles of game-preserves, in which Mr. Grimes and the collier lads poached at times, on which occasions Tom saw pheasants, and wondered what they tasted like; with a noble salmon-river, in which Mr. Grimes and his friends would have liked to poach; but then they must have got into cold water, and that they did not like at all.  In short, Harthover was a grand place, and Sir John a grand old man, whom even Mr. Grimes respected; for not only could he send Mr. Grimes to prison when he deserved it, as he did once or twice a week; not only did he own all the land about for miles; not only was he a jolly, honest, sensible squire, as ever kept a pack of hounds, who would do what he thought right by his neighbours, as well as get what he thought right for himself; but, what was more, he weighed full fifteen stone, was nobody knew how many inches round the chest, and could have thrashed Mr. Grimes himself in fair fight, which very few folk round there could do, and which, my dear little boy, would not have been right for him to do, as a great many things are not which one both can do, and would like very much to do.  So Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;lass;pheasant;hat;chap;s;mr.;country;awd;lady;compliment' adjectives='buirdly;high;north;young;properly-inspected' verbs='be;poach;ride;perceive;call;have;touch;think;make' valence='5.79034482759' arousal='3.96793103448' dominance='5.58034482759'>Grimes</entity> touched his hat to him when he rode through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sir;lass;pheasant;hat;chap;s;mr.;country;awd;lady;compliment' adjectives='buirdly;high;north;young;properly-inspected' verbs='be;poach;ride;perceive;call;have;touch;think;make' valence='5.79034482759' arousal='3.96793103448' dominance='5.58034482759'>the town</entity>, and called him a "buirdly awd chap," and his young ladies "gradely lasses," which are two high compliments in the North country; and thought that that made up for his poaching Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;lass;pheasant;hat;chap;s;mr.;country;awd;lady;compliment' adjectives='buirdly;high;north;young;properly-inspected' verbs='be;poach;ride;perceive;call;have;touch;think;make' valence='5.79034482759' arousal='3.96793103448' dominance='5.58034482759'>John</entity>"s pheasants; whereby you may perceive that Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sir;lass;pheasant;hat;chap;s;mr.;country;awd;lady;compliment' adjectives='buirdly;high;north;young;properly-inspected' verbs='be;poach;ride;perceive;call;have;touch;think;make' valence='5.79034482759' arousal='3.96793103448' dominance='5.58034482759'>Grimes</entity> had not been to a properly-inspected Government National School.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='13'>Now, I dare say, you never got up at three o"clock on a midsummer morning.

But, I assure you, that three o"clock on a midsummer morning is the pleasantest time of all the twenty-four hours, and all the three hundred and sixty-five days; and why every one does not get up then, I never could tell, save that they are all determined to spoil their nerves and their complexions by doing all night what they might just as well do all day.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>Tom had never seen the like.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='78'>The room was all dressed in white,--white window-curtains, white bed-curtains, white furniture, and white walls, with just a few lines of pink here and there.  The carpet was all over gay little flowers; and the walls were hung with pictures in gilt frames, which amused Tom very much.  There were pictures of ladies and gentlemen, and pictures of horses and dogs.  The horses he liked; but the dogs he did not care for much, for there were no bull-dogs among them, not even a terrier.  But the two pictures which took his fancy most were, one a man in long garments, with little children and their mothers round him, who was laying his hand upon the children"s heads.  That was a very pretty picture, Tom thought, to hang in a lady"s room.  For he could see that it was a lady"s room by the dresses which lay about.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='79'>The other picture was that of a man nailed to a cross, which surprised Tom much.  He fancied that he had seen something like it in a shop-window.  But why was it there?  "Poor man," thought Tom, "and he looks so kind and quiet.  But why should the lady have such a sad picture as that in her room?  Perhaps it was some kinsman of hers, who had been murdered by the savages in foreign parts, and she kept it there for a remembrance."

Her cheeks were almost as white as the pillow, and her hair was like threads of gold spread all about over the bed.  She might have been as old as Tom, or maybe a year or two older; but Tom did not think of that. He thought only of her delicate skin and golden hair, and wondered whether she was a real live person, or one of the wax dolls he had seen in the shops.  But when he saw her breathe, he made up his mind that she was alive, and stood staring at her, as if she had been an angel out of heaven.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>And when he opened his eyes (for he shut them very tight) it was only an old cock-grouse, who had been washing himself in sand, like an Arab, for want of water; and who, when Tom had all but trodden on him, jumped up with a noise like the express train, leaving his wife and children to shift for themselves, like an old coward, and went off, screaming "Cur-ru-u-uck, cur-ru-u-uck--murder, thieves, fire--cur-u-uck-cock-kick--the end of the world is come--kick-kick- cock-kick."  He was always fancying that the end of the world was come, when anything happened which was farther off than the end of his own nose.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>So the old grouse came back to his wife and family an hour afterwards, and said solemnly, "Cock-cock-kick; my dears, the end of the world is not quite come; but I assure you it is coming the day after to-morrow--cock."  But his wife had heard that so often that she knew all about it, and a little more.  And, besides, she was the mother of a family, and had seven little poults to wash and feed every day; and that made her very practical, and a little sharp-tempered; so all she answered was:  "Kick-kick-kick--go and catch spiders, go and catch spiders--kick."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='110'>So Tom went on and on, he hardly knew why; but he liked the great wide strange place, and the cool fresh bracing air.  But he went more and more slowly as he got higher up the hill; for now the ground grew very bad indeed.  Instead of soft turf and springy heather, he met great patches of flat limestone rock, just like ill-made pavements, with deep cracks between the stones and ledges, filled with ferns; so he had to hop from stone to stone, and now and then he slipped in between, and hurt his little bare toes, though they were tolerably tough ones; but still he would go on and up, he could not tell why.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='112'>And now he began to get a little hungry, and very thirsty; for he had run a long way, and the sun had risen high in heaven, and the rock was as hot as an oven, and the air danced reels over it, as it does over a limekiln, till everything round seemed quivering and melting in the glare.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>But he could see nothing to eat anywhere, and still less to drink.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>The heath was full of bilberries and whimberries; but they were only in flower yet, for it was June.  And as for water; who can find that on the top of a limestone rock?  Now and then he passed by a deep dark swallow-hole, going down into the earth, as if it was the chimney of some dwarfs house underground; and more than once, as he passed, he could hear water falling, trickling, tinkling, many many feet below.  How he longed to get down to it, and cool his poor baked lips!  But, brave little chimney-sweep as he was, he dared not climb down such chimneys as those.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='136'>So Tom went to go down; and first he went down three hundred feet of steep heather, mixed up with loose brown grindstone, as rough as a file; which was not pleasant to his poor little heels, as he came bump, stump, jump, down the steep.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='137'>Then he went down three hundred feet of lime-stone terraces, one below the other, as straight as if a carpenter had ruled them with his ruler and then cut them out with his chisel.  There was no heath there, but -</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='143'>Then another step of stone, ten feet high; and there he had to stop himself, and crawl along the edge to find a crack; for if he had rolled over, he would have rolled right into the old woman"s garden, and frightened her out of her wits.</paragraph>

I wish it was all over; and so did he.  And yet he thought he could throw a stone into the old woman"s garden.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='145'>At last he came to a bank of beautiful shrubs; white-beam with its great silver-backed leaves, and mountain-ash, and oak; and below them cliff and crag, cliff and crag, with great beds of crown-ferns and wood-sedge; while through the shrubs he could see the stream sparkling, and hear it murmur on the white pebbles.  He did not know that it was three hundred feet below.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='146'>You would have been giddy, perhaps, at looking down:  but Tom was not.  He was a brave little chimney-sweep; and when he found himself on the top of a high cliff, instead of sitting down and crying for his baba (though he never had had any baba to cry for), he said, "Ah, this will just suit me!" though he was very tired; and down he went, by stock and stone, sedge and ledge, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rush;sedge;stone;hand;ledge;stock;ape' adjectives='little;black;tired' verbs='go;be;bear;have' valence='5.62947368421' arousal='4.07421052632' dominance='5.47052631579'>bush</entity> and rush, as if he had been born a jolly little black ape, with four hands instead of two.</paragraph>

The burning sun on the fells had sucked him up; but the damp heat of the woody crag sucked him up still more; and the perspiration ran out of the ends of his fingers and toes, and washed him cleaner than he had been for a whole year.  But, of course, he dirtied everything, terribly as he went.  There has been a great black smudge all down the crag ever since.

But it is a wide world, my little man--and thank Heaven for it, for else, between crinolines and theories, some of us would get squashed--and plenty of room in it for fairies, without people seeing them; unless, of course, they look in the right place.  The most wonderful and the strongest things in the world, you know, are just the things which no one can see.  There is life in you; and it is the life in you which makes you grow, and move, and think:  and yet you can"t see it.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='247'>You must not say that this cannot be, or that that is contrary to nature.  You do not know what Nature is, or what she can do; and nobody knows; not even Sir Roderick Murchison, or Professor Owen, or Professor Sedgwick, or Professor Huxley, or Mr. Darwin, or Professor Faraday, or Mr. Grove, or any other of the great men whom good boys are taught to respect.  They are very wise men; and you must listen respectfully to all they say:  but even if they should say, which I am sure they never would, "That cannot exist.  That is contrary to nature," you must wait a little, and see; for perhaps even they may be wrong.  It is only children who read Aunt Agitate"s Arguments, or Cousin Cramchild"s Conversations; or lads who go to popular lectures, and see a man pointing at a few big ugly pictures on the wall, or making nasty smells with bottles and squirts, for an hour or two, and calling that anatomy or chemistry- -who talk about "cannot exist," and "contrary to nature."  Wise men are afraid to say that there is anything contrary to nature, except what is contrary to mathematical truth; for two and two cannot make five, and two straight lines cannot join twice, and a part cannot be as great as the whole, and so on (at least, so it seems at present):  but the wiser men are, the less they talk about "cannot."  That is a very rash, dangerous word, that "cannot"; and if people use it too often, the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;people;thunder;fairies;flea;trouble;cloud' adjectives='dangerous;apt;much;rash;other;more' verbs='be;use;show;bite;say;astonish;approve;make;take' valence='5.39464285714' arousal='4.04821428571' dominance='5.51857142857'>Queen</entity> of all the Fairies, who makes the clouds thunder and the fleas bite, and takes just as much trouble about one as about the other, is apt to astonish them suddenly by showing them, that though they say she cannot, yet she can, and what is more, will, whether they approve or not.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='248'>And therefore it is, that there are dozens and hundreds of things in the world which we should certainly have said were contrary to nature, if we did not see them going on under our eyes all day long.  If people had never seen little seeds grow into great plants and trees, of quite different shape from themselves, and these trees again produce fresh seeds, to grow into fresh trees, they would have said, "The thing cannot be; it is contrary to nature." And they would have been quite as right in saying so, as in saying that most other things cannot be.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='249'>Or suppose again, that you had come, like M. Du Chaillu, a traveller from unknown parts; and that no human being had ever seen or heard of an elephant.  And suppose that you described him to people, and said, "This is the shape, and plan, and anatomy of the beast, and of his feet, and of his trunk, and of his grinders, and of his tusks, though they are not tusks at all, but two fore teeth run mad; and this is the section of his skull, more like a mushroom than a reasonable skull of a reasonable or unreasonable beast; and so forth, and so forth; and though the beast (which I assure you I have seen and shot) is first cousin to the little hairy coney of Scripture, second cousin to a pig, and (I suspect) thirteenth or fourteenth cousin to a rabbit, yet he is the wisest of all beasts, and can do everything save read, write, and cast accounts."  People would surely have said, "Nonsense; your elephant is contrary to nature;" and have thought you were telling stories--as the French thought of Le Vaillant when he came back to Paris and said that he had shot a giraffe; and as the king of the Cannibal Islands thought of the English sailor, when he said that in his country water turned to marble, and rain fell as feathers.  They would tell you, the more they knew of science, "Your elephant is an impossible monster, contrary to the laws of comparative anatomy, as far as yet known."  To which you would answer the less, the more you thought.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='250'>Did not learned men, too, hold, till within the last twenty-five years, that a flying dragon was an impossible monster?  And do we not now know that there are hundreds of them found fossil up and down the world?  People call them Pterodactyles:  but that is only because they are ashamed to call them flying dragons, after denying so long that flying dragons could exist.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='251'>The truth is, that folks" fancy that such and such things cannot be, simply because they have not seen them, is worth no more than a savage"s fancy that there cannot be such a thing as a locomotive, because he never saw one running wild in the forest.  Wise men know that their business is to examine what is, and not to settle what is not.  They know that there are elephants; they know that there have been flying dragons; and the wiser they are, the less inclined they will be to say positively that there are no water-babies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='252'>No water-babies, indeed?  Why, wise men of old said that everything on earth had its double in the water; and you may see that that is, if not quite true, still quite as true as most other theories which you are likely to hear for many a day.  There are land-babies--then why not water-babies?  Are there not water-rats, water-flies, water-crickets, water-crabs, water-tortoises, water-scorpions, water-tigers and water-hogs, water-cats and water-dogs, sea-lions and sea-bears, sea-horses and sea-elephants, sea-mice and sea- urchins, sea-razors and sea-pens, sea-combs and sea-fans; and of plants, are there not water-grass, and water-crowfoot, water- milfoil, and so on, without end?</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='256'>If he says that it is too strange a transformation for a land-baby to turn into a water-baby, ask him if he ever heard of the transformation of Syllis, or the Distomas, or the common jelly- fish, of which M.

Yet the history of the jelly-fish is quite as wonderful as that would be."  Ask him if he knows about all this; and if he does not, tell him to go and look for himself; and advise him (very respectfully, of course) to settle no more what strange things cannot happen, till he has seen what strange things do happen every day.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='258'>And, lastly, if he says (as he most certainly will) that these transformations only take place in the lower animals, and not in the higher, say that that seems to little boys, and to some grown people, a very strange fancy.  For if the changes of the lower animals are so wonderful, and so difficult to discover, why should not there be changes in the higher animals far more wonderful, and far more difficult to discover?  And may not man, the crown and flower of all things, undergo some change as much more wonderful than all the rest, as the Great Exhibition is more wonderful than a rabbit-burrow?  Let him answer that.  And if he says (as he will) that not having seen such a change in his experience, he is not bound to believe it, ask him respectfully, where his microscope has been?  Does not each of us, in coming into this world, go through a transformation just as wonderful as that of a sea-egg, or a butterfly? and do not reason and analogy, as well as Scripture, tell us that that transformation is not the last? and that, though what we shall be, we know not, yet we are here but as the crawling caterpillar, and shall be hereafter as the perfect fly.  The old Greeks, heathens as they were, saw as much as that two thousand years ago; and I care very little for Cousin Cramchild, if he sees even less than they.  And so forth, and so forth, till he is quite cross.  And then tell him that if there are no water-babies, at least there ought to be; and that, at least, he cannot answer.</paragraph>

For he went downward into the water:  but we, I hope, shall go upward to a very different place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='287'>But Tom was very happy in the water.  He had been sadly overworked in the land-world; and so now, to make up for that, he had nothing but holidays in the water-world for a long, long time to come.  He had nothing to do now but enjoy himself, and look at all the pretty things which are to be seen in the cool clear water-world, where the sun is never too hot, and the frost is never too cold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='288'>And what did he live on?  Water-cresses, perhaps; or perhaps water- gruel, and water-milk; too many land-babies do so likewise.  But we do not know what one-tenth of the water-things eat; so we are not answerable for the water-babies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='289'>Sometimes he went along the smooth gravel water-ways, looking at the crickets which ran in and out among the stones, as rabbits do on land; or he climbed over the ledges of rock, and saw the sand- pipes hanging in thousands, with every one of them a pretty little head and legs peeping out; or he went into a still corner, and watched the caddises eating dead sticks as greedily as you would eat plum-pudding, and building their houses with silk and glue. Very fanciful ladies they were; none of them would keep to the same materials for a day.  One would begin with some pebbles; then she would stick on a piece of green wood; then she found a shell, and stuck it on too; and the poor shell was alive, and did not like at all being taken to build houses with:  but the caddis did not let him have any voice in the matter, being rude and selfish, as vain people are apt to be; then she stuck on a piece of rotten wood, then a very smart pink stone, and so on, till she was patched all over like an Irishman"s coat.  Then she found a long straw, five times as long as herself, and said, "Hurrah! my sister has a tail, and I"ll have one too;" and she stuck it on her back, and marched about with it quite proud, though it was very inconvenient indeed. And, at that, tails became all the fashion among the caddis-baits in that pool, as they were at the end of the Long Pond last May, and they all toddled about with long straws sticking out behind, getting between each other"s legs, and tumbling over each other, and looking so ridiculous, that Tom laughed at them till he cried, as we did.  But they were quite right, you know; for people must always follow the fashion, even if it be spoon-bonnets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='290'>Then sometimes he came to a deep still reach; and there he saw the water-forests.  They would have looked to you only little weeds: but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;minnow;weed;everything;microscope;time;water-creature' adjectives='big;little' verbs='do;look;be;see;have;catch;remember' valence='5.7788' arousal='3.9348' dominance='5.5888'>Tom</entity>, you must remember, was so little that everything looked a hundred times as big to him as it does to you, just as things do to a minnow, who sees and catches the little water-creatures which you can only see in a microscope.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='291'>And in the water-forest he saw the water-monkeys and water- squirrels (they had all six legs, though; everything almost has six legs in the water, except efts and water-babies); and nimbly enough they ran among the branches.  There were water-flowers there too, in thousands; and Tom tried to pick them:  but as soon as he touched them, they drew themselves in and turned into knots of jelly; and then Tom saw that they were all alive--bells, and stars, and wheels, and flowers, of all beautiful shapes and colours; and all alive and busy, just as Tom was.  So now he found that there was a great deal more in the world than he had fancied at first sight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='292'>There was one wonderful little fellow, too, who peeped out of the top of a house built of round bricks.  He had two big wheels, and one little one, all over teeth, spinning round and round like the wheels in a thrashing-machine; and Tom stood and stared at him, to see what he was going to make with his machinery.  And what do you think he was doing?  Brick-making.  With his two big wheels he swept together all the mud which floated in the water:  all that was nice in it he put into his stomach and ate; and all the mud he put into the little wheel on his breast, which really was a round hole set with teeth; and there he spun it into a neat hard round brick; and then he took it and stuck it on the top of his house- wall, and set to work to make another. Now was not he a clever little fellow?</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='294'>Now you must know that all the things under the water talk; only not such a language as ours; but such as horses, and dogs, and cows, and birds talk to each other; and Tom soon learned to understand them and talk to them; so that he might have had very pleasant company if he had only been a good boy.  But I am sorry to say, he was too like some other little boys, very fond of hunting and tormenting creatures for mere sport.  Some people say that boys cannot help it; that it is nature, and only a proof that we are all originally descended from beasts of prey.  But whether it is nature or not, little boys can help it, and must help it.  For if they have naughty, low, mischievous tricks in their nature, as monkeys have, that is no reason why they should give way to those tricks like monkeys, who know no better.  And therefore they must not torment dumb creatures; for if they do, a certain old lady who is coming will surely give them exactly what they deserve.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='296'>The water-fairies, of course, were very sorry to see him so unhappy, and longed to take him, and tell him how naughty he was, and teach him to be good, and to play and romp with him too:  but they had been forbidden to do that.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sound;heart;kind;yearning;experience;person;while;longing;lesson' adjectives='sharp;foolish;many' verbs='do;be;teach;have;learn' valence='6.06777777778' arousal='3.96666666667' dominance='5.90722222222'>Tom</entity> had to learn his lesson for himself by sound and sharp experience, as many another foolish person has to do, though there may be many a kind heart yearning over them all the while, and longing to teach them what they can only teach themselves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='297'>At last one day he found a caddis, and wanted it to peep out of its house:  but its house-door was shut.  He had never seen a caddis with a house-door before:  so what must he do, the meddlesome little fellow, but pull it open, to see what the poor lady was doing inside.  What a shame!  How should you like to have any one breaking your bedroom-door in, to see how you looked when you where in bed?  So Tom broke to pieces the door, which was the prettiest little grating of silk, stuck all over with shining bits of crystal; and when he looked in, the caddis poked out her head, and it had turned into just the shape of a bird"s.  But when Tom spoke to her she could not answer; for her mouth and face were tight tied up in a new night-cap of neat pink skin.  However, if she didn"t answer, all the other caddises did; for they held up their hands and shrieked like the cats in Struwelpeter:  "Oh, you nasty horrid boy; there you are at it again!  And she had just laid herself up for a fortnight"s sleep, and then she would have come out with such beautiful wings, and flown about, and laid such lots of eggs:  and now you have broken her door, and she can"t mend it because her mouth is tied up for a fortnight, and she will die.  Who sent you here to worry us out of our lives?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='298'>So Tom swam away.  He was very much ashamed of himself, and felt all the naughtier; as little boys do when they have done wrong and won"t say so.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='299'>Then he came to a pool full of little trout, and began tormenting them, and trying to catch them:  but they slipped through his fingers, and jumped clean out of water in their fright.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='300'>Then he went on sulky and lonely, as he deserved to be; and under a bank he saw a very ugly dirty creature sitting, about half as big as himself; which had six legs, and a big stomach, and a most ridiculous head with two great eyes and a face just like a donkey"s.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='301'>"Oh," said Tom, "you are an ugly fellow to be sure!" and he began making faces at him; and put his nose close to him, and halloed at him, like a very rude boy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='302'>When, hey presto; all the thing"s donkey-face came off in a moment, and out popped a long arm with a pair of pincers at the end of it, and caught Tom by the nose.  It did not hurt him much; but it held him quite tight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='303'>"Yah, ah!  Oh, let me go!" cried <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='cry' valence='3.22' arousal='5.45' dominance='2.56'>Tom</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='308'>Tom stood still, and watched him.  And he swelled himself, and puffed, and stretched himself out stiff, and at last--crack, puff, bang--he opened all down his back, and then up to the top of his head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='309'>And out of his inside came the most slender, elegant, soft creature, as soft and smooth as Tom:  but very pale and weak, like a little child who has been ill a long time in a dark room.  It moved its legs very feebly; and looked about it half ashamed, like a girl when she goes for the first time into a ballroom; and then it began walking slowly up a grass stem to the top of the water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>Tom was so astonished that he never said a word but he stared with all his eyes.  And he went up to the top of the water too, and peeped out to see what would happen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='311'>And as the creature sat in the warm bright sun, a wonderful change came over it.  It grew strong and firm; the most lovely colours began to show on its body, blue and yellow and black, spots and bars and rings; out of its back rose four great wings of bright brown gauze; and its eyes grew so large that they filled all its head, and shone like ten thousand diamonds.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='312'>"Oh, you beautiful creature!" said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hand' adjectives='' verbs='put;catch;say' valence='5.635' arousal='4.0675' dominance='6.0425'>Tom</entity>; and he put out his hand to catch it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='314'>"No!" it said, "you cannot catch me.

Hurrah!"  And he flew away into the air, and began catching gnats.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='315'>"Oh! come back, come back," cried Tom, "you beautiful creature.  I have no one to play with, and I am so lonely here.  If you will but come back I will never try to catch you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='316'>"I don"t care whether you do or not," said the dragon-fly; "for you can"t.  But when I have had my dinner, and looked a little about this pretty place, I will come back, and have a little chat about all I have seen in my travels.  Why, what a huge tree this is! and what huge leaves on it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='317'>It was only a big dock:  but you know the dragon-fly had never seen any but little water-trees; starwort, and milfoil, and water- crowfoot, and such like; so it did look very big to him.  Besides, he was very short-sighted, as all dragon-flies are; and never could see a yard before his nose; any more than a great many other folks, who are not half as handsome as he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='318'>The dragon-fly did come back, and chatted away with Tom.  He was a little conceited about his fine colours and his large wings; but you know, he had been a poor dirty ugly creature all his life before; so there were great excuses for him.  He was very fond of talking about all the wonderful things he saw in the trees and the meadows; and Tom liked to listen to him, for he had forgotten all about them.  So in a little while they became great friends.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='319'>And I am very glad to say, that Tom learned such a lesson that day, that he did not torment creatures for a long time after.

He liked most, though, to see them rising at the flies, as they sailed round and round under the shadow of the great oak, where the beetles fell flop into the water, and the green caterpillars let themselves down from the boughs by silk ropes for no reason at all; and then changed their foolish minds for no reason at all either; and hauled themselves up again into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fly;rope;ball;neck;paw;mind;bough;flop;oak;reason;living;water;trick;caterpillar;trouble;beetle;rope-dancer;shadow;silk;round;string' adjectives='clever;great;foolish;green;much' verbs='be;sail;like;do;s;rise;haul;tell;try;see;let;take;fall;break;get;roll;change' valence='5.61826923077' arousal='3.93076923077' dominance='5.47961538462'>the tree</entity>, rolling up the rope in a ball between their paws; which is a very clever rope-dancer"s trick, and neither <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fly;rope;ball;neck;paw;mind;bough;flop;oak;reason;living;water;trick;caterpillar;trouble;beetle;rope-dancer;shadow;silk;round;string' adjectives='clever;great;foolish;green;much' verbs='be;sail;like;do;s;rise;haul;tell;try;see;let;take;fall;break;get;roll;change' valence='5.61826923077' arousal='3.93076923077' dominance='5.47961538462'>Blondin</entity> nor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fly;rope;ball;neck;paw;mind;bough;flop;oak;reason;living;water;trick;caterpillar;trouble;beetle;rope-dancer;shadow;silk;round;string' adjectives='clever;great;foolish;green;much' verbs='be;sail;like;do;s;rise;haul;tell;try;see;let;take;fall;break;get;roll;change' valence='5.61826923077' arousal='3.93076923077' dominance='5.47961538462'>Leotard</entity> could do it:  but why they should take so much trouble about it no one can tell; for they cannot get their living, as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fly;rope;ball;neck;paw;mind;bough;flop;oak;reason;living;water;trick;caterpillar;trouble;beetle;rope-dancer;shadow;silk;round;string' adjectives='clever;great;foolish;green;much' verbs='be;sail;like;do;s;rise;haul;tell;try;see;let;take;fall;break;get;roll;change' valence='5.61826923077' arousal='3.93076923077' dominance='5.47961538462'>Blondin</entity> and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fly;rope;ball;neck;paw;mind;bough;flop;oak;reason;living;water;trick;caterpillar;trouble;beetle;rope-dancer;shadow;silk;round;string' adjectives='clever;great;foolish;green;much' verbs='be;sail;like;do;s;rise;haul;tell;try;see;let;take;fall;break;get;roll;change' valence='5.61826923077' arousal='3.93076923077' dominance='5.47961538462'>Leotard</entity> do, by trying to break their necks on a string.</paragraph>

He could not tell why; but the more he thought, the more he grew discontented with the narrow little stream in which he lived, and all his companions there; and wanted to get out into the wide wide world, and enjoy all the wonderful sights of which he was sure it was full.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='370'>And once he set off to go down the stream.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='377'>And now, by the flashes of the lightning, Tom saw a new sight--all the bottom of the stream alive with great eels, turning and twisting along, all down stream and away.

So at last he came up to the top, and sat upon a little point of rock, and looked up at the broad yellow moon, and wondered what she was, and thought that she looked at him.  And he watched the moonlight on the rippling river, and the black heads of the firs, and the silver-frosted lawns, and listened to the owl"s hoot, and the snipe"s bleat, and the fox"s bark, and the otter"s laugh; and smelt the soft perfume of the birches, and the wafts of heather honey off the grouse moor far above; and felt very happy, though he could not well tell why.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='458'>So he went very carefully, peeping round all the rocks, and hiding under all the roots.  Mr. Grimes lay there still; he had not turned into a water-baby.  In the afternoon Tom went back again.  He could not rest till he had found out what had become of Mr. Grimes.  But this time Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mr.;mind;time' adjectives='water-baby' verbs='go;be;make;turn' valence='5.94' arousal='4.04125' dominance='5.485'>Grimes</entity> was gone; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mr.;mind;time' adjectives='water-baby' verbs='go;be;make;turn' valence='5.94' arousal='4.04125' dominance='5.485'>Tom</entity> made up his mind that he was turned into a water-baby.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='459'>He might have made himself easy, poor little man; Mr. Grimes did not turn into a water-baby, or anything like one at all.  But he did not make himself easy; and a long time he was fearful lest he should meet Grimes suddenly in some deep pool.  He could not know that the fairies had carried him away, and put him, where they put everything which falls into the water, exactly where it ought to be.  But, do you know, what had happened to Mr. Grimes had such an effect on him that he never poached salmon any more.  And it is quite certain that, when a man becomes a confirmed poacher, the only way to cure him is to put him under water for twenty-four hours, like Grimes.  So when you grow to be a big man, do you behave as all honest fellows should; and never touch a fish or a head of game which belongs to another man without his express leave; and then people will call you a gentleman, and treat you like one; and perhaps give you good sport:  instead of hitting you into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;people;fish;gentleman;fellow;leave;game;snob;sport;man' adjectives='big;good;express;honest' verbs='be;give;do;poach;belong;behave;call;treat;touch;hit;grow' valence='5.98514285714' arousal='4.14828571429' dominance='5.73628571429'>the river</entity>, or calling you a poaching snob.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>Then Tom went on down, for he was afraid of staying near Grimes: and as he went, all the vale looked sad.  The red and yellow leaves showered down into the river; the flies and beetles were all dead and gone; the chill autumn fog lay low upon the hills, and sometimes spread itself so thickly on the river that he could not see his way.  But he felt his way instead, following the flow of the stream, day after day, past great bridges, past boats and barges, past the great town, with its wharfs, and mills, and tall smoking chimneys, and ships which rode at anchor in the stream; and now and then he ran against their hawsers, and wondered what they were, and peeped out, and saw the sailors lounging on board smoking their pipes; and ducked under again, for he was terribly afraid of being caught by man and turned into a chimney-sweep once more.  He did not know that the fairies were close to him always, shutting the sailors" eyes lest they should see him, and turning him aside from millraces, and sewer-mouths, and all foul and dangerous things.  Poor little fellow, it was a dreary journey for him; and more than once he longed to be back in Vendale, playing with the trout in the bright summer sun.  But it could not be.  What has been once can never come over again.  And people can be little babies, even water-babies, only once in their lives.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='461'>Besides, people who make up their minds to go and see the world, as Tom did, must needs find it a weary journey.  Lucky for them if they do not lose heart and stop half-way, instead of going on bravely to the end as Tom did.  For then they will remain neither boys nor men, neither fish, flesh, nor good red-herring:  having learnt a great deal too much, and yet not enough; and sown their wild oats, without having the advantage of reaping them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='462'>But Tom was always a brave, determined, little English bull-dog, who never knew when he was beaten; and on and on he held, till he saw a long way off the red buoy through the fog.  And then he found to his surprise, <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='surprise;round' adjectives='' verbs='turn;run;find' valence='6.44333333333' arousal='4.32333333333' dominance='5.50833333333'>the stream</entity> turned round, and running up inland.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>It was the tide, of course:  but Tom knew nothing of the tide.  He only knew that in a minute more the water, which had been fresh, turned salt all round him.  And then there came a change over him. He felt as strong, and light, and fresh, as if his veins had run champagne; and gave, he did not know why, three skips out of the water, a yard high, and head over heels, just as the salmon do when they first touch the noble rich salt water, which, as some wise men tell us, is the mother of all living things.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='464'>He did not care now for the tide being against him.  The red buoy was in sight, dancing in the open sea; and to the buoy he would go, and to it he went.  He passed great shoals of bass and mullet, leaping and rushing in after the shrimps, but he never heeded them, or they him; and once he passed a great black shining seal, who was coming in after the mullet.  The seal put his head and shoulders out of water, and stared at him, looking exactly like a fat old greasy negro with a gray pate.  And Tom, instead of being frightened, said, "How d"ye do, sir; what a beautiful place the sea is!"  And the old seal, instead of trying to bite him, looked at him with his soft sleepy winking eyes, and said, "Good tide to you, my little man; are you looking for your brothers and sisters?  I passed them all at play outside."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='465'>"Oh, then," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='breath;playfellow;none;water-baby;round' adjectives='last' verbs='swim;be;look;get;sit;see;say;have;buoy' valence='6.02733333333' arousal='3.65733333333' dominance='5.758'>Tom</entity>, "I shall have playfellows at last," and he swam on to the buoy, and got upon it (for he was quite out of breath) and sat there, and looked round for water-babies:  but there were none to be seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='466'>The sea-breeze came in freshly with the tide and blew the fog away; and the little waves danced for joy around the buoy, and the old buoy danced with them.  The shadows of the clouds ran races over the bright blue bay, and yet never caught each other up; and the breakers plunged merrily upon the wide white sands, and jumped up over the rocks, to see what the green fields inside were like, and tumbled down and broke themselves all to pieces, and never minded it a bit, but mended themselves and jumped up again.  And the terns hovered over Tom like huge white dragon-flies with black heads, and the gulls laughed like girls at play, and the sea-pies, with their red bills and legs, flew to and fro from shore to shore, and whistled sweet and wild.  And Tom looked and looked, and listened; and he would have been very happy, if he could only have seen the water-babies.  Then when the tide turned, he left the buoy, and swam round and round in search of them:  but in vain.  Sometimes he thought he heard them laughing:  but it was only the laughter of the ripples.  And sometimes he thought he saw them at the bottom: but it was only white and pink shells.  And once he was sure he had found one, for he saw two bright eyes peeping out of the sand.  So he dived down, and began scraping the sand away, and cried, "Don"t hide; I do want some one to play with so much!"  And out jumped a great turbot with his ugly eyes and mouth all awry, and flopped away along the bottom, knocking poor Tom over.  And he sat down at the bottom of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tear;salt;disappointment;bottom' adjectives='sheer' verbs='cry;sit' valence='4.57125' arousal='4.30125' dominance='4.815'>the sea</entity>, and cried salt tears from sheer disappointment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='467'>To have come all this way, and faced so many dangers, and yet to find no water-babies!  How hard!  Well, it did seem hard:  but people, even little babies, cannot have all they want without waiting for it, and working for it too, my little man, as you will find out some day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='468'>And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='water-baby;sea' adjectives='long' verbs='come;buoy;wonder;look;sit' valence='5.86272727273' arousal='3.39090909091' dominance='5.75181818182'>Tom</entity> sat upon the buoy long days, long weeks, looking out to sea, and wondering when the water-babies would come back; and yet they never came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='469'>Then he began to ask all the strange things which came in out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;thing' adjectives='strange' verbs='begin;see;say;have;ask;come' valence='5.881' arousal='3.591' dominance='5.934'>the sea</entity> if they had seen any; and some said "Yes," and some said nothing at all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='470'>He asked the bass and the pollock; but they were so greedy after the shrimps that they did not care to answer him a word.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='471'>Then there came in a whole fleet of purple sea-snails, floating along, each on a sponge full of foam, and Tom said, "Where do you come from, you pretty creatures? and have you seen the water- babies?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='472'>And the sea-snails answered, "Whence we come we know not; and whither we are going, who can tell?  We float out our life in the mid-ocean, with the warm sunshine above our heads, and the warm gulf-stream below; and that is enough for us.  Yes; perhaps we have seen the water-babies.  We have seen many strange things as we sailed along."  And they floated away, the happy stupid things, and all went ashore upon the sands.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='473'>Then there came in a great lazy sunfish, as big as a fat pig cut in half; and he seemed to have been cut in half too, and squeezed in a clothes-press till he was flat; but to all his big body and big fins he had only a little rabbit"s mouth, no bigger than <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;cut;pig;s;mouth;rabbit;half;voice;fin;sunfish' adjectives='flat;great;big;lazy;fat;little;feeble;bigger;clothes-press' verbs='be;cut;question;have;answer;seem;squeeze;come' valence='5.30257142857' arousal='4.14171428571' dominance='5.29428571429'>Tom</entity>"s; and, when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;cut;pig;s;mouth;rabbit;half;voice;fin;sunfish' adjectives='flat;great;big;lazy;fat;little;feeble;bigger;clothes-press' verbs='be;cut;question;have;answer;seem;squeeze;come' valence='5.30257142857' arousal='4.14171428571' dominance='5.29428571429'>Tom</entity> questioned him, he answered in a little squeaky feeble voice:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='475'>And, when Tom asked him again, he could only answer, "I"ve lost my way.  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='t;talk' adjectives='' verbs='think;want' valence='5.72' arousal='4.57' dominance='5.555'>Don</entity>"t talk to me; I want to think."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='476'>But, like a good many other people, the more he tried to think the less he could think; and Tom saw him blundering about all day, till the coast-guardsmen saw his big fin above the water, and rowed out, and struck a boat-hook into him, and took him away.  They took him up to the town and showed him for a penny a head, and made a good day"s work of it.  But of course <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course' adjectives='' verbs='do;know' valence='6.115' arousal='3.455' dominance='6.065'>Tom</entity> did not know that.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='477'>Then there came by a shoal of porpoises, rolling as they went-- papas, and mammas, and little children--and all quite smooth and shiny, because the fairies French-polish them every morning; and they sighed so softly as they came by, that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='papa;courage;mamma;shoal;child;fairy;porpoise' adjectives='hush;shiny;little;smooth' verbs='be;sigh;answer;say;take;have;learn;go;come;roll;speak' valence='6.07181818182' arousal='4.13727272727' dominance='5.88727272727'>Tom</entity> took courage to speak to them:  but all they answered was, "Hush, hush, hush;" for that was all they had learnt to say.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='478'>And then there came a shoal of basking sharks" some of them as long as a boat, and Tom was frightened at them.  But they were very lazy good-natured fellows, not greedy tyrants, like white sharks and blue sharks and ground sharks and hammer-heads, who eat men, or saw-fish and threshers and ice-sharks, who hunt the poor old whales.  They came and rubbed their great sides against the buoy, and lay basking in the sun with their backfins out of water; and winked at Tom:  but he never could get them to speak.  They had eaten so many herrings that they were quite stupid; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='collier;smell;herring;nose;brig' adjectives='many;stupid;long;glad' verbs='do;be;frighten;have;hold;come;eat' valence='5.47588235294' arousal='3.96764705882' dominance='5.35117647059'>Tom</entity> was glad when a collier brig came by and frightened them all away; for they did smell most horribly, certainly, and he had to hold his nose tight as long as they were there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='479'>And then there came by a beautiful creature, like a ribbon of pure silver with a sharp head and very long teeth; but it seemed very sick and sad.

So I got tangled among the icebergs, and chilled with their frozen breath.  But the water-babies helped me from among them, and set me free again.  And now I am mending every day; but I am very sick and sad; and perhaps I shall never get home again to play with the owl-rays any more."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='482'>"Oh!" cried Tom.  "And you have seen water-babies?  Have you seen any near here?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='486'>But one day among the rocks he found a playfellow.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='489'>But Tom was most astonished to see how he fired himself off--snap! like the leap-frogs which you make out of a goose"s breast-bone. Certainly he took the most wonderful shots, and backwards, too. For, if he wanted to go into a narrow crack ten yards off, what do you think he did?  If he had gone in head foremost, of course he could not have turned round.  So he used to turn his tail to it, and lay his long horns, which carry his sixth sense in their tips (and nobody knows what that sixth sense is), straight down his back to guide him, and twist his eyes back till they almost came out of their sockets, and then made ready, present, fire, snap!--and away he went, pop into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='whisker;t;pop' adjectives='' verbs='do;couldn;say;twiddle;go;peep' valence='5.54875' arousal='4.28375' dominance='5.34125'>the hole</entity>; and peeped out and twiddled his whiskers, as much as to say, "You couldn"t do that."</paragraph>

At least, here she comes, looking like a clean white good little darling, as she always was, and always will be.

Four days a week he hunted, and very good sport he had; and the other two he went to the bench and the board of guardians, and very good justice he did; and, when he got home in time, he dined at five; for he hated this absurd new fashion of dining at eight in the hunting season, which forces a man to make interest with the footman for cold beef and beer as soon as he comes in, and so spoil his appetite, and then sleep in an arm-chair in his bedroom, all stiff and tired, for two or three hours before he can get his dinner like a gentleman.  And do you be like Sir John, my dear little man, when you are your own master; and, if you want either to read hard or ride hard, stick to the good old Cambridge hours of breakfast at eight and dinner at five; by which you may get two days" work out of one.  But, of course, if you find a fox at three in the afternoon and run him till dark, and leave off twenty miles from home, why you must wait for your dinner till you can get it, as better men than you have done.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='500'>He had met Sir John at Scarborough, or Fleetwood, or somewhere or other (if you don"t care where, nobody else does), and had made acquaintance with him, and become very fond of his children.  Now, Sir John knew nothing about sea-cockyolybirds, and cared less, provided the fishmonger sent him good fish for dinner; and My Lady knew as little:  but she thought it proper that the children should know something.  For in the stupid old times, you must understand, children were taught to know one thing, and to know it well; but in these enlightened new times they are taught to know a little about everything, and to know it all ill; which is a great deal pleasanter and easier, and therefore quite right.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='501'>So Ellie and he were walking on the rocks, and he was showing her about one in ten thousand of all the beautiful and curious things which are to be seen there.  But little Ellie was not satisfied with them at all.  She liked much better to play with live children, or even with dolls, which she could pretend were alive; and at last she said honestly, "I don"t care about all these things, because they can"t play with me, or talk to me.  If there were little children now in the water, as there used to be, and I could see them, I should like that."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='502'>"Children in the water, you strange little duck?" said the professor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>"Yes," said Ellie.  "I know there used to be children in the water, and mermaids too, and mermen.  I saw them all in a picture at home, of a beautiful lady sailing in a car drawn by dolphins, and babies flying round her, and one sitting in her lap; and the mermaids swimming and playing, and the mermen trumpeting on conch-shells; and it is called "The Triumph of Galatea;" and there is a burning mountain in the picture behind.  It hangs on the great staircase, and I have looked at it ever since I was a baby, and dreamt about it a hundred times; and it is so beautiful, that it must be true."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='504'>But the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful.  For at that rate, he said, the Baltas would be quite right in thinking it a fine thing to eat their grandpapas, because they thought it an ugly thing to put them underground.  The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='505'>He held very strange theories about a good many things.  He had even got up once at the British Association, and declared that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have.  Which was a shocking thing to say; for, if it were so, what would become of the faith, hope, and charity of immortal millions?  You may think that there are other more important differences between you and an ape, such as being able to speak, and make machines, and know right from wrong, and say your prayers, and other little matters of that kind; but that is a child"s fancy, my dear. Nothing is to be depended on but the great hippopotamus test.  If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape, though you had four hands, no feet, and were more apish than the apes of all aperies.  But if a hippopotamus major is ever discovered in one single ape"s brain, nothing will save your great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-great-great-great-greater-greatest- grandmother from having been an ape too.  No, my dear little man; always remember that the one true, certain, final, and all- important difference between you and an ape is, that you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, and it has none; and that, therefore, to discover one in its brain will be a very wrong and dangerous thing, at which every one will be very much shocked, as we may suppose they were at the professor.--Though really, after all, it don"t much matter; because--as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='though;something;nobody;ape;matter;s;other;brain;t;hippopotamus;man' adjectives='much' verbs='be;don;discover;know;have;put' valence='5.81227272727' arousal='4.02090909091' dominance='5.65272727273'>Lord Dundreary</entity> and others would put it--nobody but men have hippopotamuses in their brains; so, if a hippopotamus was discovered in an ape"s brain, why it would not be one, you know, but something else.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='506'>But the professor had gone, I am sorry to say, even further than that; for he had read at the British Association at Melbourne, Australia, in the year 1999, a paper which assured every one who found himself the better or wiser for the news, that there were not, never had been, and could not be, any rational or half- rational beings except men, anywhere, anywhen, or anyhow; that nymphs, satyrs, fauns, inui, dwarfs, trolls, elves, gnomes, fairies, brownies, nixes, wills, kobolds, leprechaunes, cluricaunes, banshees, will-o"-the-wisps, follets, lutins, magots, goblins, afrits, marids, jinns, ghouls, peris, deevs, angels, archangels, imps, bogies, or worse, were nothing at all, and pure bosh and wind.  And he had to get up very early in the morning to prove that, and to eat his breakfast overnight; but he did it, at least to his own satisfaction.  Whereon a certain great divine, and a very clever divine was he, called him a regular Sadducee; and probably he was quite right.  Whereon the professor, in return, called him a regular Pharisee; and probably he was quite right too. But they did not quarrel in the least; for, when men are men of the world, hard words run off them like water off a duck"s back.  So the professor and the divine met at dinner that evening, and sat together on the sofa afterwards for an hour, and talked over the state of female labour on the antarctic continent (for nobody talks shop after his claret), and each vowed that the other was the best company he ever met in his life.  What an advantage it is to be men of the world!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='507'>From all which you may guess that the professor was not the least of little Ellie"s opinion.  So he gave her a succinct compendium of his famous paper at the British Association, in a form suited for the youthful mind.

He would have kept him alive, and petted him (for he was a very kind old gentleman), and written a book about him, and given him two long names, of which the first would have said a little about Tom, and the second all about himself; for of course he would have called him Hydrotecnon Ptthmllnsprtsianum, or some other long name like that; for they are forced to call everything by long names now, because they have used up all the short ones, ever since they took to making nine species out of one.

And what would <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;tell;have' valence='5.7375' arousal='3.905' dominance='5.87'>Ellie</entity> say, after what he had just told her?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='523'>There was a wise old heathen once, who said, "Maxima debetur pueris reverentia"--The greatest reverence is due to children; that is, that grown people should never say or do anything wrong before children, lest they should set them a bad example.--Cousin Cramchild says it means, "The greatest respectfulness is expected from little boys."  But he was raised in a country where little boys are not expected to be respectful, because all of them are as good as the President:- Well, every one knows his own concerns best; so perhaps they are.  But poor Cousin Cramchild, to do him justice, not being of that opinion, and having a moral mission, and being no scholar to speak of, and hard up for an authority--why, it was a very great temptation for him.  But some people, and I am afraid the professor was one of them, interpret that in a more strange, curious, one-sided, left-handed, topsy-turvy, inside-out, behind-before fashion than even Cousin Cramchild; for they make it mean, that you must show your respect for children, by never confessing yourself in the wrong to them, even if you know that you are so, lest they should lose confidence in their elders.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='524'>Now, if the professor had said to Ellie, "Yes, my darling, it is a water-baby, and a very wonderful thing it is; and it shows how little I know of the wonders of nature, in spite of forty years" honest labour.  I was just telling you that there could be no such creatures; and, behold! here is one come to confound my conceit and show me that Nature can do, and has done, beyond all that man"s poor fancy can imagine.  So, let us thank the Maker, and Inspirer, and Lord of Nature for all His wonderful and glorious works, and try and find out something about this one;"--I think that, if the professor had said that, little Ellie would have believed him more firmly, and respected him more deeply, and loved him better, than ever she had done before.  But he was of a different opinion.  He hesitated a moment.  He longed to keep Tom, and yet he half wished he never had caught him; and at last he quite longed to get rid of him.  So he turned away and poked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='maid;head;water-baby;finger;anything' adjectives='better;little;full' verbs='do;poke;want;be;turn;say;have;dream' valence='5.83066666667' arousal='4.04933333333' dominance='5.764'>Tom</entity> with his finger, for want of anything better to do; and said carelessly, "My dear little maid, you must have dreamt of water-babies last night, your head is so full of them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='525'>Now Tom had been in the most horrible and unspeakable fright all the while; and had kept as quiet as he could, though he was called a Holothurian and a Cephalopod; for it was fixed in his little head that if a man with clothes on caught him, he might put clothes on him too, and make a dirty black chimney-sweep of him again.  But, when the professor poked him, it was more than he could bear; and, between fright and rage, he turned to bay as valiantly as a mouse in a corner, and bit the professor"s finger till it bled.</paragraph>

So somehow or other the Jack-tars got the lobster out, and set the mayor free, and put him ashore at the Barbican.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='644'>"Well, this is wonderful!  I have seen things just like you again and again, but I thought you were shells, or sea-creatures.  I never took you for water-babies like myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='645'>Now, was not that very odd?  So odd, indeed, that you will, no doubt, want to know how it happened, and why Tom could never find a water-baby till after he had got the lobster out of the pot.  And, if you will read this story nine times over, and then think for yourself, you will find out why.  It is not good for little boys to be told everything, and never to be forced to use their own wits. They would learn, then, no more than they do at Dr. Dulcimer"s famous suburban establishment for the idler members of the youthful aristocracy, where the masters learn the lessons and the boys hear them--which saves a great deal of trouble--for the time being.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='646'>"Now," said the baby, "come and help me, or I shall not have finished before my brothers and sisters come, and it is time to go home."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='647'>"What shall I help you at?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='648'>"At this poor dear little rock; a great clumsy boulder came rolling by in the last storm, and knocked all its head off, and rubbed off all its flowers.

And then Tom heard all the other babies coming, laughing and singing and shouting and romping; and the noise they made was just like the noise of the ripple.  So he knew that he had been hearing and seeing the water-babies all along; only he did not know them, because his eyes and ears were not opened.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='652'>And this is the reason why the rock-pools are always so neat and clean; because the water-babies come inshore after every storm to sweep them out, and comb them down, and put them all to rights again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='653'>Only where men are wasteful and dirty, and let sewers run into the sea instead of putting the stuff upon the fields like thrifty reasonable souls; or throw herrings" heads and dead dog-fish, or any other refuse, into the water; or in any way make a mess upon the clean shore--there the water-babies will not come, sometimes not for hundreds of years (for they cannot abide anything smelly or foul), but leave the sea-anemones and the crabs to clear away everything, till the good tidy sea has covered up all the dirt in soft mud and clean sand, where the water-babies can plant live cockles and whelks and razor-shells and sea-cucumbers and golden- combs, and make a pretty live garden again, after man"s dirt is cleared away.

And far away, before the setting sun, he saw a blue fairy sea, and golden fairy islands, and he said, "Those are the islands of the blest."  Then he and his friends got into a hooker, and sailed away and away to the westward, and were never heard of more.  But the people who would not hear him were changed into gorillas, and gorillas they are until this day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='657'>And when St. Brandan and the hermits came to that fairy isle they found it overgrown with cedars and full of beautiful birds; and he sat down under the cedars and preached to all the birds in the air. And they liked his sermons so well that they told the fishes in the sea; and they came, and St. Brandan preached to them; and the fishes told the water-babies, who live in the caves under the isle; and they came up by hundreds every Sunday, and St. Brandan got quite a neat little Sunday-school.  And there he taught the water- babies for a great many hundred years, till his eyes grew too dim to see, and his beard grew so long that he dared not walk for fear of treading on it, and then he might have tumbled down.  And at last he and the five hermits fell fast asleep under the cedar- shades, and there they sleep unto this day.  But the fairies took to the water-babies, and taught them their lessons themselves.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='660'>Now when Tom got there, he found that the isle stood all on pillars, and that its roots were full of caves.  There were pillars of black basalt, like Staffa; and pillars of green and crimson serpentine, like Kynance; and pillars ribboned with red and white and yellow sandstone, like Livermead; and there were blue grottoes like Capri, and white grottoes like Adelsberg; all curtained and draped with seaweeds, purple and crimson, green and brown; and strewn with soft white sand, on which the water-babies sleep every night.  But, to keep the place clean and sweet, the crabs picked up all the scraps off the floor and ate them like so many monkeys; while the rocks were covered with ten thousand sea-anemones, and corals and madrepores, who scavenged the water all day long, and kept it nice and pure.

She only answered, "I look after them all the week round; and they are in a very different place from this, because they knew that they were doing wrong."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='719'>She spoke very quietly; but there was something in her voice which made <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;sea-nettle;tingle;something;shoal;foot;voice' adjectives='' verbs='be;make;get;have;speak' valence='5.84' arousal='3.919' dominance='5.725'>Tom</entity> tingle from head to foot, as if he had got into a shoal of sea-nettles.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='720'>"But these people," she went on, "did not know that they were doing wrong:  they were only stupid and impatient; and therefore I only punish them till they become patient, and learn to use their common sense like reasonable beings.  But as for chimney-sweeps, and collier-boys, and nailer lads, my sister has set good people to stop all that sort of thing; and very much obliged to her I am; for if she could only stop the cruel masters from ill-using poor children, I should grow handsome at least a thousand years sooner. And now do you be a good boy, and do as you would be done by, which they did not; and then, when my sister, MADAME DOASYOUWOULDBEDONEBY, comes on Sunday, perhaps she will take notice of you, and teach you how to behave.  She understands that better than I do."  And so she went.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='721'>Tom was very glad to hear that there was no chance of meeting Grimes again, though he was a little sorry for him, considering that he used sometimes to give him the leavings of the beer:  but he determined to be a very good boy all Saturday; and he was; for he never frightened one crab, nor tickled any live corals, nor put stones into the sea anemones" mouths, to make them fancy they had got a dinner; and when Sunday morning came, sure enough, MRS. DOASYOUWOULDBEDONEBY came too.  Whereat all the little children began dancing and clapping their hands, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hand;might;whereat;child' adjectives='little' verbs='dance;begin;clap' valence='6.45714285714' arousal='4.60428571429' dominance='5.92571428571'>Tom</entity> danced too with all his might.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='722'>And as for the pretty lady, I cannot tell you what the colour of her hair was, or, of her eyes:  no more could Tom; for, when any one looks at her, all they can think of is, that she has the sweetest, kindest, tenderest, funniest, merriest face they ever saw, or want to see.  But Tom saw that she was a very tall woman, as tall as her sister:  but instead of being gnarly and horny, and scaly, and prickly, like her, she was the most nice, soft, fat, smooth, pussy, cuddly, delicious creature who ever nursed a baby; and she understood babies thoroughly, for she had plenty of her own, whole rows and regiments of them, and has to this day.  And all her delight was, whenever she had a spare moment, to play with babies, in which she showed herself a woman of sense; for babies are the best company, and the pleasantest playfellows, in the world; at least, so all the wise people in the world think.  And therefore when the children saw her, they naturally all caught hold of her, and pulled her till she sat down on a stone, and climbed into her lap, and clung round her neck, and caught hold of her hands; and then they all put their thumbs into their mouths, and began cuddling and purring like so many kittens, as they ought to have done.  While those who could get nowhere else sat down on the sand, and cuddled her feet--for no one, you know, wear shoes in the water, except horrid old bathing-women, who are afraid of the water-babies pinching their horny toes.  And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='stare;be;understand;stand' valence='5.645' arousal='3.6825' dominance='6.12'>Tom</entity> stood staring at them; for he could not understand what it was all about.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='749'>I come to the very saddest part of all my story.  I know some people will only laugh at it, and call it much ado about nothing. But I know one man who would not; and he was an officer with a pair of gray moustaches as long as your arm, who said once in company that two of the most heart-rending sights in the world, which moved him most to tears, which he would do anything to prevent or remedy, were a child over a broken toy and a child stealing sweets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='750'>The company did not laugh at him; his moustaches were too long and too gray for that:  but, after he was gone, they called him sentimental and so forth, all but one dear little old Quaker lady with a soul as white as her cap, who was not, of course, generally partial to soldiers; and she said very quietly, like a Quaker:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='751'>"Friends, it is borne upon my mind that that is a truly brave man."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='752'>Now you may fancy that Tom was quite good, when he had everything that he could want or wish:  but you would be very much mistaken. Being quite comfortable is a very good thing; but it does not make people good.  Indeed, it sometimes makes them naughty, as it has made the people in America; and as it made the people in the Bible, who waxed fat and kicked, like horses overfed and underworked.  And I am very sorry to say that this happened to little Tom.  For he grew so fond of the sea-bullseyes and sea-lollipops that his foolish little head could think of nothing else:  and he was always longing for more, and wondering when the strange lady would come again and give him some, and what she would give him, and how much, and whether she would give him more than the others.  And he thought of nothing but lollipops by day, and dreamt of nothing else by night--and what happened then?</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='754'>And he longed to go to the cabinet, and yet he was afraid; and then he longed again, and was less afraid; and at last, by continual thinking about it, he longed so violently that he was not afraid at all.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='755'>But, when he saw all the nice things inside, instead of being delighted, he was quite frightened, and wished he had never come there.

And it is strange, but true, that no one can say; and that those who have been oftenest in it, or even nearest to it, can say least about it, and make people understand least what it is like.

And, when Ellie went home on Sunday, he fretted and cried all day, and did not care to listen to the fairy"s stories about good children, though they were prettier than ever.  Indeed, the more he overheard of them, the less he liked to listen, because they were all about children who did what they did not like, and took trouble for other people, and worked to feed their little brothers and sisters instead of caring only for their play.

And then she told him how he had been in the nursery long enough, and must go out now and see the world, if he intended ever to be a man; and how he must go all alone by himself, as every one else that ever was born has to go, and see with his own eyes, and smell with his own nose, and make his own bed and lie on it, and burn his own fingers if he put them into the fire.

And they were few in number:  but they only said, The more the merrier, but the fewer the better fare. However, that was not quite true; for all the flapdoodle-trees were killed by the volcano, and they had eaten all the roast pigs, who, of course, could not be expected to have little ones.  So they had to live very hard, on nuts and roots which they scratched out of the ground with sticks.  Some of them talked of sowing corn, as their ancestors used to do, before they came into the land of Readymade; but they had forgotten how to make ploughs (they had forgotten even how to make Jews" harps by this time), and had eaten all the seed-corn which they brought out of the land of Hardwork years since; and of course it was too much trouble to go away and find more.

But it was of no use, and the dog was hanged:  and Tom couldn"t even have his carcase; for they had abolished the have-his-carcase act in that country, for fear lest when rogues fell out, honest men should come by their own.  And so they would have succeeded perfectly, as they always do, only that (as they also always do) they failed in one little particular, viz. that the dog would not die, being a water-dog, but bit their fingers so abominably that they were forced to let him go, and Tom likewise, as British subjects.

Therefore, as new brooms sweep clean, we may hope for some warm weather this year.  And that is the end of my story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1301'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1302'>MORAL.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1303'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1304'>And now, my dear little man, what should we learn from this parable?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1305'>We should learn thirty-seven or thirty-nine things, I am not exactly sure which:  but one thing, at least, we may learn, and that is this--when we see efts in the pond, never to throw stones at them, or catch them with crooked pins, or put them into vivariums with sticklebacks, that the sticklebacks may prick them in their poor little stomachs, and make them jump out of the glass into somebody"s work-box, and so come to a bad end.  For these efts are nothing else but the water-babies who are stupid and dirty, and will not learn their lessons and keep themselves clean; and, therefore (as comparative anatomists will tell you fifty years hence, though they are not learned enough to tell you now), their skulls grow flat, their jaws grow out, and their brains grow small, and their tails grow long, and they lose all their ribs (which I am sure you would not like to do), and their skins grow dirty and spotted, and they never get into the clear rivers, much less into the great wide sea, but hang about in dirty ponds, and live in the mud, and eat worms, as they deserve to do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1306'>But that is no reason why you should ill-use them:  but only why you should pity them, and be kind to them, and hope that some day they will wake up, and be ashamed of their nasty, dirty, lazy, stupid life, and try to amend, and become something better once more.  For, perhaps, if they do so, then after 379,423 years, nine months, thirteen days, two hours, and twenty-one minutes (for aught that appears to the contrary), if they work very hard and wash very hard all that time, their brains may grow bigger, and their jaws grow smaller, and their ribs come back, and their tails wither off, and they will turn into water-babies again, and perhaps after that into land-babies; and after that perhaps into grown men.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1307'>You know they won"t?  Very well, I daresay you know best.  But you see, some folks have a great liking for those poor little efts. They never did anybody any harm, or could if they tried; and their only fault is, that they do no good--any more than some thousands of their betters.  But what with ducks, and what with pike, and what with sticklebacks, and what with water-beetles, and what with naughty boys, they are "sae sair hadden doun," as the Scotsmen say, that it is a wonder how they live; and some folks can"t help hoping, with good <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pike;help;boy;water-beetle;chance;t;thing;hadden;folk;duck;somewhen;wonder;doun;stickleback' adjectives='good;naughty;fair' verbs='be;make;live;say;have;hope' valence='6.12125' arousal='4.00333333333' dominance='5.87166666667'>Bishop Butler</entity>, that they may have another chance, to make things fair and even, somewhere, somewhen, somehow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1308'>Meanwhile, do you learn your lessons, and thank God that you have plenty of cold water to wash in; and wash in it too, like a true Englishman.  And then, if my story is not true, something better is; and if I am not quite right, still you will be, as long as you stick to hard work and cold water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1309'>But remember always, as I told you at first, that this is all a fairy tale, and only fun and pretence:  and, therefore, you are not to believe a word of it, even if it is true.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='5'>The tales in the Grey Fairy Book are derived from many countries--Lithuania, various parts of Africa, Germany, France, Greece, and other regions of the world. They have been translated and adapted by Mrs. Dent, Mrs. Lang, Miss Eleanor Sellar, Miss Blackley, and Miss hang. "The Three Sons of Hali" is from the last century "Cabinet des Fees," a very large collection. The French author may have had some Oriental original before him in parts; at all events he copied the Eastern method of putting tale within tale, like the Eastern balls of carved ivory. The stories, as usual, illustrate the method of popular fiction. A certain number of incidents are shaken into many varying combinations, like the fragments of coloured glass in the kaleidoscope. Probably the possible combinations, like possible musical combinations, are not unlimited in number, but children may be less sensitive in the matter of fairies than Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='combination;number;matter;mr.;music;child;fairy' adjectives='sensitive;unlimited;possible;musical' verbs='be;regard' valence='6.32421052632' arousal='3.94631578947' dominance='5.88947368421'>John Stuart Mill</entity> was as regards music.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='44'>There was once upon a time a king who was so much beloved by his subjects that he thought himself the happiest monarch in the whole world, and he had everything his heart could desire. His palace was filled with the rarest of curiosities, and his gardens with the sweetest flowers, while in the marble stalls of his stables stood a row of milk-white Arabs, with big brown eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>Strangers who had heard of the marvels which the king had collected, and made long journeys to see them, were, however, surprised to find the most splendid stall of all occupied by a donkey, with particularly large and drooping ears. It was a very fine donkey; but still, as far as they could tell, nothing so very remarkable as to account for the care with which it was lodged; and they went away wondering, for they could not know that every night, when it was asleep, bushels of gold pieces tumbled out of its ears, which were picked up each morning by the attendants.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='46'>After many years of prosperity a sudden blow fell upon the king in the death of his wife, whom he loved dearly. But before she died, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='strength;happiness' adjectives='' verbs='die;say;gather;think;have' valence='6.10888888889' arousal='4.94' dominance='6.12'>the queen</entity>, who had always thought first of his happiness, gathered all her strength, and said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='47'>"Promise me one thing: you must marry again, I know, for the good of your people, as well as of yourself. But do not set about it in a hurry. Wait until you have found a woman more beautiful and better formed than myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='48'>"Oh, do not speak to me of marrying," sobbed the king; "rather let me die with you!" But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pillow' adjectives='' verbs='smile;die;turn' valence='5.706' arousal='4.59' dominance='5.852'>the queen</entity> only smiled faintly, and turned over on her pillow and died.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>For some months the king"s grief was great; then gradually he began to forget a little, and, besides, his counsellors were always urging him to seek another wife. At first he refused to listen to them, but by-and-by he allowed himself to be persuaded to think of it, only stipulating that the bride should be more beautiful and attractive than the late queen, according to the promise he had made her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='50'>Overjoyed at having obtained what they wanted, the counsellors sent envoys far and wide to get portraits of all the most famous beauties of every country. The artists were very busy and did their best, but, alas! nobody could even pretend that any of the ladies could compare for a moment with the late queen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>At length, one day, when he had turned away discouraged from a fresh collection of pictures, the king"s eyes fell on his adopted daughter, who had lived in the palace since she was a baby, and he saw that, if a woman existed on the whole earth more lovely than the queen, this was she! He at once made known what his wishes were, but the young girl, who was not at all ambitious, and had not the faintest desire to marry him, was filled with dismay, and begged for time to think about it. That night, when everyone was asleep, she started in a little car drawn by a big sheep, and went to consult her fairy godmother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='52'>"I know what you have come to tell me," said the fairy, when the maiden stepped out of the car; "and if you don"t wish to marry him, I will show you how to avoid it. Ask him to give you a dress that exactly matches the sky. It will be impossible for him to get one, so you will be quite safe." <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home' adjectives='' verbs='return;thank' valence='7.012' arousal='4.134' dominance='6.204'>The girl</entity> thanked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home' adjectives='' verbs='return;thank' valence='7.012' arousal='4.134' dominance='6.204'>the fairy</entity> and returned home again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='53'>The next morning, when her father (as she had always called him) came to see her, she told him that she could give him no answer until he had presented her with a dress the colour of the sky. The king, overjoyed at this answer, sent for all the choicest weavers and dressmakers in the kingdom, and commanded them to make a robe the colour of the sky without an instant"s delay, or he would cut off their heads at once. Dreadfully frightened at this threat, they all began to dye and cut and sew, and in two days they brought back the dress, which looked as if it had been cut straight out of the heavens! The poor girl was thunderstruck, and did not know what to do; so in the night she harnessed her sheep again, and went in search of her godmother.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>"Madam, I can refuse you nothing," said he; and he ordered the dress to be ready in twenty-four hours, or every man should be hanged.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='57'>They set to work with all their might, and by dawn next day, the dress of moonbeams was laid across her bed. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='help;beauty' adjectives='' verbs='begin;help;cry;admire;hear;come' valence='6.467' arousal='4.423' dominance='5.929'>The girl</entity>, though she could not help admiring its beauty, began to cry, till <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='help;beauty' adjectives='' verbs='begin;help;cry;admire;hear;come' valence='6.467' arousal='4.423' dominance='5.929'>the fairy</entity>, who heard her, came to her help.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>"There is only one thing to be done now," cried she; "you must demand the skin of the ass he sets such store by. It is from that donkey he obtains all his vast riches, and I am sure he will never give it to you."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='64'>The king was both astonished and grieved at this new request, but did not hesitate an instant.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>The poor girl, seeing no escape from the fate she dreaded, wept afresh, and tore her hair; when, suddenly, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hair;girl;fate;escape' adjectives='poor' verbs='tear;see;weep;dread;stand' valence='4.93272727273' arousal='4.48181818182' dominance='5.32272727273'>the fairy</entity> stood before her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>"Take heart," she said, "all will now go well! Wrap yourself in this skin, and leave the palace and go as far as you can. I will look after you.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='68'>Directly she was missed there was a great hue and cry, and every corner, possible and impossible, was searched.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>The princess walked on a long, long way, trying to find some one who would take her in, and let her work for them; but though the cottagers, whose houses she passed, gave her food from charity, the ass"s skin was so dirty they would not allow her to enter their houses. For her flight had been so hurried she had had no time to clean it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='70'>Tired and disheartened at her ill-fortune, she was wandering, one day, past the gate of a farmyard, situated just outside the walls of a large town, when she heard a voice calling to her. She turned and saw <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='standing;turkey;s;sign;wife' adjectives='' verbs='turn;see;come;make' valence='5.59444444444' arousal='3.82444444444' dominance='5.58666666667'>the farmer</entity>"s wife standing among her turkeys, and making signs to her to come in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>"I want a girl to wash the dishes and feed the turkeys, and clean out the pig-sty," said the w omen, "and, to judge by your dirty clothes, you would not be too fine for the work."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='72'>The girl accepted her offer with joy, and she was at once set to work in a corner of the kitchen, where all the farm servants came and made fun of her, and the ass"s skin in which she was wrapped. But by-and-by they got so used to the sight of it that it ceased to amuse them, and she worked so hard and so well, that her mistress grew quite fond of her. And she was so clever at keeping sheep and herding turkeys that you would have thought she had done nothing else during her whole life!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='73'>One day she was sitting on the banks of a stream bewailing her wretched lot, when she suddenly caught sight of herself in the water. Her hair and part of her face was quite concealed by the ass"s head, which was drawn right over like a hood, and the filthy matted skin covered her whole body. It was the first time she had seen herself as other people saw her, and she was filled with shame at the spectacle. Then she threw off her disguise and jumped into the water, plunging in again and again, till she shone like ivory. When it was time to go back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='farm;time;thought;to-morrow;skin;girl;holiday;princess' adjectives='able;dirty;more' verbs='be;force;forget;do;comfort;put;disguise;go;seem' valence='5.72193548387' arousal='3.99419354839' dominance='5.43516129032'>the farm</entity>, she was forced to put on the skin which disguised her, and now seemed more dirty than ever; but, as she did so, she comforted herself with the thought that to-morrow was a holiday, and that she would be able for a few hours to forget that she was a farm girl, and be a princess once more.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>So, at break of day, she stamped on the ground, as the fairy had told her, and instantly the dress like the sky lay across her tiny bed. Her room was so small that there was no place for the train of her dress to spread itself out, but she pinned it up carefully when she combed her beautiful hair and piled it up on the top of her head, as she had always worn it. When she had done, she was so pleased with herself that she determined never to let a chance pass of putting on her splendid clothes, even if she had to wear them in the fields, with no one to admire her but the sheep and turkeys.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='75'>Now the farm was a royal farm, and, one holiday, when "Donkey Skin" (as they had nicknamed the princess) had locked the door of her room and clothed herself in her dress of sunshine, the king"s son rode through the gate, and asked if he might come and rest himself a little after hunting. Some food and milk were set before him in the garden, and when he felt rested he got up, and began to explore the house, which was famous throughout the whole kingdom for its age and beauty. He opened one door after the other, admiring the old rooms, when he came to a handle that would not turn. He stooped and peeped through the keyhole to see what was inside, and was greatly astonished at beholding a beautiful girl, clad in a dress so dazzling that he could hardly look at it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='76'>The dark gallery seemed darker than ever as he turned away, but he went back to the kitchen and inquired who slept in the room at the end of the passage. The scullery maid, they told him, whom everybody laughed at, and called "Donkey Skin;" and though he perceived there was some strange mystery about this, he saw quite clearly there was nothing to be gained by asking any more questions. So he rode back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;keyhole;vision' adjectives='' verbs='ride;see;have;fill' valence='5.87333333333' arousal='3.85777777778' dominance='5.77444444444'>the palace</entity>, his head filled with the vision he had seen through the keyhole.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='77'>All night long he tossed about, and awoke the next morning in a high fever. The queen, who had no other child, and lived in a state of perpetual anxiety about this one, at once gave him up for lost, and indeed his sudden illness puzzled the greatest doctors, who tried the usual remedies in vain. At last they told the queen that some secret sorrow must be at the bottom of all this, and she threw herself on her knees beside her son"s bed, and implored him to confide his trouble to her. If it was ambition to be king, his father would gladly resign the cares of the crown, and suffer him to reign in his stead; or, if it was love, everything should be sacrificed to get for him the wife he desired, even if she were daughter of a king with whom <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='king;love;wife;father;crown;everything;stead;ambition;daughter;war' adjectives='' verbs='desire;be;get;sacrifice;reign;resign;suffer;care' valence='5.89925925926' arousal='4.20444444444' dominance='5.52777777778'>the country</entity> was at war at present!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='78'>"Madam," replied the prince, whose weakness would hardly allow him to speak, "do not think me so unnatural as to wish to deprive my father of his crown. As long as he lives I shall remain the most faithful of his subjects! And as to the princesses you speak of, I have seen none that I should care for as a wife, though I would always obey your wishes, whatever it might cost me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='79'>"Ah! my son," cried she, "we will do anything in the world to save your life----and ours too, for if you die, we shall die also."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='80'>"Well, then," replied <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cake;thing;donkey;skin;hand' adjectives='only' verbs='reply;make;cure;tell' valence='5.83333333333' arousal='4.02066666667' dominance='5.55333333333'>the prince</entity>, "I will tell you the only thing that will cure me----a cake made by the hand of "Donkey Skin.""</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='81'>"Donkey Skin?" exclaimed <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='son' adjectives='mad' verbs='go;be;exclaim;think;have' valence='5.86' arousal='4.43428571429' dominance='5.52'>the queen</entity>, who thought her son had gone mad; "and who or what is that?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>"Madam," answered one of the attendants present, who had been with the prince at the farm, ""Donkey Skin" is, next to the wolf, the most disgusting creature on the face of the earth. She is a girl who wears a black, greasy skin, and lives at your farmer"s as hen-wife."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>"Never mind," said the queen; "my son seems to have eaten some of her pastry. It is the whim of a sick man, no doubt; but send at once and let her bake a cake."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>The attendant bowed and ordered a page to ride with the message.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='85'>Now it is by no means certain that "Donkey Skin" had not caught a glimpse of the prince, either when his eyes looked through the keyhole, or else from her little window, which was over the road. But whether she had actually seen him or only heard him spoken of, directly she received the queen"s command, she flung off the dirty skin, washed herself from head to foot, and put on a skirt and bodice of shining silver.

Perhaps "Donkey Skin" saw it, or perhaps she did not; but, any way, she went on stirring, and soon the cake was ready to be put in the oven. When it was nice and brown she took off her dress and put on her dirty skin, and gave the cake to the page, asking at the same time for news of the prince. But the page turned his head aside, and would not even condescend to answer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>The page rode like the wind, and as soon as he arrived at the palace he snatched up a silver tray and hastened to present the cake to the prince. The sick man began to eat it so fast that the doctors thought he would choke; and, indeed, he very nearly did, for the ring was in one of the bits which he broke off, though he managed to extract it from his mouth without anyone seeing him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='88'>The moment the prince was left alone he drew the ring from under his pillow and kissed it a thousand times. Then he set his mind to find how he was to see the owner---for even he did not dare to confess that he had only beheld "Donkey Skin" through a keyhole, lest they should laugh at this sudden passion. All this worry brought back the fever, which the arrival of the cake had diminished for the time; and the doctors, not knowing what else to say, informed the queen that her son was simply dying of love. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='presence;horror;son;s;bedside;news' adjectives='' verbs='stricken;rush;hasten' valence='5.09583333333' arousal='4.68583333333' dominance='5.11916666667'>The queen</entity>, stricken with horror, rushed into <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='presence;horror;son;s;bedside;news' adjectives='' verbs='stricken;rush;hasten' valence='5.09583333333' arousal='4.68583333333' dominance='5.11916666667'>the king</entity>"s presence with the news, and together they hastened to their son"s bedside.</paragraph>

When, therefore, the messenger from the palace rode up to the gate, she was nearly beside herself with delight. Hoping all the time for such a summons, she had dressed herself with great care, putting on the garment of moonlight, whose skirt was scattered over with emeralds. But when they began calling to her to come down, she hastily covered herself with her donkey-skin and announced she was ready to present herself before his Highness.

And I was thirsty and asked for water, but she had none to give me, and I felt like to die. Then she told me that the ogre, in whose castle she dwelt, brought in water always from the same side, and that if I too went that way most likely I should come to it. But before I started she begged me to go to her native town, and if I met a man called Dschemil I was to say to him, "Dschemila greets you, from the castle which lies far away, and is rocked by the wind.

"If the man was right, the castle must be somewhere about. I had better sleep here to-night, and to-morrow I shall be able to see where it is." So he slept long and peacefully. When he awoke the sun was high, and he jumped up and washed his face and hands in the spring, before going on his journey.

"I dare not knock, lest the ogre should hear me. Perhaps it would be best for me to climb up the wall, and wait to see what will happen.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='547'>But the liar, who knew his partner"s tricks, instantly suspected the truth, and said: "As he has not paid me, I will pay him out with three good lashes of my riding whip."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='548'>At these words the thief sprang to his feet, and, appearing at the door, promised his partner that if he would return the following Saturday he would pay him. So the liar went away satisfied with this promise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='549'>But when Saturday morning came the thief got up early and hid himself under a truss of hay in the hay-loft.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='550'>When the liar appeared to demand his three florins, the wife met him with tears in her eyes, and told him that her husband was dead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='551'>"Where have you buried him?" asked the liar.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='552'>"In the hay-loft," answered the wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='553'>"Then I will go there, and take away some hay in payment of his debt," said the liar. And proceeding to the hay-loft, he began to toss about the hay with a pitchfork, prodding it into the trusses of hay, till, in terror of his life, the thief crept out and promised his partner to pay him the three florins on the following Saturday.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='554'>When the day came he got up at sunrise, and going down into the crypt of a neighbouring chapel, stretched himself out quite still and stiff in an old stone coffin. But the liar, who was quite as clever as his partner, very soon bethought him of the crypt, and set out for the chapel, confident that he would shortly discover the hiding-place of his friend. He had just entered the crypt, and his eyes were not yet accustomed to the darkness, when he heard the sound of whispering at the grated windows. Listening intently, he overheard the plotting of a band of robbers, who had brought their treasure to the crypt, meaning to hide it there, while they set out on fresh adventures. All the time they were speaking they were removing the bars from the window, and in another minute they would all have entered the crypt, and discovered the liar. Quick as thought he wound his mantle round him and placed himself, standing stiff and erect, in a niche in the wall, so that in the dim light he looked just like an old stone statue. As soon as the robbers entered the crypt, they set about the work of dividing their treasure. Now, there were twelve robbers, but by mistake the chief of the band divided the gold into thirteen heaps. When he saw his mistake he said they had not time to count it all over again, but that the thirteenth heap should belong to whoever among them could strike off the head of the old stone statue in the niche with one stroke. With these words he took up an axe, and approached the niche where the liar was standing. But, just as he had waved the axe over his head ready to strike, a voice was heard from the stone coffin saying, in sepulchral tones: "Clear out of this, or the dead will arise from their coffins, and the statues will descend from the walls, and you will be driven out more dead than alive." And with a bound the thief jumped out of his coffin and the liar from his niche, and the robbers were so terrified that they ran helter-skelter out of the crypt, leaving all their gold behind them, and vowing that they would never put foot inside the haunted place again. So the partners divided the gold between them, and carried it to their homes; and history tells us no more about them.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='557'>Once upon a time there lived in the city of Famagosta, in the island of Cyprus, a rich man called Theodorus. He ought to have been the happiest person in the whole world, as he had all he could wish for, and a wife and little son whom he loved dearly; but unluckily, after a short time he always grew tired of everything, and had to seek new pleasures. When people are made like this the end is generally the same, and before <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;name;people;money;father;s;left' adjectives='farthing;same' verbs='be;make;spend;have' valence='5.7925' arousal='3.9815' dominance='5.4305'>Fortunatus</entity> (for that was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;name;people;money;father;s;left' adjectives='farthing;same' verbs='be;make;spend;have' valence='5.7925' arousal='3.9815' dominance='5.4305'>the boy</entity>"s name) was ten years old, his father had spent all his money and had not a farthing left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='558'>But though Theodorus had been so foolish he was not quite without sense, and set about getting work at once. His wife, too, instead of reproaching him sent away the servants and sold their fine horses, and did all the work of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;wife;servant;work;child;husband;clothes' adjectives='fine' verbs='sell;do;reproach;send;wash' valence='6.075' arousal='4.03' dominance='5.745'>the house</entity> herself, even washing the clothes of her husband and child.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='559'>Thus time passed till Fortunatus was sixteen. One day when they were sitting at supper, the boy said to Theodorus, "Father, why do you look so sad. Tell me what is wrong, and perhaps I can help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='560'>"Ah, my son, I have reason enough to be sad; but for me you would now have been enjoying every kind of pleasure, instead of being buried in this tiny house."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='561'>"Oh, do not let that trouble you," replied Fortunatus, "it is time I made some money for myself. To be sure I have never been taught any trade. Still there must be something I can do. I will go and walk on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='go;think;walk' valence='6.295' arousal='3.79166666667' dominance='5.87833333333'>the seashore</entity> and think about it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='562'>Very soon--sooner than he expected--a chance came, and Fortunatus, like a wise boy, seized on it at once. The post offered him was that of page to the Earl of Flanders, and as the Earl"s daughter was just going to be married, splendid festivities were held in her honour, and at some of the tilting matches Fortunatus was lucky enough to win the prize. These prizes, together with presents from the lords and ladies of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='prize;way;lord;fortunatus;lady;present;man' adjectives='pleasant;rich' verbs='feel;make;like' valence='6.23615384615' arousal='4.36230769231' dominance='5.78230769231'>the court</entity>, who liked him for his pleasant ways, made Fortunatus feel quite a rich man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='563'>But though his head was not turned by the notice taken of him, it excited the envy of some of the other pages about the Court, and one of them, called Robert, invented a plot to move Fortunatus out of his way. So he told the young man that the Earl had taken a dislike to him and meant to kill him; <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='earl;story;money;dislike;man;dawn;clothes' adjectives='fine;young' verbs='slip;pack;kill;take;have;believe;tell;mean' valence='5.36833333333' arousal='4.305' dominance='5.28777777778'>Fortunatus</entity> believed the story, and packing up his fine clothes and money, slipped away before dawn.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='564'>He went to a great many big towns and lived well, and as he was generous and not wiser than most youths of his age, he very soon found himself penniless. Like his father, he then began to think of work, and tramped half over Brittany in search of it. Nobody seemed to want him, and he wandered about from one place to another, till he found himself in a dense wood, without any paths, and not much light. Here he spent two whole days, with nothing to eat and very little water to drink, going first in one direction and then in another, but never being able to find his way out. During the first night he slept soundly, and was too tired to fear either man or beast, but when darkness came on for the second time, and growls were heard in the distance, he grew frightened and looked about for a high tree out of reach of his enemies. Hardly had he settled himself comfortably in one of the forked branches, when a lion walked up to a spring that burst from a rock close to the tree, and crouching down drank greedily. This was bad enough, but after all, lions do not climb trees, and as long as Fortunatus stayed up on his perch, he was quite safe. But no sooner was the lion out of sight, than his place was taken by a bear, and bears, as Fortunatus knew very well, are tree-climbers. His heart beat fast, and not without reason, for as the bear turned away he looked up and saw Fortunatus!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='565'>Now in those days every young man carried a sword slung to his belt, and it was a fashion that came in very handily for Fortunatus. He drew his sword, and when the bear got within a yard of him he made a fierce lunge forward. The bear, wild with pain, tried to spring, but the bough he was standing on broke with his weight, and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Fortunatus descended from his tree (first taking good care to see no other wild animals were in sight) and killed him with a single blow. He was just thinking he would light a fire and make a hearty dinner off bear"s flesh, which is not at all bad eating, when he beheld a beautiful lady standing by his side leaning on a wheel, and her eyes hidden by a bandage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='566'>"I am Dame Fortune," she said, "and I have a gift for you. Shall it be wisdom, strength, long life, riches, health, or beauty? Think well, and tell me what you will have."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='568'>And the lady held out a purse and told him he had only to put his hand into it, and he and his children would always find ten pieces of gold. But when they were dead it would be a magic purse no longer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='569'>At this news Fortunatus was beside himself with joy, and could hardly find words to thank the lady. But she told him that the best thing he could do was to find his way out of the wood, and before bidding him farewell pointed out which path he should take. He walked along it as fast as his weakness would let him, until a welcome light at a little distance showed him that a house was near. It turned out to be an inn, but before entering Fortunatus thought he had better make sure of the truth of what the lady had told him, and took out the purse and looked inside. Sure enough there were the ten pieces of gold, shining brightly. Then Fortunatus walked boldly up to the inn, and ordered them to get ready a good supper at once, as he was very hungry, and to bring him the best wine in the house. And he seemed to care so little what he spent that everybody thought he was a great lord, and vied with each other who should run quickest when he called.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='570'>After a night passed in a soft bed, Fortunatus felt so much better that he asked the landlord if he could find him some men-servants, and tell him where any good horses were to be got. The next thing was to provide himself with smart clothes, and then to take a big house where he could give great feasts to the nobles and beautiful ladies who lived in palaces round about.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='571'>In this manner a whole year soon slipped away, and Fortunatus was so busy amusing himself that he never once remembered his parents whom he had left behind in Cyprus. But though he was thoughtless, he was not bad-hearted. As soon as their existence crossed his mind, he set about making preparations to visit them, and as he was not fond of being alone he looked round for some one older and wiser than himself to travel with him. It was not long before he had the good luck to come across an old man who had left his wife and children in a far country many years before, when he went out into the world to seek the fortune which he never found. He agreed to accompany Fortunatus back to Cyprus, but only on condition he should first be allowed to return for a few weeks to his own home before venturing to set sail for an island so strange and distant. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='proposal;anything' adjectives='new;fond' verbs='go;be;say;agree' valence='6.42625' arousal='4.16' dominance='6.1075'>Fortunatus</entity> agreed to his proposal, and as he was always fond of anything new, said that he would go with him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='572'>The journey was long, and they had to cross many large rivers, and climb over high mountains, and find their way through thick woods, before they reached at length the old man"s castle. His wife and children had almost given up hopes of seeing him again, and crowded eagerly round him. Indeed, it did not take Fortunatus five minutes to fall in love with the youngest daughter, the most beautiful creature in the whole world, whose name was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;name;world;love;fortunatus;creature' adjectives='youngest;beautiful;whole' verbs='do;be;take;fall' valence='5.96461538462' arousal='4.23692307692' dominance='5.29230769231'>Cassandra</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='573'>"Give her to me for my wife," he said to the old man, "and let us all go together to Famagosta."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='574'>So a ship was bought big enough to hold Fortunatus, the old man and his wife, and their ten children--five of them sons and five daughters. And the day before they sailed the wedding was celebrated with magnificent rejoicings, and everybody thought that Fortunatus must certainly be a prince in disguise. But when they reached Cyprus, he learned to his sorrow that both his father and mother were dead, and for some time he shut himself up in his house and would see nobody, full of shame at having forgotten them all these years. Then he begged that the old man and his wife would remain with him, and take the place of his parents.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='575'>For twelve years Fortunatus and Cassandra and their two little boys lived happily in Famagosta. They had a beautiful house and everything they could possibly want, and when Cassandra"s sisters married the purse provided them each with a fortune. But at last Fortunatus grew tired of staying at home, and thought he should like to go out and see the world again. Cassandra shed many tears at first when he told her of his wishes, and he had a great deal of trouble to persuade her to give her consent. But on his promising to return at the end of two years she agreed to let him go. Before he went away he showed her three chests of gold, which stood in a room with an iron door, and walls twelve feet thick. "If anything should happen to me," he said, "and I should never come back, keep one of the chests for yourself, and give the others to our two sons." Then he embraced them all and took ship for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ship' adjectives='' verbs='embrace;take' valence='5.98666666667' arousal='4.76' dominance='5.75'>Alexandria</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='576'>Filled with delight at feeling himself free to roam through the world once more, Fortunatus set out on his journey without losing a day. From court to court he went, astonishing everyone by the magnificence of his dress and the splendour of his presents. At length he grew as tired of wandering as he had been of staying at home, and returned to Alexandria, where he found the same ship that had brought him from Cyprus lying in the harbour. Of course the first thing he did was to pay his respects to the Sultan, who was eager to hear about his adventures.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='577'>When Fortunatus had told them all, the Sultan observed: "Well, you have seen many wonderful things, but I have something to show you more wonderful still;" and he led him into a room where precious stones lay heaped against the walls.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='585'>Fortunatus took the cap and put it on his head, and then, without thinking, wished himself back in the ship that was starting for Famagosta.

In a moment Renzolla"s pretty mouth stretched out into a snout, with a beard a yard long at the end of it, her cheeks sank in, and her shining plaits of hair changed into two sharp horns. When the king turned round and saw her he thought he must have taken leave of his senses. He burst into tears, and cried out: "Where is the hair that bound me so tightly, where are the eyes that pierced through my heart, and where are the lips I kissed?

If he wants shirts he can buy them. It isn"t even as if he had picked me out of the gutter, for he ought to remember that I brought him seven thousand golden guineas as my wedding portion, and that I am his wife and not his slave.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='624'>What Came of Picking Flowers</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='625'>There was once a woman who had three daughters whom she loved very much. One day the eldest was walking in a water-meadow, when she saw a pink growing in the stream. She stooped to pick the flower, but her hand had scarcely touched it, when she vanished altogether. The next morning the second sister went out into the meadow, to see if she could find any traces of the lost girl, and as a branch of lovely roses lay trailing across her path, she bent down to move it away, and in so doing, could not resist plucking one of the roses. In a moment she too had disappeared. Wondering what could have become of her two sisters, the youngest followed in their footsteps, and fell a victim to a branch of delicious white jessamine. So the old woman was left without any daughters at all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='626'>She wept, and wept, and wept, all day and all night, and went on weeping so long, that her son, who had been a little boy when his sisters disappeared, grew up to be a tall youth. Then one night he asked his mother to tell him what was the matter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='627'>When he had heard the whole story, he said, "Give me your blessing, mother, and I will go and search the world till I find them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='628'>So he set forth, and after he had travelled several miles without any adventures, he came upon three big boys fighting in the road. He stopped and inquired what they were fighting about, and one of them answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='629'>"My lord! our father left to us, when he died, a pair of boots, a key, and a cap. Whoever puts on the boots and wishes himself in any place, will find himself there. The key will open every door in the world, and with the cap on your head no one can see you. Now our eldest brother wants to have all three things for himself, and we wish to draw lots for them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='630'>"Oh, that is easily settled," said the youth. "I will throw this stone as far as I can, and the one who picks it up first, shall have the three things." So he took the stone and flung it, and while the three brothers were running after it, he drew hastily on the boots, and said, "Boots, take me to the place where I shall find my eldest sister."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='631'>The next moment the young man was standing on a steep mountain before the gates of a strong castle guarded by bolts and bars and iron chains. The key, which he had not forgotten to put in his pocket, opened the doors one by one, and he walked through a number of halls and corridors, till he met a beautiful and richly-dressed young lady who started back in surprise at the sight of him, and exclaimed, "Oh, sir, how did you contrive _to_ get in here?" The young man replied that he was her brother, and told her by what means he had been able to pass through the doors. In return, she told him how happy she was, except for one thing, and that was, her husband lay under a spell, and could never break it till there should be put to death a man who could not die.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='632'>They talked together for a long time, and then the lady said he had better leave her as she expected her husband back at any moment, and he might not like him to be there; but the young man assured her she need not be afraid, as he had with him a cap which would make him invisible. They were still deep in conversation when the door suddenly opened, and a bird flew in, but he saw nothing unusual, for, at the first noise, the youth had put on his cap. The lady jumped up and brought a large golden basin, into which the bird flew, reappearing directly after as a handsome man. Turning to his wife, he cried, "I am sure someone is in the room!" She got frightened, and declared that she was quite alone, but her husband persisted, and in the end she had to confess the truth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='633'>"But if he is really your brother, why did you hide him?" asked he. "I believe you are telling me a lie, and if he comes back I shall kill him!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='634'>At this the youth took off his cap, and came forward. Then the husband saw that he was indeed so like his wife that he doubted her word no longer, and embraced his brother-in-law with delight. Drawing a feather from his bird"s skin, he said, "If you are in danger and cry, "Come and help me, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='danger;cry;birds;everything;s;skin;feather;bird' adjectives='' verbs='be;draw;help;say;go;come' valence='5.513125' arousal='4.261875' dominance='5.44375'>King</entity> of the Birds," everything will go well with you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='635'>The young man thanked him and went away, and after he had left the castle he told the boots that they must take him to the place where his second sister was living. As before, he found himself at the gates of a huge castle, and within was his second sister, very happy with her husband, who loved her dearly, but longing for the moment when he should be set free from the spell that kept him half his life a fish. When he arrived and had been introduced by his wife to her brother, he welcomed him warmly, and gave him a fish-scale, saying, "If you are in danger, call to me, "Come and help me, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everything;danger;brother;wife' adjectives='fish-scale' verbs='be;help;give;welcome;introduce;say;call;have;go;arrive;come' valence='5.92' arousal='4.279' dominance='5.7375'>King</entity> of the Fishes," and everything will go well with you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='636'>The young man thanked him and took his leave, and when he was outside the gates he told the boots to take him to the place where his youngest sister lived. The boots carried him to a dark cavern, with steps of iron leading up to it. Inside she sat, weeping and sobbing, and as she had done nothing else the whole time she had been there, the poor girl had grown very thin. When she saw a man standing before her, she sprang to her feet and exclaimed, "Oh, whoever you are, save me and take me from this horrible place!" Then he told her who he was, and how he had seen her sisters, whose happiness was spoilt by the spell under which both their husbands lay, and she, in turn, related her story. She had been carried off in the water-meadow by a horrible monster, who wanted to make her marry him by force, and had kept her a prisoner all these years because she would not submit to his will. Every day he came to beg her to consent to his wishes, and to remind her that there was no hope of her being set free, as he was the most constant man in the world, and besides that he could never die. At these words the youth remembered his two enchanted brothers-in-law, and he advised his sister to promise to marry the old man, if he would tell her why he could never die. Suddenly everything began to tremble, as if it was shaken by a whirlwind, and the old man entered, and flinging himself at the feet of the girl, he said: "Are you still determined never to marry me? If so you will have to sit there weeping till the end of the world, for I shall always be faithful to my wish to marry you!" "Well, I will marry you," she said, "if you will tell me why it is that you can never die."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='637'>Then the old man burst into peals of laughter. "Ah, ah, ah! You are thinking how you would be able to kill me? Well, to do that, you would have to find an iron casket which lies at the bottom of the sea, and has a white dove inside, and then you would have to find the egg which the dove laid, and bring it here, and dash it against my head." And he laughed again in his certainty that no one had ever got down to the bottom of the sea, and that if they did, they would never find the casket, or be able to open it. When he could speak once more, he said, "Now you will be obliged to marry me, as you know my secret." But she begged so hard that the wedding might be put off for three days, that he consented, and went away rejoicing at his victory. When he had disappeared, the brother took off the cap which had kept him invisible all this time, and told his sister not to lose heart as he hoped in three days she would be free. Then he drew on his boots, and wished himself at the seashore, and there he was directly. Drawing out the fish-scale, he cried, "Come and help me, King of the Fishes!" and his brother-in-law swam up, and asked what he could do. The young man related the story, and when he had finished his listener summoned all the fishes to his presence. The last to arrive was a little sardine, who apologised for being so late, but said she had hurt herself by knocking her head against an iron casket that lay in the bottom of the sea. The king ordered several of the largest and strongest of his subjects to take the little sardine as a guide, and bring him the iron casket. They soon returned with the box placed across their backs and laid it down before him. Then the youth produced the key and said "Key, open that box!" and the key opened it, and though they were all crowding round, ready to catch it, the white dove within flew away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='638'>It was useless to go after it, and for a moment the young man"s heart sank. The next minute, however, he remembered that he had still his feather, and drew it out crying, "Come to me, King of the Birds!" and a rushing noise was heard, and the King of the Birds perched on his shoulder, and asked what he could do to help him. His brother-in-law told him the whole story, and when he had finished the King of the Birds commanded all his subjects to hasten to his presence. In an instant the air was dark with birds of all sizes, and at the very last came the white dove, apologising for being so late by saying that an old friend had arrived at his nest, and he had been obliged to give him some dinner. The King of the Birds ordered some of them to show the young man the white dove"s nest, and when they reached it, there lay the egg which was to break the spell and set them all free. When it was safely in his pocket, he told the boots to carry him straight to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pocket;sister;boot' adjectives='youngest' verbs='carry;be;await;tell;sit' valence='5.80111111111' arousal='3.59666666667' dominance='5.28888888889'>the cavern</entity> where his youngest sister sat awaiting him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='639'>Now it was already far on into the third day, which the old man had fixed for the wedding, and when the youth reached the cavern with his cap on his head, he found the monster there, urging the girl to keep her word and let the marriage take place at once. At a sign from her brother she sat down and invited the old monster to lay his head on her lap. He did so with delight, and her brother standing behind her back passed her the egg unseen. She took it, and dashed it straight at the horrible head, and the monster started, and with a groan that people took for the rumblings of an earthquake, he turned over and died.</paragraph>

But scarcely had the river closed above his head when such dreadful rushing sounds and peals of thunder came crashing round about him that he lost all his courage, and rang his bell, if perchance it might be heard amidst all this clamour. Great was his relief when the rope began slowly to pull him upwards.</paragraph>

And when he heard the thunder and clamour round about him he thought to himself, "Oh, make as much noise as you like, it won"t hurt me!" When his feet touched the bottom he found himself in a large, brilliantly lighted hall, and in the middle sat the eldest princess, and in front of her lay a huge giant, fast asleep. Directly she saw <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye' adjectives='' verbs='nod;ask;see;come;have' valence='5.53833333333' arousal='3.475' dominance='5.77666666667'>Bensurdatu</entity> she nodded to him, and asked with her eyes how he had come there.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='678'>So he turned over and went to sleep.

And the heart of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;head;crown;deliverer' adjectives='golden' verbs='call;leap;place' valence='6.23111111111' arousal='4.39111111111' dominance='5.61'>the princess</entity> leapt within her, and she placed a golden crown on the head of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='heart;head;crown;deliverer' adjectives='golden' verbs='call;leap;place' valence='6.23111111111' arousal='4.39111111111' dominance='5.61'>Bensurdatu</entity>, and called him her deliverer.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='680'>So the princess opened a door, and led him into another hall, wherein sat her next sister, guarded by a giant who was fast asleep.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='682'>"Now, how could any man get down here?" asked she; "go to sleep again."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='685'>"Take me to him," replied Bensurdatu. "It will be a splendid fight."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='686'>Then the princess opened a door, and Bensurdatu passed through, and found himself in a hall that was even larger than the other two. And there stood the youngest sister, chained fast to the wall, and before her was stretched a serpent with seven heads, horrible to see. As Bensurdatu came forward it twisted all its seven heads in his direction, and then made a quick dart to snatch him within its grasp. But Bensurdatu drew his sword and laid about him, till the seven heads were rolling on the floor. Flinging down his sword he rushed to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;chain;joy;crown;hand;sword' adjectives='golden' verbs='rush;fling;break;embrace;take;place;weep' valence='5.79' arousal='4.816' dominance='5.678'>the princess</entity> and broke her chains, and she wept for joy, and embraced him, and took the golden crown from off her head, and placed it in his hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='687'>"Now we must go back to the upper world," said Bensurdatu, and led her to the bottom of the river. The other princesses were waiting there, and he tied the rope round the eldest, and rung his bell. And the generals above heard, and drew her gently up. They then unfastened the cord and threw it back into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cord;sister;moment;princess' adjectives='few' verbs='throw;unfasten;stand' valence='5.865' arousal='4.044' dominance='5.527'>the river</entity>, and in a few moments the second princess stood beside her sister.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='688'>So now there were left only Bensurdatu and the youngest princess. "Dear Bensurdatu," said she, "do me a kindness, and let them draw you up before me. I dread the treachery of the generals.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='690'>"If it is your wish I will go up then; but first I swear that if you do not follow to marry me, I shall stay single for the rest of my life." Then he bound the rope round her, and the generals drew her up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='691'>But instead of lowering the rope again into the river, envy at the courage and success of Bensurdatu so filled the hearts of the two generals, that they turned away and left him to perish. And, more than that, they threatened the princesses, and forced them to promise to tell their parents that it was the two generals who had set them free. "And if they should ask you about <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everything;life;court;princess' adjectives='' verbs='see;ride;add;say;promise;have;ask;fear' valence='5.70076923077' arousal='4.35384615385' dominance='5.58461538462'>Bensurdatu</entity>, you must say you have never seen him," they added; and the princesses, fearing for their lives, promised everything, and they rode back to court together.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='692'>The king and queen were beside themselves with joy when they saw their dear children once more.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='693'>And now we must see what poor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='poor' verbs='be;see;do' valence='5.396' arousal='3.954' dominance='5.382'>Bensurdatu</entity> was doing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='694'>He waited patiently a long, long time, but when the rope never came back he knew he had been right, and that his comrades had betrayed him. "Ah, now I shall never reach the world again," murmured he; but being a brave man, and knowing that moaning his fate would profit him nothing, he rose and began to search through the three halls, where, perhaps, he might find something to help him. In the last one stood a dish, covered with food, which reminded him that he was hungry, and he sat down and ate and drank.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='695'>Months passed away, when, one morning, as he was walking through the halls, he noticed a purse hanging on the wall, which had never been there before. He took it down to examine it, and nearly let it fall with surprise when a voice came from the purse saying: "What commands have you?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='697'>"Now let me have the most beautiful ship that ever was built, all manned and ready for sea." And there was the ship, with a flag floating from its mast on which were the words, "King with the three crowns." Then Bensurdatu climbed on board, and sailed away to the city where the three princesses dwelt; and when he reached the harbour he blew trumpets and beat drums, so that every one ran to the doors and windows. And the king heard too, and saw the beautiful vessel, and said to himself: "That must indeed be a mighty monarch, for he has three crowns while I have only one." So he hastened to greet the stranger, and invited him to his castle, for, thought he, "this will be a fine husband for my youngest daughter." Now, the youngest princess had never married, and had turned a deaf ear to all her wooers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='698'>Such a long time had passed since Bensurdatu had left the palace, that the king never guessed for a moment that the splendidly clad stranger before him was the man whom he had so deeply mourned as dead.

The prince entered the open door and wandered through the deserted rooms without seeing a living soul. At last he came on a great hall, and in the centre of the hall was a table spread with dainty dishes and choice wines. The prince sat down, and satisfied his hunger and thirst, and immediately afterwards the table disappeared from his sight. This struck the prince as very strange; but though he continued his search through all the rooms, upstairs and down, he could find no one to speak to.

And the horse said to him: "Saddle and bridle me, and then go into the next room and you will find a suit of armour and a sword. Put them on, and we will ride forth together to battle."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='754'>And the prince did as he was told; and when he had mounted the horse his armour glittered in the sun, and he looked so brave and handsome, that no one would have recognised him as the gardener who swept away the dead leaves from the paths.

But when the warrior on his black charger and in glittering armour appeared on the scene, hewing right and left with his sword, the enemy were dismayed and fled in all directions, leaving the king master of the field. Then the king and his two sons-in-law, when they saw their deliverer, shouted, and all that was left of the army joined in the cry: "A god has come to our rescue!"

When they were out of sight the prince betook himself to the vaulted chamber by the brook-side, and having taken counsel of the faithful black horse, he put on the glittering suit of armour, and was borne on the back of the horse through the air, to where the battle was being fought. And once more he routed the king"s enemies, hacking to right and left with his sword. And again they all cried: "A god has come to our rescue!"

But it happened that one of the enemy struck with his sword and wounded the prince in the leg. And the king took his own pocket-handkerchief, with his name and crown embroidered on it, and bound it round the wounded leg. And the king would fain have compelled him to mount in a litter and be carried straight to the palace, and two of his knights were to lead the black charger to the royal stables. But the prince put his hand on the mane of his faithful horse, and managed to pull himself up into the saddle, and the horse mounted into the air with him.

Then he saw that she was dead, and rushed down to his brothers in the courtyard and called out, "Come quickly, our sister is dead!" In a moment they were all beside her and knew that it was true, and they made a bier and laid her on it, and placed her across a camel, and said to the camel, "Take her to her mother, but be careful not to halt by the way, and let no man capture you, and see you kneel down before no man, save him who shall say "string" [Footnote: "Riemen."] to you.

The camel caught the word "string" and knelt down at once, and the men came up and found a dead girl lying on a bier, with a ring on her finger.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1347'>Neangir consented, and the two walked together through several streets till they reached the house recommended by the Jewish merchant. By his advice the young man paid in advance the last gold piece that remained to him for his food and lodging.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1348'>As soon as Neangir had dined he shut himself up in his room, and thrusting his hand into the folds of his turban, drew out his beloved portrait. As he did so, he touched a sealed letter which had apparently been hidden there without his knowledge, and seeing it was written by his foster-mother, Zinebi, he tore it eagerly open. Judge of his surprise when he read these words:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1349'>"My dearest Child,--This letter, which you will some day find in your turban, is to inform you that you are not really our son. We believe your father to have been a great lord in some distant land, and inside this packet is a letter from him, threatening to be avenged on us if you are not restored to him at once. We shall always love you, but do not seek us or even write to us. It will be useless."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1350'>In the same wrapper was a roll of paper with a few words as follows, traced in a hand unknown to Neangir:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1353'>To shake off these gloomy feelings, so as to be able to make some plans for the future, Neangir left the house and walked briskly about the city till darkness had fallen. He then retraced his steps and was just crossing the threshold when he saw something at his feet sparkling in the moonlight. He picked it up, and discovered it to be a gold watch shining with precious stones. He gazed up and down the street to see if there was anyone about to whom it might belong, but there was not a creature visible. So he put it in his sash, by the side of a silver watch which he had bought from the Jew that morning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1354'>The possession of this piece of good fortune cheered Neangir up a little, "for," thought he, "I can sell these jewels for at least a thousand sequins, and that will certainly last me till I have found my father." And consoled by this reflection he laid both watches beside him and prepared to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1355'>In the middle of the night he awoke suddenly and heard a soft voice speaking, which seemed to come from one of the watches.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1360'>Filled with astonishment Neangir sat up in bed, and beheld by the light of the moon the two watches slide to the ground and roll out of the room past the cats" quarters. He rushed towards the door and on to the staircase, but the watches slipped downstairs without his seeing them, and into the street. He tried to unlock <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bed;chase' adjectives='key' verbs='refuse;give;try;turn;unlock;go;follow' valence='5.5225' arousal='3.95583333333' dominance='5.69916666667'>the door</entity> and follow them, but the key refused to turn, so he gave up the chase and went back to bed.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1367'>When the Cadi was informed of what had taken place he ordered the crowd to be dispersed by blows, after the Turkish manner, and then asked Neangir to state his complaint. After hearing the young man"s story, which seemed to him most extraordinary, he turned to question the Jewish merchant, who instead of answering raised his eyes to heaven and fell down in a dead faint.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1368'>The judge took no notice of the swooning man, but told Neangir that his tale was so singular he really could not believe it, and that he should have the merchant carried back to his own house.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1369'>"You see for yourself," said the Jew to the Cadi, "that this young man is out of his mind. I forgive him his blow, but do not, I pray you, leave me in his power."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1370'>At that moment the Bassa chanced to pass the Cadi"s house, and hearing a great noise, entered to inquire the cause.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1372'>At these words the Bassa rent his robe for joy, and embracing Neangir, he cried, "Oh, my son, my son, have I found you at last?

You know," he continued, addressing the Cadi, "that during the first years of my marriage I had three sons by the beautiful Zambac. When he was three years old a holy dervish gave the eldest a string of the finest coral, saying "Keep this treasure carefully, and be faithful to the Prophet, and you will be happy." To the second, who now stands before you, he presented a copper plate on which the name of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='copper;dervish;name;language;plate;joy;sorrow;bracelet;believer;sign;part;turban;prayer;hand;arm' adjectives='right;spotless;greatest;pure;true;left' verbs='be;clasp;taste;stand;engrave;tell;present;know' valence='5.78771428571' arousal='3.94314285714' dominance='5.83885714286'>Mahomet</entity> was engraved in seven languages, telling him never to part from his turban, which was the sign of a true believer, and he would taste the greatest of all joys; while on the right arm of the third the dervish clasped a bracelet with the prayer that his right hand should be pure and the left spotless, so that he might never know sorrow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1375'>"My eldest son neglected the counsel of the dervish and terrible troubles fell on him, as also on the youngest. To preserve the second from similar misfortunes I brought him up in a lonely place, under the care of a faithful servant named Gouloucou, while I was fighting the enemies of our Holy Faith. On my return from the wars I hastened to embrace my son, but both he and Gouloucou had vanished, and it is only a few months since that I learned that the boy was living with a man called Mohammed, whom I suspected of having stolen him. Tell me, my son, how it came about that you fell into his hands."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1376'>"My lord," replied Neangir, "I can remember little of the early years of my life, save that I dwelt in a castle by the seashore with an old servant. I must have been about twelve years old when one day as we were out walking we met a man whose face was like that of this Jew, coming dancing towards us. Suddenly I felt myself growing faint. I tried to raise my hands to my head, but they had become stiff and hard. In a word, I had been changed into a copper pot, and my arms formed the handle.

She tied it firmly round the lid, and then left the room. For the first time during three years I began to feel the fire burning the soles of my feet, and moved away a little--doing this with a great deal more ease than I had felt when making my escape to Mohammed"s garden.

For two years more I lived with them, and was treated like their own son, till the day when they sent me to this city to seek my fortune.

In one hand she held two crutches of white wood, and was followed by two men. The first man Neangir knew to be the brother of the Jew he had struck with his sword, while in the second the young man thought he recognised the person who was standing by when he was changed into a pot.

It was, he said, Thelamis"s idea to disguise him like this, and that he himself had assumed the character of a slave-dealer who was taking this peerless maiden as a present to the Sultan. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='box;caravan;window;charge;officer;approach' adjectives='own;ours;vacant;easy' verbs='be;hire;persuade;let;have;scramble' valence='5.74266666667' arousal='3.89933333333' dominance='5.50266666667'>Thelamis</entity> had also persuaded the officer in charge of the caravan to let him hire the vacant box, so it was easy for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='box;caravan;window;charge;officer;approach' adjectives='own;ours;vacant;easy' verbs='be;hire;persuade;let;have;scramble' valence='5.74266666667' arousal='3.89933333333' dominance='5.50266666667'>the prince</entity> to scramble out of his own window and approach ours.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1503'>"The sun had set before we quitted the inn, and we had made no plans as to where we should go next, so we readily consented to the prince"s proposal that we should embark without delay for the Isle of Black Marble. What a place it was! Rocks blacker than jet towered above its shores and shed thick darkness over the country. Our sailors had not been there before and were nearly as frightened as ourselves, but thanks to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sailor;thanks;pilot' adjectives='' verbs='be;land;undertake;have;frighten' valence='5.88272727273' arousal='4.11909090909' dominance='5.55363636364'>Thelamis</entity>, who undertook to be our pilot, we landed safely on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sailor;thanks;pilot' adjectives='' verbs='be;land;undertake;have;frighten' valence='5.88272727273' arousal='4.11909090909' dominance='5.55363636364'>the beach</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1504'>"When we had left the coast behind us, with its walls of jet, we entered a lovely country where the fields were greener, the streams clearer, and the sun brighter than anywhere else. The people crowded round to welcome their prince, whom they loved dearly, but they told him that the king was still full of rage at his son"s refusal to marry his cousin the Princess Okimpare, and also at his flight. Indeed, they all begged him not to visit the capital, as his life would hardly be safe. So, much as I should have enjoyed seeing <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='palace;advice;middle;s;forest;prince' adjectives='wise;vast;beloved' verbs='enjoy;implore;see;let;have;go;listen' valence='6.0315' arousal='4.317' dominance='5.6465'>the home</entity> of my beloved prince, I implored him to listen to this wise advice and to let us all go to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='palace;advice;middle;s;forest;prince' adjectives='wise;vast;beloved' verbs='enjoy;implore;see;let;have;go;listen' valence='6.0315' arousal='4.317' dominance='5.6465'>Thelamis</entity>"s palace in the middle of a vast forest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1505'>"To my sister and myself, who had been brought up in a cottage, this house of Thelamis"s seemed like fairyland. It was built of pink marble, so highly polished that the flowers and streams surrounding it were reflected as in a mirror. One set of rooms was furnished especially for me in yellow silk and silver, to suit my black hair. Fresh dresses were provided for us every day, and we had slaves to wait on us. Ah, why could not this happiness have lasted for ever!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1506'>"The peace of our lives was troubled by Thelamis"s jealousy of my sister, as he could not endure to see her on friendly terms with the prince, though knowing full well that his heart was mine.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1507'>"We had been living in this way for some months when one day the news came that the king had fallen dangerously ill. I begged the prince to hurry at once to the Court, both to see his father and also to show himself to the senators and nobles, but as his love for me was greater than his desire of a crown, he hesitated as if foreseeing all that afterwards happened. At last Tezila spoke to him so seriously in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;presence' adjectives='tezila;last' verbs='go;return;promise;determine;speak' valence='6.01777777778' arousal='4.1' dominance='5.80444444444'>Thelamis</entity>"s presence, that he determined to go, but promised that he would return before night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1508'>"Night came but no prince, and Tezila, who had been the cause of his departure, showed such signs of uneasiness that Thelamis"s jealousy was at once awakened. As for me, I cannot tell what I suffered. Not being able to sleep I rose from my bed and wandered into the forest, along the road which he had taken so many hours before. Suddenly I heard in the distance the sound of a horse"s hoofs, and in a few moments the prince had flung himself down and was by my side. "Ah, how I adore you!" he exclaimed; "Thelamis"s love will never equal mine." The words were hardly out of his mouth when I heard a slight noise behind, and before we could turn round both our heads were rolling in front of us, while the voice of Thelamis cried:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1509'>""Perjured wretches, answer me; and you, faithless <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wretch' adjectives='faithless;perjured' verbs='answer;tell;have;betray' valence='4.917' arousal='4.506' dominance='5.123'>Tezila</entity>, tell me why you have betrayed me like this?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1510'>"Then I understood what had happened, and that, in his rage, he had mistaken me for my sister.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1511'>""Alas," replied my head in weak tones, "I am not Tezila, but Dely, whose life you have destroyed, as well as that of your friend." At this Thelamis paused and seemed to reflect for an instant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1512'>""Be not frightened," he said more quietly, "I can make you whole again," and laying a magic powder on our tongues he placed our heads on our necks. In the twinkling of an eye our heads were joined to our bodies without leaving so much as a scar; only that, blinded with rage as he still was, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;head;eye;rage;mine;twinkling;s;scar' adjectives='' verbs='blind;be;join;leave;place;have' valence='5.21333333333' arousal='4.52333333333' dominance='5.15111111111'>Thelamis</entity> had placed my head on <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;head;eye;rage;mine;twinkling;s;scar' adjectives='' verbs='blind;be;join;leave;place;have' valence='5.21333333333' arousal='4.52333333333' dominance='5.15111111111'>the prince</entity>"s body, and his on mine!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1513'>"I cannot describe to you how odd we both felt at this strange transformation. We both instinctively put up our hands--he to feel his hair, which was, of course, dressed like a woman"s, and I to raise the turban which pressed heavily on my forehead. But we did not know what had happened to us, for the night was still dark.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1514'>"At this point Tezila appeared, followed by a troop of slaves bearing flowers. It was only by the light of their torches that we understood what had occurred. Indeed the first thought of both of us was that we must have changed clothes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1515'>"Now in spite of what we may say, we all prefer our own bodies to those of anybody else, so notwithstanding our love for each other, at first we could not help feeling a little cross with Thelamis. However, so deep was the prince"s passion for me, that very soon he began to congratulate himself on the change. "My happiness is perfect," he said; "my heart, beautiful <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;head;happiness' adjectives='perfect;beautiful' verbs='be;say;have' valence='6.46181818182' arousal='4.52454545455' dominance='5.91454545455'>Dely</entity>, has always been yours, and now I have your head also."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1516'>"But though the prince made the best of it, Thelamis was much ashamed of his stupidity. "I have," he said hesitatingly, "two other pastilles which have the same magic properties as those I used before. Let me cut off your heads again, and that will put matters straight." The proposal sounded tempting, but was a little risky, and after consulting together we decided to let things remain as they were. "Do not blame me then," continued Thelamis, "if you will not accept my offer. But take the two pastilles, and if it ever happens that you are decapitated a second time, make use of them in the way I have shown you, and each will get back his own head." So saying he presented us with the pastilles, and we all returned to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pastille' adjectives='' verbs='say;return;present' valence='6.2825' arousal='4.315' dominance='6.3975'>the castle</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1517'>"However, the troubles caused by the unfortunate exchange were only just beginning. My head, without thinking what it was doing, led the prince"s body to my apartments. But my women, only looking at the dress, declared I had mistaken the corridor, and called some slaves to conduct me to his highness"s rooms. This was bad enough, but when--as it was still night my servants began to undress me, I nearly fainted from surprise and confusion, and no doubt <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;end;servant;confusion;undress;doubt;manner;surprise' adjectives='bad;other;same' verbs='suffer;be;begin;faint;s' valence='5.175' arousal='4.33409090909' dominance='4.835'>the prince</entity>"s head was suffering in the same manner at the other end of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;end;servant;confusion;undress;doubt;manner;surprise' adjectives='bad;other;same' verbs='suffer;be;begin;faint;s' valence='5.175' arousal='4.33409090909' dominance='4.835'>the castle</entity>!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1518'>"By the next morning--you will easily guess that we slept but little--we had grown partly accustomed to our strange situation, and when we looked in the mirror, the prince had become brown-skinned and black-haired, while my head was covered with his curly golden locks. And after that first day, everyone in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='everyone;change' adjectives='accustomed' verbs='become;think;have' valence='6.26' arousal='4.05' dominance='5.89'>the palace</entity> had become so accustomed to the change that they thought no more about it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1519'>"Some weeks after this, we heard that the king of the Isle of Black Marble was dead. The prince"s head, which once was mine, was full of ambitious desires, and he longed to ride straight to the capital and proclaim himself king. But then came the question as to whether the nobles would recognise <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;noble;question;s;girl;prince' adjectives='' verbs='be;come;think;recognise' valence='6.05866666667' arousal='4.31666666667' dominance='5.53266666667'>the prince</entity> with a girl"s body, and indeed, when we came to think of it, which was prince and which was girl?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1520'>"At last, after much argument, my head carried the day and we set out; but only to find that the king had declared the Princess Okimpare his successor.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1521'>"A few days later Tezila and Thelamis, who had followed us to the capital, came to tell us that the new queen had accused us of high treason, and had herself been present at our trial--which was conducted without us. They had been in mortal terror as to what would be our sentence, but by a piece of extraordinary luck we had been condemned to be beheaded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1522'>"I told my sister that I did not see exactly where the luck came in, but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sister;luck' adjectives='' verbs='interrupt;do;see;come;tell' valence='5.458' arousal='4.279' dominance='5.381'>Thelamis</entity> interrupted me rudely:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1524'>"The square was crowded with people of all ages and all ranks, and in the middle a platform had been erected on which was the scaffold, with the executioner, in a black mask, standing by. At a sign from him I mounted first, and in a moment my head was rolling at his feet. With a bound my sister and Thelamis were beside me, and like lightning Thelamis seized the sabre from the headsman, and cut off the head of the prince. And before the multitude had recovered from their astonishment at these strange proceedings, our bodies were joined to our right heads, and the pastilles placed on our tongues. Then Thelamis led <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;platform;edge;thelamis;people' adjectives='lawful' verbs='say;present;lead;behold' valence='5.763' arousal='4.298' dominance='5.71'>the prince</entity> to the edge of the platform and presented him to the people, saying, "Behold your lawful king."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1525'>"Shouts of joy rent the air at the sound of Thelamis"s words, and the noise reached Okimpare in the palace.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1526'>"Meanwhile our happiness was all turned to sorrow.

The Bassa granted the holy man"s request, and seeing that the two Jews had fallen victims to the charms of the Circassian ladies, gave his consent to their union, which was fixed to take place at the same time as that of Izaf with the wise Sumi.

Then the jackal kicked him out of the way, and went to the well and began to drink, but scarcely had he touched the water, than the tortoise seized him by the leg. The jackal shrieked out: "Oh, you will break my leg!" but the tortoise only held on the tighter. The jackal then took his bag and tried to make the tortoise smell the honeycomb he had inside; but the tortoise turned away his head and smelt nothing.

Now, the nurse was a witch, though the king did not know it. For some time she listened and tried to soothe the princess; but when she saw that she would not be comforted, she said to her: "Your father loves you very dearly, as you know. Whatever you were to ask from him he would give you. The one thing he will not grant you is permission to leave the palace. Now, do as I tell you. Go to your father and ask him to give you a wooden wheel-barrow, and a bear"s skin. When you have got them bring them to me, and I will touch them with my magic wand.

The poor girl longed to speak, but dread of the ogre kept her silent, and the prince did as he had said, and brought a fresh bride into the palace.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1793'>"Ah, now I see who is my true son," exclaimed the old man; "the others are mere cowards. And as you have shown me that you are brave, I will satisfy your curiosity. My right eye laughs because I am glad to have a son like you; my left eye weeps because a precious treasure has been stolen from me. I had in my garden a vine that yielded a tun of wine every hour--someone has managed to steal it, so I weep its loss."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1794'>The simpleton returned to his brothers and told them of their father"s loss, and they all made up their minds to set out at once in search of the vine. They travelled together till they came to some cross roads, and there they parted, the two elder ones taking one road, and the simpleton the other.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1795'>"Thank goodness we have got rid of that idiot," exclaimed the two elder. "Now let us have some breakfast."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1796'>They had only half finished, when a lame fox came out of a wood and begged them to give him something to eat. But they jumped up and chased him off with their sticks, and the poor fox limped away on his three pads. As he ran he reached the spot where the youngest son was getting out the food he had brought with him, and the fox asked him for a crust of bread. The simpleton had not very much for himself, but he gladly gave half of his meal to the hungry fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1797'>"Where are you going, brother?" said the fox, when he had finished his share of the bread; and the young man told him the story of his father and the wonderful vine.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1799'>"You will find here the vine that you are seeking, but it will not be at all easy to get it. You must listen carefully to what I am going to say. Before you reach the vine you will have to pass twelve outposts, each consisting of two guards. If you see these guards looking straight at you, go on without fear, for they are asleep. But if their eyes are shut then beware, for they are wide awake. If you once get to the vine, you will find two shovels, one of wood and the other of iron. Be sure not to take the iron one; it will make a noise and rouse the guards, and then you are lost."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1800'>The young man got safely through the garden without any adventures till he came to the vine which yielded a tun of wine an hour. But he thought he should find it impossible to dig the hard earth with only a wooden shovel, so picked up the iron one instead. The noise it made soon awakened the guards. They seized the poor simpleton and carried him to their master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1801'>"Why do you try to steal my vine?" demanded he; "and how did you manage to get past the guards?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1802'>"The vine is not yours; it belongs to my father, and if you will not give it to me now, I will return and get it somehow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1803'>"You shall have the vine if you will bring me in exchange an apple off the golden apple-tree that flowers every twenty-four hours, and bears fruit of gold." So saying, he gave orders that the simpleton should be released, and this done, the youth hurried off to consult the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1804'>"Now you see," observed the fox, "this comes of not following my advice. However, I will help you to get the golden apple. It grows in a garden that you will easily recognise from my description. Near the apple-tree are two poles, one of gold, the other of wood. Take the wooden pole, and you will be able to reach the apple."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1805'>Master Simpleton listened carefully to all that was told him, and after crossing the garden, and escaping as before from the men who were watching it, soon arrived at the apple-tree. But he was so dazzled by the sight of the beautiful golden fruit, that he quite forgot all that the fox had said. He seized the golden pole, and struck the branch a sounding blow. The guards at once awoke, and conducted him to their master. Then the simpleton had to tell his story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1806'>"I will give you the golden apple," said the owner of the garden, "if you will bring me in exchange a horse which can go round the world in four-and-twenty hours." And the young man departed, and went to find the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1807'>This time the fox was really angry, and no wonder.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1808'>"If you had listened to me, you would have been home with your father by this time. However I am willing to help you once more. Go into the forest, and you will find the horse with two halters round his neck. One is of gold, the other of hemp. Lead him by the hempen halter, or else the horse will begin to neigh, and will waken the guards. Then all is over with you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1809'>So Master Simpleton searched till he found the horse, and was struck dumb at its beauty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1810'>"What!" he said to himself, "put the hempen halter on an animal like that? Not I, indeed!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1815'>"I swear on the head of my father," answered the young man, "that I will bring back either the maiden or the horse." And he went away to consult the fox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1816'>Now, the fox who was always patient and charitable to other people"s faults, led him to the entrance of a deep grotto, where stood a maiden all of gold, and beautiful as the day. He placed her on his horse and prepared to mount.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1824'>By that time he hoped he would have so many things to think about that he would have forgotten to trouble about the little son who never came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1825'>The country the king reigned over was very large, and full of high, stony mountains and sandy deserts, so that it was not at all easy to go from one place to another. One day the king had wandered out alone, meaning to go only a little distance, but everything looked so alike he could not make out the path by which he had come. He walked on and on for hours, the sun beating hotly on his head, and his legs trembling under him, and he might have died of thirst if he had not suddenly stumbled on a little well, which looked as if it had been newly dug. On the surface floated a silver cup with a golden handle, but as it bobbed about whenever <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fill;silver;surface;cup' adjectives='golden;longer;thirsty' verbs='be;drink;handle;seize;float;try;bob;kneel;wait' valence='5.63823529412' arousal='3.87235294118' dominance='5.66235294118'>the king</entity> tried to seize it, he was too thirsty to wait any longer and knelt down and drank his fill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1826'>When he had finished he began to rise from his knees, but somehow his beard seemed to have stuck fast in the water, and with all his efforts he could not pull it out. After two or three jerks to his head, which only hurt him without doing any good, he called out angrily, "Let go at once! Who is holding me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1827'>"It is I, the King Kostiei," said a voice from the well, and looking up through the water was a little man with green eyes and a big head. "You have drunk from my spring, and I shall not let you go until you promise to give me the most precious thing your palace contains, which was not there when you left it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1828'>Now the only thing that the king much cared for in his palace was the queen herself, and as she was weeping bitterly on a pile of cushions in the great hall when he had ridden away, he knew that Kostiei"s words could not apply to her. So he cheerfully gave the promise asked for by the ugly little man, and in the twinkling of an eye, man, spring, and cup had disappeared, and the king was left kneeling on the dry sand, wondering if it was all a dream. But as he felt much stronger and better he made up his mind that this strange adventure must really have happened, and he sprang on his horse and rode off with a light heart to look for his companions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1829'>In a few weeks they began to set out on their return home, which they reached one hot day, eight months after they had all left. The king was greatly beloved by his people, and crowds lined the roads, shouting and waving their hats as the procession passed along. On the steps of the palace stood the queen, with a splendid golden cushion in her arms, and on the cushion the most beautiful boy that ever was seen, wrapped about in a cloud of lace. In a moment Kostiei"s words rushed into the king"s mind, and he began to weep bitterly, to the surprise of everybody, who had expected him nearly to die of joy at the sight of his son. But try as he would and work as hard as he might he could never forget his promise, and every time he let the baby out of his sight he thought that he had seen it for the last time.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1830'>However, years passed on and the prince grew first into a big boy, and then into a fine young man. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;end;sign' adjectives='anxious;less' verbs='make;think;forget' valence='5.19714285714' arousal='4.29285714286' dominance='5.04857142857'>Kostiei</entity> made no sign, and gradually even the anxious king thought less and less about him, and in the end forgot him altogether.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1837'>Then the prince began to prepare for his journey. His father gave him a complete suit of steel armour, a sword, and a horse, while his mother hung round his neck a cross of gold. So, kissing him tenderly, with many tears they let him go.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1838'>He rode steadily on for three days, and at sunset on the fourth day he found himself on the seashore. On the sand before him lay twelve white dresses, dazzling as the snow, yet as far as his eyes could reach there was no one in sight to whom they could belong. Curious to see what would happen, he took up one of the garments, and leaving his horse loose, to wander about the adjoining fields, he hid himself among some willows and waited. In a few minutes a flock of geese which had been paddling about in the sea approached the shore, and put on the dresses, struck the sand with their feet and were transformed in the twinkling of an eye into eleven beautiful young girls, who flew away as fast as they could. The twelfth and youngest remained in the water, stretching out her long white neck and looking about her anxiously. Suddenly, among the willows, she perceived <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='willow;s;voice;son' adjectives='human' verbs='call;perceive' valence='5.97777777778' arousal='4.02777777778' dominance='5.42444444444'>the king</entity>"s son, and called out to him with a human voice:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1840'>The prince hastened to lay the dress on the sand, and walked away. When the maiden had thrown off the goose-skin and quickly put on her proper clothes, she came towards him and he saw that none had ever seen or told of such beauty as hers. She blushed and held out her hand, saying to him in a soft voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1841'>"I thank you, noble Prince, for having granted my request. I am the youngest daughter of Kostiei the immortal, who has twelve daughters and rules over the kingdoms under the earth. Long time my father has waited for you, and great is his anger.

That which will happen after, you will know in time. Now let us go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1842'>At these words she struck the ground with her foot and a gulf opened, down which they went right into the heart of the earth.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1843'>Kostiei, with a shining crown upon his head, sat in the centre upon a golden throne. His green eyes glittered like glass, his hands were as the claws of a crab. When he caught sight of the prince he uttered piercing yells, which shook the walls of the palace.

When he had almost reached it, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='laugh' adjectives='' verbs='break;say;reach;have' valence='5.88714285714' arousal='4.58285714286' dominance='5.82'>the king</entity> broke out into a laugh and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1847'>The prince listened in silence to this startling speech, and then returning to his room set himself to think about the certain death that awaited him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1944'>A man once possessed a donkey which had served him faithfully for many years, but at last the poor beast grew old and feeble, and every day his work became more of a burden. As he was no longer of any use, his master made up his mind to shoot him; but when the donkey learnt the fate that was in store for him, he determined not to die, but to run away to the nearest town and there to become a street musician.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1945'>When he had trotted along for some distance he came upon a greyhound lying on the road, and panting for dear life. "Well, brother," said the donkey, "what"s the matter with you? You look rather tired."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1946'>"So I am," replied the dog, "but because I am getting old and am growing weaker every day, and cannot go out hunting any longer, my master wanted to poison me; and, as life is still sweet, I have taken leave of him. But how I am to earn my own livelihood I haven"t a notion."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1947'>"Well," said the donkey, "I am on my way to the nearest big town, where I mean to become a street musician. Why don"t you take up music as a profession and come along with me? I"ll play the flute and you can play the kettle-drum."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1948'>The greyhound was quite pleased at the idea, and the two set off together. When they had gone a short distance they met a cat with a face as long as three rainy days. "Now, what has happened to upset your happiness, friend puss?" inquired the donkey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1949'>"It"s impossible to look cheerful when one feels depressed," answered the cat. "I am well up in years now, and have lost most of my teeth; consequently I prefer sitting in front of the fire to catching mice, and so my old mistress wanted to drown me. I have no wish to die yet, so I ran away from her; but good advice is expensive, and I don"t know where I am to go to, or what I am to do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1950'>"Come to the nearest big town with us," said the donkey, "and try your fortune as a street musician. I know what sweet music you make at night, so you are sure to be a success."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1951'>The cat was delighted with the donkey"s proposal, and they all continued their journey together. In a short time they came to the courtyard of an inn, where they found a cock crowing lustily. "What in the world is the matter with you?" asked the donkey. "The noise you are making is enough to break the drums of our ears."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1952'>"I am only prophesying good weather," said the cock; "for to-morrow is a feast day, and just because it is a holiday and a number of people are expected at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='neck;people;to-morrow;number;soup;s;weather;dinner;holiday;cock;order;landlady' adjectives='good;feast;to-night' verbs='be;give;prophesy;say;expect;have;wring;make' valence='5.91' arousal='4.13606060606' dominance='5.58454545455'>the inn</entity>, the landlady has given orders for my neck to be wrung to-night, so that I may be made into soup for to-morrow"s dinner."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1953'>"I"ll tell you what, redcap," said the donkey; "you had much better come with us to the nearest town. You have got a good voice, and could join a street band we are getting up." The cock was much pleased with the idea, and the party proceeded on their way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1954'>But the nearest big town was a long way off, and it took them more than a day to reach it. In the evening they came to a wood, and they made up their minds to go no further, but to spend the night there. The donkey and the greyhound lay down under a big tree, and the cat and the cock got up into the branches, the cock flying right up to the topmost twig, where he thought he would be safe from all danger. Before he went to sleep he looked round the four points of the compass, and saw a little spark burning in the distance. He called out to his companions that he was sure there must be a house not far off, for he could see a light shining.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1955'>When he heard this, the donkey said at, once: "Then we must get up, and go and look for the house, for this is very poor shelter." And the greyhound added: "Yes; I feel I"d be all the better for a few bones and a scrap or two of meat."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1956'>So they set out for the spot where the light was to be seen shining faintly in the distance, but the nearer they approached it the brighter it grew, till at last they came to a brilliantly lighted house. The donkey being the biggest of the party, went to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='party;donkey' adjectives='biggest' verbs='go;be;look' valence='6.39833333333' arousal='4.05' dominance='5.52333333333'>the window</entity> and looked in.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1958'>"I see a well-covered table," replied the donkey, "with excellent food and drink, and several robbers are sitting round it, enjoying themselves highly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1959'>"I wish we were doing the same," said the cock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1960'>"So do I," answered the donkey.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1961'>So they consulted together what they were to do, and at last they arranged that the donkey should stand at the window with his fore-feet on the sill, that the greyhound should get on his back, the cat on the dog"s shoulder, and the cock on the cat"s head. When they had grouped themselves in this way, at a given signal, they all began their different forms of music. The donkey brayed, the greyhound barked, the cat miawed, and the cock crew. Then they all scrambled through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='glass;piece' adjectives='' verbs='break;do;scramble' valence='5.54222222222' arousal='3.75' dominance='5.31444444444'>the window</entity> into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='glass;piece' adjectives='' verbs='break;do;scramble' valence='5.54222222222' arousal='3.75' dominance='5.31444444444'>the room</entity>, breaking the glass into a thousand pieces as they did so.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1962'>The robbers were all startled by the dreadful noise, and thinking that some evil spirits at the least were entering the house, they rushed out into the wood, their hair standing on end with terror.

	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='1963'>When they had finished their meal they put out the lights, and each animal chose a suitable sleeping-place.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1964'>Shortly after midnight, when the robbers saw that no light was burning in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fool;light;band;captain;robber;man' adjectives='safe;frightened;quiet' verbs='be;burn;say;turn;see;let;go;seem;order' valence='5.6176' arousal='3.912' dominance='5.394'>the house</entity> and that all seemed quiet, the captain of the band said: "We were fools to let ourselves be so easily frightened away;" and, turning to one of his men, he ordered him to go and see if all was safe.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1965'>The man found everything in silence and darkness, and going into the kitchen he thought he had better strike a light. He took a match, and mistaking the fiery eyes of the cat for two glowing coals, he tried to light his match with them. But the cat didn"t see the joke, and sprang at his face, spitting and scratching him in the most vigorous manner. The man was terrified out of his life, and tried to run out by the back door; but he stumbled over the greyhound, which bit him in the leg. Yelling with pain he ran across the courtyard only to receive a kick from the donkey"s hind leg as he passed him. In the meantime the cock had been roused from his slumbers, and feeling very cheerful he called out, from the shelf where he was perched, "Kikeriki!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1966'>Then the robber hastened back to his captain and said: "Sir, there is a dreadful witch in the house, who spat at me and scratched my face with her long fingers; and before the door there stands a man with a long knife, who cut my leg severely. In the courtyard outside lies a black monster, who fell upon me with a huge wooden club; and that is not all, for, sitting on the roof, is a judge, who called out: "Bring the rascal to me." So I fled for dear life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1967'>After this the robbers dared not venture into the house again, and they abandoned it for ever. But the four street musicians were so delighted with their lodgings that they determined to take up their abode in the robbers" house, and, for all I know to the contrary, they may be living there to this day.</paragraph>

It was not long before she had ample proof of the success of her enchantments. Almost before her eyes the children put on the size and strength of adults, while the old men and women instantly became helpless, tiny babies.

They stored up the dew that fell, and the juice of fruits and of herbs, but all this was as a drop in the ocean of their wants. Some threw themselves into the sea, trusting that the current might carry them to other shores--they had no boats--and a few, still more impatient, put themselves to death on the spot. The rest submitted blindly to their destiny.</paragraph>

Selnozoura never made these trips alone, but always took with her two children, of whom she was very fond--Cornichon, a boy of fourteen, bought in his childhood at a slave-market, and Toupette, a few months younger, who had been entrusted to the care of the fairy by her guardian, the genius Kristopo. Cornichon and Toupette were intended by Selnozoura to become husband and wife, as soon as they were old enough. Meanwhile, they travelled with her in a little vessel, whose speed through the air was just a thousand nine hundred and fifty times greater than that of the swiftest of our ships.</paragraph>

While she was thus engaged, Cornichon and Toupette wandered away by themselves, and by-and-by arrived at the fountain, whose bubbling waters looked cool and delicious on such a hot day.

Hastily demanding an audience of the fairy, he laid his proposals before her, never doubting that she would give her consent to so brilliant a match.

What was their amazement, therefore, at finding, instead of a lovely girl, a middle-aged woman, handsome indeed, but quite faded--looking, in fact, older than themselves. Kristopo, hardly less astonished than they were at the sudden change, thought that it was a joke on the part of one of his courtiers, who had hidden Toupette away, and put this elderly lady in her place.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2202'>On hearing these words the old king drew from his pocket a key of gold, and gave it to his son, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2203'>"Go up the staircase, right up to the top of the tower. Look carefully round you, and then come and tell me which you like best of all that you see."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2204'>So the young man went up.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2205'>The staircase wound round and round and round, till the prince was almost giddy, and every now and then he caught sight of a large room that opened out from the side. But he had been told to go to the top, and to the top he went. Then he found himself in a hall, which had an iron door at one end. This door he unlocked with his golden key, and he passed through into a vast chamber which had a roof of blue sprinkled with golden stars, and a carpet of green silk soft as turf. Twelve windows framed in gold let in the light of the sun, and on every window was painted the figure of a young girl, each more beautiful than the last. While the prince gazed at them in surprise, not knowing which he liked best, the girls began to lift their eyes and smile at him. He waited, expecting them to speak, but no sound came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2206'>Suddenly he noticed that one of the windows was covered by a curtain of white silk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2207'>He lifted it, and saw before him the image of a maiden beautiful as the day and sad as the tomb, clothed in a white robe, having a girdle of silver and a crown of pearls. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;stone;sadness;face' adjectives='' verbs='be;look;cry;turn;gaze;stand;have;pass;seem' valence='5.42666666667' arousal='3.92066666667' dominance='5.298'>The prince</entity> stood and gazed at her, as if he had been turned into stone, but as he looked the sadness which, was on her face seemed to pass into his heart, and he cried out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2208'>"This one shall be my wife. This one and no other."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2209'>As he said the words the young girl blushed and hung her head, and all the other figures vanished.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2210'>The young prince went quickly back to his father, and told him all he had seen and which wife he had chosen. The old man listened to him full of sorrow, and then he spoke:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2211'>"You have done ill, my son, to search out that which was hidden, and you are running to meet a great danger. This young girl has fallen into the power of a wicked sorcerer, who lives in an iron castle. Many young men have tried to deliver her, and none have ever come back. But what is done is done! You have given your word, and it cannot be broken. Go, dare your fate, and return to me safe and sound."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2212'>So the prince embraced his father, mounted his horse, and set forth to seek his bride. He rode on gaily for several hours, till he found himself in a wood where he had never been before, and soon lost his way among its winding paths and deep valleys. He tried in vain to see where he was: the thick trees shut out the sun, and he could not tell which was north and which was south, so that he might know what direction to make for. He felt in despair, and had quite given up all hope of getting out of this horrible place, when he heard a voice calling to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2213'>"Hey! hey! stop a minute!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2217'>"Long is my name, and I can lengthen my body at will. Do you see that nest up there on the top of that pine-tree?

He put <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pocket;eyelid' adjectives='small' verbs='put;wink;make;stand;have' valence='5.71666666667' arousal='3.92555555556' dominance='5.62333333333'>the nest</entity> in his pocket, and before you could wink your eyelid he had made himself small again, and stood before <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pocket;eyelid' adjectives='small' verbs='put;wink;make;stand;have' valence='5.71666666667' arousal='3.92555555556' dominance='5.62333333333'>the prince</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2218'>"Yes; you know your business," said he, "but birds" nests are no use to me. I am too old for them. Now if you were only able to get me out of this wood, you would indeed be good for something."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2219'>"Oh, there"s no difficulty about that," replied Long, and he stretched himself up and up and up till he was three times as tall as the tallest tree in the forest. Then he looked all round and said, "We must go in this direction in order to get out of the wood," and shortening himself again, he took the prince"s horse by the bridle, and led him along. Very soon they got clear of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fortification;tree;town;pile;rock' adjectives='high;wide;clear;plain' verbs='cover;see;end;get' valence='5.55294117647' arousal='3.89588235294' dominance='5.48764705882'>the forest</entity>, and saw before them a wide plain ending in a pile of high rocks, covered here and there with trees, and very much like the fortifications of a town.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2220'>As they left the wood behind, Long turned to the prince and said, "My lord, here comes my comrade. You should take him into your service too, as you will find him a great help."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2221'>"Well, call him then, so that I can see what sort of a man he is."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2222'>"He is a little too far off for that," replied Long. "He would hardly hear my voice, and he couldn"t be here for some time yet, as he has so much to carry. I think I had better go and bring him myself," and this time he stretched himself to such a height that his head was lost in the clouds. He made two or three strides, took his friend on his back, and set him down before the prince. The new-comer was a very fat man, and as round as a barrel.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2223'>"Who are you?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask;do' valence='5.8025' arousal='3.86' dominance='5.8675'>the prince</entity>, "and what can you do?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2227'>The prince did not understand why he should run to the wood, but when he saw Long flying towards it, he thought he had better follow his example. He was only just in time, for Broad had so suddenly inflated himself that he very nearly knocked over the prince and his horse too. He covered all the space for acres round. You would have thought he was a mountain!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2228'>At length Broad ceased to expand, drew a deep breath that made the whole forest tremble, and shrank into his usual size.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2229'>"You have made me run away," said the prince. "But it is not every day one meets with a man of your sort. I will take you into my service."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2230'>So the three companions continued their journey, and when they were drawing near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='journey;eye;bandage;man;companion' adjectives='' verbs='be;draw;continue;cover;meet' valence='5.76666666667' arousal='3.832' dominance='5.63733333333'>the rocks</entity> they met a man whose eyes were covered by a bandage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2231'>"Your excellency," said Long, "this is our third comrade. You will do well to take him into your service, and, I assure you, you will find him worth his salt."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2232'>"Who are you?" asked the prince. "And why are your eyes bandaged? You can never see your way!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2233'>"It is just the contrary, my lord! It is because I see only too well that I am forced to bandage my eyes. Even so I see as well as people who have no bandage. When I take it off my eyes pierce through everything. Everything I look at catches fire, or, if it cannot catch fire, it falls into a thousand pieces. They call me Quickeye."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2234'>And so saying he took off his bandage and turned towards the rock. As he fixed his eyes upon it a crack was heard, and in a few moments it was nothing but a heap of sand. In the sand something might be detected glittering brightly. Quickeye picked it up and brought it to the prince. It turned out to be a lump of pure gold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2235'>"You are a wonderful creature," said the prince, "and I should be a fool not to take you into my service. But since your eyes are so good, tell me if I am very far from the Iron Castle, and what is happening there just now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2236'>"If you were travelling alone," replied Quickeye, "it would take you at least a year to get to it; but as we are with you, we shall arrive there to-night. Just now they are preparing supper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2237'>"There is a princess in the castle. Do you see her?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2238'>"A wizard keeps her in a high tower, guarded by iron bars."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2240'>And they promised they would.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2241'>Then they all set out through the grey rocks, by the breach made by the eyes of Quickeye, and passed over great mountains and through deep woods. And every time they met with any obstacle the three friends contrived somehow to put it aside. As the sun was setting, the prince beheld the towers of the Iron Castle, and before it sank beneath the horizon he was crossing the iron bridge which led to the gates. He was only just in time, for no sooner had the sun disappeared altogether, than <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sun;gate;time' adjectives='' verbs='shut;be;draw;disappear;have' valence='5.56666666667' arousal='3.88666666667' dominance='5.41'>the bridge</entity> drew itself up and the gates shut themselves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2242'>There was no turning back now!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2243'>The prince put up his horse in the stable, where everything looked as if a guest was expected, and then the whole party marched straight up to the castle. In the court, in the stables, and all over the great halls, they saw a number of men richly dressed, but every one turned into stone. They crossed an endless set of rooms, all opening into each other, till they reached the dining-hall. It was brilliantly lighted; the table was covered with wine and fruit, and was laid for four. They waited a few minutes expecting someone to come, but as nobody did, they sat down and began to eat and drink, for they were very hungry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2244'>When they had done their supper they looked about for some place to sleep. But suddenly the door burst open, and the wizard entered the hall. He was old and hump-backed, with a bald head and a grey beard that fell to his knees. He wore a black robe, and instead of a belt three iron circlets clasped his waist. He led by the hand a lady of wonderful beauty, dressed in white, with a girdle of silver and a crown of pearls, but her face was pale and sad as death itself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2245'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wizard;instant;time' adjectives='' verbs='speak;say;move;know;give' valence='5.972' arousal='4.265' dominance='5.404'>The prince</entity> knew her in an instant, and moved eagerly forward; but the wizard gave him no time to speak, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2246'>"I know why you are here. Very good; you may have her if for three nights following you can prevent her making her escape. If you fail in this, you and your servants will all be turned into stone, like those who have come before you." And offering <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chair' adjectives='' verbs='leave;offer' valence='5.795' arousal='3.97166666667' dominance='5.19166666667'>the princess</entity> a chair, he left <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='chair' adjectives='' verbs='leave;offer' valence='5.795' arousal='3.97166666667' dominance='5.19166666667'>the hall</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2247'>The prince could not take his eyes from the princess, she was so lovely! He began to talk to her, but she neither answered nor smiled, and sat as if she were made of marble. He seated himself by her, and determined not to close his eyes that night, for fear she should escape him. And in order that she should be doubly guarded, Long stretched himself like a strap all round the room, Broad took his stand by the door and puffed himself out, so that not even a mouse could slip by, and Quickeye leant against a pillar which stood in the middle of the floor and supported the roof. But in half a second they were all sound asleep, and they slept sound the whole night long.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2248'>In the morning, at the first peep of dawn, the prince awoke with a start. But the princess was gone. He aroused his servants and implored them to tell him what he must do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2249'>"Calm yourself, my lord," said Quickeye. "I have found her already. A hundred miles from here there is a forest. In the middle of the forest, an old oak, and on the top of the oak, an acorn. This acorn is the princess. If Long will take me on his shoulders, we shall soon bring her back." And sure enough, in less time than it takes to walk round a cottage, they had returned from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cottage;acorn;round;long;time' adjectives='sure;less' verbs='present;return;take;have;walk' valence='5.99846153846' arousal='3.90307692308' dominance='5.43461538462'>the forest</entity>, and Long presented the acorn to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cottage;acorn;round;long;time' adjectives='sure;less' verbs='present;return;take;have;walk' valence='5.99846153846' arousal='3.90307692308' dominance='5.43461538462'>the prince</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2250'>"Now, your excellency, throw it on the ground."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2251'>The prince obeyed, and was enchanted to see the princess appear at his side. But when the sun peeped for the first time over the mountains, the door burst open as before, and the wizard entered with a loud laugh. Suddenly he caught sight of the princess; his face darkened, he uttered a low growl, and one of the iron circlets gave way with a crash. He seized the young girl by the hand and bore her away with him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2252'>All that day the prince wandered about the castle, studying the curious treasures it contained, but everything looked as if life had suddenly come to a standstill. In one place he saw a prince who had been turned into stone in the act of brandishing a sword round which his two hands were clasped. In another, the same doom had fallen upon a knight in the act of running away. In a third, a serving man was standing eternally trying to convey a piece of beef to his mouth, and all around them were others, still preserving for evermore the attitudes they were in when the wizard had commanded "From henceforth be turned into marble." In the castle, and round the castle all was dismal and desolate. Trees there were, but without leaves; fields there were, but no grass grew on them. There was one river, but it never flowed and no fish lived in it. No flowers blossomed, and no birds sang.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2253'>Three times during the day food appeared, as if by magic, for the prince and his servants.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2254'>All four determined that this time they would keep awake at any cost. But it was no use.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2255'>With a pang of shame, he rushed to find Quickeye. "Awake! Awake! Quickeye!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2256'>Quickeye rubbed his eyes and answered: "Yes, I see her. Two hundred miles from here there is a mountain. In this mountain is a rock. In the rock, a precious stone. This stone is the princess. Long shall take me there, and we will be back before you can turn round."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2257'>So Long took him on his shoulders and they set out. At every stride they covered twenty miles, and as they drew near Quickeye fixed his burning eyes on the mountain; in an instant it split into a thousand pieces, and in one of these sparkled the precious stone. They picked it up and brought it to the prince, who flung it hastily down, and as the stone touched the floor the princess stood before him. When the wizard came, his eyes shot forth flames of fury. Cric-crac was heard, and another of his iron bands broke and fell. He seized <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hand' adjectives='' verbs='growl;lead;seize' valence='5.464' arousal='4.272' dominance='5.426'>the princess</entity> by the hand and led her off, growling louder than ever.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2259'>That night they struggled their very hardest to keep awake, and even walked about instead of sitting down. But it was quite useless.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2262'>Quickeye looked about for some time without answering. "Oh, my lord, she is far, very far. Three hundred miles away there lies a black sea.

Only to-day, Long must take Broad with him. He will be wanted badly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2263'>So Long took Quickeye on one shoulder, and Broad on the other, and they set out. At each stride they left thirty miles behind them. When they reached the black sea, Quickeye showed them the spot where they must seek the shell.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2265'>Then he swelled himself out so that you would have thought the world could hardly have held him, and stooping down he drank. He drank so much at every mouthful, that only a minute or so passed before the water had sunk enough for Long to put his hand to the bottom. He soon found the shell, and pulled the ring out. But time had been lost, and Long had a double burden to carry.

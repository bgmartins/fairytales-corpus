	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='10'>The Editor takes this opportunity to repeat what he has often said before, that he is not the author of the stories in the Fairy Books; that he did not invent them "out of his own head." He is accustomed to being asked, by ladies, "Have you written anything else except the Fairy Books?" He is then obliged to explain that he has NOT written the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hymn;everything;work;sermon' adjectives='dramatic' verbs='be;oblige;explain;write;have;save' valence='5.89153846154' arousal='4.01846153846' dominance='5.65076923077'>Fairy</entity> Books, but, save these, has written almost everything else, except hymns, sermons, and dramatic works.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='11'>The stories in this Violet Fairy Book, as in all the others of the series, have been translated out of the popular traditional tales in a number of different languages. These stories are as old as anything that men have invented. They are narrated by naked savage women to naked savage children. They have been inherited by our earliest civilised ancestors, who really believed that beasts and trees and stones can talk if they choose, and behave kindly or unkindly. The stories are full of the oldest ideas of ages when science did not exist, and magic took the place of science. Anybody who has the curiosity to read the "Legendary Australian Tales," which Mrs. Langloh Parker has collected from the lips of the Australian savages, will find that these tales are closely akin to our own. Who were the first authors of them nobody knows--probably the first men and women. Eve may have told these tales to amuse Cain and Abel. As people grew more civilised and had kings and queens, princes and princesses, these exalted persons generally were chosen as heroes and heroines. But originally the characters were just "a man," and "a woman," and "a boy," and "a girl," with crowds of beasts, birds, and fishes, all behaving like human beings. When the nobles and other people became rich and educated, they forgot the old stories, but the country people did not, and handed them down, with changes at pleasure, from generation to generation. Then learned men collected and printed the country people"s stories, and these we have translated, to amuse children. Their tastes remain like the tastes of their naked ancestors, thousands of years ago, and they seem to like fairy tales better than history, poetry, geography, or arithmetic, just as grown-up people like novels better than anything else.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='12'>This is the whole truth of the matter. I have said so before, and I say so again. But nothing will prevent children from thinking that I invented the stories, or some ladies from being of the same opinion. But who really invented the stories nobody knows; it is all so long ago, long before reading and writing were invented. The first of the stories actually written down, were written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, or on Babylonian cakes of clay, three or four thousand years before our time.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='13'>Of the stories in this book, Miss Blackley translated "Dwarf Long Nose," "The Wonderful Beggars," "The Lute Player," "Two in a Sack," and "The Fish that swam in the Air." Mr. W. A. Craigie translated from the Scandinavian, "Jasper who herded the Hares." Mrs. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rest;mrs.' adjectives='' verbs='do' valence='6.635' arousal='2.98' dominance='6.065'>Lang</entity> did the rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='14'>Some of the most interesting are from the Roumanion, and three were previously published in the late Dr. Steere"s "Swahili Tales." By the permission of his representatives these three African stories have here been abridged and simplified for children.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='54'>A TALE OF THE TONTLAWALD</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>Long, long ago there stood in the midst of a country covered with lakes a vast stretch of moorland called the Tontlawald, on which no man ever dared set foot. From time to time a few bold spirits had been drawn by curiosity to its borders, and on their return had reported that they had caught a glimpse of a ruined house in a grove of thick trees, and round about it were a crowd of beings resembling men, swarming over the grass like bees. The men were as dirty and ragged as gipsies, and there were besides a quantity of old women and half-naked children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>One night a peasant who was returning home from a feast wandered a little farther into the Tontlawald, and came back with the same story. A countless number of women and children were gathered round a huge fire, and some were seated on the ground, while others danced strange dances on the smooth grass. One old crone had a broad iron ladle in her hand, with which every now and then she stirred the fire, but the moment she touched the glowing ashes the children rushed away, shrieking like night owls, and it was a long while before they ventured to steal back. And besides all this there had once or twice been seen a little old man with a long beard creeping out of the forest, carrying a sack bigger than himself. The women and children ran by his side, weeping and trying to drag the sack from off his back, but he shook them off, and went on his way. There was also a tale of a magnificent black cat as large as a foal, but men could not believe all the wonders told by the peasant, and it was difficult to make out what was true and what was false in his story. However, the fact remained that strange things did happen there, and the King of Sweden, to whom this part of the country belonged, more than once gave orders to cut down the haunted wood, but there was no one with courage enough to obey his commands. At length one man, bolder than the rest, struck his axe into a tree, but his blow was followed by a stream of blood and shrieks as of a human creature in pain. The terrified woodcutter fled as fast as his legs would carry him, and after that neither orders nor threats would drive anybody to the enchanted moor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>A few miles from the Tontlawald was a large village, where dwelt a peasant who had recently married a young wife. As not uncommonly happens in such cases, she turned the whole house upside down, and the two quarrelled and fought all day long.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>By his first wife the peasant had a daughter called Elsa, a good quiet girl, who only wanted to live in peace, but this her stepmother would not allow. She beat and cuffed the poor child from morning till night, but as the stepmother had the whip-hand of her husband there was no remedy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>For two years Elsa suffered all this ill-treatment, when one day she went out with the other village children to pluck strawberries. Carelessly they wandered on, till at last they reached the edge of the Tontlawald, where the finest strawberries grew, making the grass red with their colour. The children flung themselves down on the ground, and, after eating as many as they wanted, began to pile up their baskets, when suddenly a cry arose from one of the older boys:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>"Run, run as fast as you can! We are in the Tontlawald!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='61'>Quicker than lightning they sprang to their feet, and rushed madly away, all except Elsa, who had strayed farther than the rest, and had found a bed of the finest strawberries right under the trees. Like the others, she heard <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='strawberry;s;other;mind' adjectives='' verbs='leave;make;cry;hear' valence='5.831' arousal='4.331' dominance='5.537'>the boy</entity>"s cry, but could not make up her mind to leave the strawberries.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>"After all, what does it matter?" thought she. "The dwellers in the Tontlawald cannot be worse than my stepmother"; and looking up she saw a little black dog with a silver bell on its neck come barking towards her, followed by a maiden clad all in silk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='63'>"Be quiet," said she; then turning to Elsa she added: "I am so glad you did not run away with the other children. Stay here with me and be my friend, and we will play delightful games together, and every day we will go and gather strawberries. Nobody will dare to beat you if I tell them not. Come, let us go to my mother"; and taking <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pleasure;s;hand;dog;mother' adjectives='little;black;deeper' verbs='lead;jump;let;take;go;bark;come' valence='5.99666666667' arousal='4.358' dominance='5.65666666667'>Elsa</entity>"s hand she led her deeper into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pleasure;s;hand;dog;mother' adjectives='little;black;deeper' verbs='lead;jump;let;take;go;bark;come' valence='5.99666666667' arousal='4.358' dominance='5.65666666667'>the wood</entity>, the little black dog jumping up beside them and barking with pleasure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='64'>Oh! what wonders and splendours unfolded themselves before Elsa"s astonished eyes! She thought she really must be in Heaven. Fruit trees and bushes loaded with fruit stood before them, while birds gayer than the brightest butterfly sat in their branches and filled the air with their song. And the birds were not shy, but let the girls take them in their hands, and stroke their gold and silver feathers. In the centre of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;woman;centre;dwelling-house;s;companion;glass;doorway;garment' adjectives='precious;rich' verbs='shine;be;turn;ask;sit' valence='6.0025' arousal='3.939375' dominance='5.9025'>the garden</entity> was the dwelling-house, shining with glass and precious stones, and in the doorway sat a woman in rich garments, who turned to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stone;woman;centre;dwelling-house;s;companion;glass;doorway;garment' adjectives='precious;rich' verbs='shine;be;turn;ask;sit' valence='6.0025' arousal='3.939375' dominance='5.9025'>Elsa</entity>"s companion and asked:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>"What sort of a guest are you bringing to me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>"I found her alone in the wood," replied her daughter, "and brought her back with me for a companion. You will let her stay?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='67'>The mother laughed, but said nothing, only she looked Elsa up and down sharply. Then she told the girl to come near, and stroked her cheeks and spoke kindly to her, asking if her parents were alive, and if she really would like to stay with them. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='face;lap;hand' adjectives='' verbs='sob;stoop;s;kiss;bury;kneel' valence='5.129' arousal='4.366' dominance='5.18'>Elsa</entity> stooped and kissed her hand, then, kneeling down, buried her face in <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='face;lap;hand' adjectives='' verbs='sob;stoop;s;kiss;bury;kneel' valence='5.129' arousal='4.366' dominance='5.18'>the woman</entity>"s lap, and sobbed out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>"My mother has lain for many years under the ground. My father is still alive, but I am nothing to him, and my stepmother beats me all the day long. I can do nothing right, so let me, I pray you, stay with you. I will look after the flocks or do any work you tell me; I will obey your lightest word; only do not, I entreat you, send me back to her. She will half kill me for not having come back with the other children."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='69'>And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='do;rise;go;see;answer;smile' valence='6.373' arousal='4.014' dominance='6.39'>the woman</entity> smiled and answered, "Well, we will see what we can do with you," and, rising, went into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='do;rise;go;see;answer;smile' valence='6.373' arousal='4.014' dominance='6.39'>the house</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='70'>Then the daughter said to Elsa, "Fear nothing, my mother will be your friend. I saw by the way she looked that she would grant your request when she had thought over it," and, telling Elsa to wait, she entered the house to seek her mother. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fear;hope' adjectives='' verbs='feel;be;come;toss' valence='5.82' arousal='4.4625' dominance='5.5025'>Elsa</entity> meanwhile was tossed about between hope and fear, and felt as if <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fear;hope' adjectives='' verbs='feel;be;come;toss' valence='5.82' arousal='4.4625' dominance='5.5025'>the girl</entity> would never come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='71'>At last <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='box;grass;hand' adjectives='last' verbs='see;cross' valence='5.42166666667' arousal='3.71166666667' dominance='4.98166666667'>Elsa</entity> saw her crossing the grass with a box in her hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='72'>"My mother says we may play together to-day, as she wants to make up her mind what to do about you. But I hope you will stay here always, as I can"t bear you to go away. Have you ever been on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;have' valence='6.2' arousal='3.25' dominance='5.48'>the sea</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>"The sea?" asked Elsa, staring; "what is that? I"ve never heard of such a thing!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>"Oh, I"ll soon show you," answered the girl, taking the lid from the box, and at the very bottom lay a scrap of a cloak, a mussel shell, and two fish scales. Two drops of water were glistening on the cloak, and these the girl shook on the ground. In an instant the garden and lawn and everything else had vanished utterly, as if the earth had opened and swallowed them up, and as far as the eye could reach you could see nothing but water, which seemed at last to touch heaven itself. Only under their feet was a tiny dry spot. Then the girl placed the mussel shell on the water and took the fish scales in her hand. The mussel shell grew bigger and bigger, and turned into a pretty little boat, which would have held a dozen children. The girls stepped in, Elsa very cautiously, for which she was much laughed at by her friend, who used the fish scales for a rudder. The waves rocked the girls softly, as if they were lying in a cradle, and they floated on till they met other boats filled with men, singing and making merry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='75'>"We must sing you a song in return," said the girl, but as Elsa did not know any songs, she had to sing by herself. Elsa could not understand any of the men"s songs, but one word, she noticed, came over and over again, and that was "Kisika." <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='name' adjectives='' verbs='ask;reply;be;mean' valence='5.58' arousal='3.905' dominance='5.52666666667'>Elsa</entity> asked what it meant, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='name' adjectives='' verbs='ask;reply;be;mean' valence='5.58' arousal='3.905' dominance='5.52666666667'>the girl</entity> replied that it was her name.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>It was all so pleasant that they might have stayed there for ever had not a voice cried out to them, "Children, it is time for you to come home!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>So Kisika took the little box out of her pocket, with the piece of cloth lying in it, and dipped the cloth in the water, and lo! they were standing close to a splendid house in the middle of the garden. Everything round them was dry and firm, and there was no water anywhere. The mussel shell and the fish scales were put back in the box, and the girls went in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='78'>They entered a large hall, where four and twenty richly dressed women were sitting round a table, looking as if they were about to attend a wedding. At the head of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;chair' adjectives='golden' verbs='sit' valence='6.24375' arousal='3.84375' dominance='5.71125'>the table</entity> sat <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;chair' adjectives='golden' verbs='sit' valence='6.24375' arousal='3.84375' dominance='5.71125'>the lady</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;chair' adjectives='golden' verbs='sit' valence='6.24375' arousal='3.84375' dominance='5.71125'>the house</entity> in a golden chair.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='79'>Elsa did not know which way to look, for everything that met her eyes was more beautiful than she could have dreamed possible. But she sat down with the rest, and ate some delicious fruit, and thought she must be in heaven. The guests talked softly, but their speech was strange to Elsa, and she understood nothing of what was said. Then the hostess turned round and whispered something to a maid behind her chair, and the maid left the hall, and when she came back she brought a little old man with her, who had a beard longer than himself. He bowed low to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='low' verbs='stand;bow' valence='5.492' arousal='3.28' dominance='5.384'>the lady</entity> and then stood quietly near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='low' verbs='stand;bow' valence='5.492' arousal='3.28' dominance='5.384'>the door</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>"Do you see this girl?" said the lady of the house, pointing to Elsa. "I wish to adopt her for my daughter. Make me a copy of her, which we can send to her native village instead of herself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>The old man looked Elsa all up and down, as if he was taking her measure, bowed again to the lady, and left the hall. After dinner the lady said kindly to Elsa, "Kisika has begged me to let you stay with her, and you have told her you would like to live here. Is that so?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='82'>At these words Elsa fell on her knees, and kissed the lady"s hands and feet in gratitude for her escape from her cruel stepmother; but her hostess raised her from the ground and patted her head, saying, "All will go well as long as you are a good, obedient child, and I will take care of you and see that you want for nothing till you are grown up and can look after yourself. My waiting-maid, who teaches <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sort;waiting-maid;handiwork' adjectives='fine' verbs='teach' valence='6.59' arousal='3.536' dominance='5.836'>Kisika</entity> all sorts of fine handiwork, shall teach you too."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>Not long after the old man came back with a mould full of clay on his shoulders, and a little covered basket in his left hand. He put down his mould and his basket on the ground, took up a handful of clay, and made a doll as large as life. When it was finished he bored a hole in the doll"s breast and put a bit of bread inside; then, drawing a snake out of the basket, forced it to enter the hollow body.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='84'>"Now," he said to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;drop;blood' adjectives='maiden' verbs='be;say;want' valence='5.37333333333' arousal='4.63111111111' dominance='5.34222222222'>the lady</entity>, "all we want is a drop of the maiden"s blood."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='85'>When she heard this <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horror;soul' adjectives='white;evil' verbs='sell;be;hear;grow;think' valence='5.583' arousal='4.012' dominance='5.466'>Elsa</entity> grew white with horror, for she thought she was selling her soul to the evil one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='86'>"Do not be afraid!" <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='freedom;blood;happiness;purpose' adjectives='bad' verbs='do;say;hasten;want;give' valence='6.04090909091' arousal='4.88272727273' dominance='5.89818181818'>the lady</entity> hastened to say; "we do not want your blood for any bad purpose, but rather to give you freedom and happiness."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>Then she took a tiny golden needle, pricked Elsa in the arm, and gave the needle to the old man, who stuck it into the heart of the doll. When this was done he placed the figure in the basket, promising that the next day they should all see what a beautiful piece of work he had finished.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='88'>When Elsa awoke the next morning in her silken bed, with its soft white pillows, she saw a beautiful dress lying over the back of a chair, ready for her to put on. A maid came in to comb out her long hair, and brought the finest linen for her use; but nothing gave Elsa so much joy as the little pair of embroidered shoes that she held in her hand, for the girl had hitherto been forced to run about barefoot by her cruel stepmother. In her excitement she never gave a thought to the rough clothes she had worn the day before, which had disappeared as if by magic during the night. Who could have taken them? Well, she was to know that by-and-by. But WE can guess that the doll had been dressed in them, which was to go back to the village in her stead. By the time the sun rose the doll had attained her full size, and no one could have told one girl from the other. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='start;look;meet' valence='5.8025' arousal='3.7175' dominance='5.6225'>Elsa</entity> started back when she met herself as she looked only yesterday.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>"You must not be frightened," said the lady, when she noticed her terror; "this clay figure can do you no harm. It is for your stepmother, that she may beat it instead of you. Let her flog it as hard as she will, it can never feel any pain. And if the wicked woman does not come one day to a better mind your double will be able at last to give her the punishment she deserves."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>From this moment Elsa"s life was that of the ordinary happy child, who has been rocked to sleep in her babyhood in a lovely golden cradle. She had no cares or troubles of any sort, and every day her tasks became easier, and the years that had gone before seemed more and more like a bad dream. But the happier she grew the deeper was her wonder at everything around her, and the more firmly she was persuaded that some great unknown power must be at the bottom of it all.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>Now let us look back a moment, and see what had been going on in Elsa"s native village all these years, and how her double had fared. It is a well-known fact that a bad woman seldom becomes better as she grows older, and Elsa"s stepmother was no exception to the rule; but as the figure that had taken the girl"s place could feel no pain, the blows that were showered on her night and day made no difference. If the father ever tried to come to his daughter"s help, his wife turned upon him, and things were rather worse than before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='107'>One day the stepmother had given the girl a frightful beating, and then threatened to kill her outright.

At night, when the husband came home, he found his wife lying dead upon the ground, her body all swollen and disfigured, but the girl was nowhere to be seen. His screams brought the neighbours from their cottages, but they were unable to explain how it had all come about. It was true, they said, that about mid-day they had heard a great noise, but as that was a matter of daily occurrence they did not think much of it. The rest of the day all was still, but no one had seen anything of the daughter. The body of the dead woman was then prepared for burial, and her tired husband went to bed, rejoicing in his heart that he had been delivered from the firebrand who had made his home unpleasant.

The girl tried to speak, but before she could sob out her thanks the old man had touched her softly on the head three times with his silver staff. In an instant Elsa knew that she was turning into a bird: wings sprang from beneath her arms; her feet were the feet of eagles, with long claws; her nose curved itself into a sharp beak, and feathers covered her body. Then she soared high in the air, and floated up towards the clouds, as if she had really been hatched an eagle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>For several days she flew steadily south, resting from time to time when her wings grew tired, for hunger she never felt.

Suddenly a sharp pain quivered through her body, and she fell to the ground, pierced by an arrow.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='131'>"In my youth, when I was an old man, we had a quantity of beehives. Every morning when I got up I counted them over, and it was quite easy to number the bees, but I never could reckon the hives properly. One day, as I was counting the bees, I discovered that my best bee was missing, and without losing a moment I saddled a cock and went out to look for him. I traced him as far as the shore, and knew that he had crossed the sea, and that I must follow. When I had reached the other side I found a man had harnessed my bee to a plough, and with his help was sowing millet seed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='132'>""That is my bee!" I shouted. "Where did you get him from?"" "Brother," replied the man, "if he is yours, take him." And he not only gave me back my bee, but a sack of millet seed into the bargain, because he had made use of my bee. Then I put the bag on my shoulders, took the saddle from the cock, and placed it on the back of the bee, which I mounted, leading the cock by a string, so that he should have a rest. As we were flying home over the sea one of the strings that held the bag of millet broke in two, and the sack dropped straight into the ocean. It was quite lost, of course, and there was no use thinking about it, and by the time we were safe back again night had come. I then got down from my bee, and let him loose, that he might get his supper, gave the cock some hay, and went to sleep myself. But when I awoke with the sun what a scene met my eyes! During the night wolves had come and had eaten my bee. And honey lay ankle-deep in the valley and knee-deep on the hills. Then I began to consider how I could best collect some, to take home with me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='133'>"Now it happened that I had with me a small hatchet, and this I took to the wood, hoping to meet some animal which I could kill, whose skin I might turn into a bag. As I entered the forest I saw two roe-deer hopping on one foot, so I slew them with a single blow, and made three bags from their skins, all of which I filled with honey and placed on the back of the cock. At length I reached home, where I was told that my father had just been born, and that I must go at once to fetch some holy water to sprinkle him with. As I went I turned over in my mind if there was no way for me to get back my millet seed, which had dropped into the sea, and when I arrived at the place with the holy water I saw the seed had fallen on fruitful soil, and was growing before my eyes. And more than that, it was even cut by an invisible hand, and made into a cake.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='134'>"So I took the cake as well as the holy water, and was flying back with them over the sea, when there fell a great rain, and the sea was swollen, and swept away my millet cake. Ah, how vexed I was at its loss when I was safe on earth again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='135'>"Suddenly I remembered that my hair was very long. If I stood it touched the ground, although if I was sitting it only reached my ears. I seized a knife and cut off a large lock, which I plaited together, and when night came tied it into a knot, and prepared to use it for a pillow. But what was I to do for a fire? A tinder box I had, but no wood. Then it occurred to me that I had stuck a needle in my clothes, so I took the needle and split it in pieces, and lit it, then laid myself down by the fire and went to sleep. But ill-luck still pursued me. While I was sleeping a spark from the fire lighted on the hair, which was burnt up in a moment. In despair I threw myself on the ground, and instantly sank in it as far as my waist. I struggled to get out, but only fell in further; so I ran to the house, seized a spade, dug myself out, and took home the holy water. On the way I noticed that the ripe fields were full of reapers, and suddenly the air became so frightfully hot that the men dropped down in a faint. Then I called to them, "Why don"t you bring out our mare, which is as tall as two days, and as broad as half a day, and make a shade for yourselves?" My father heard what I said and jumped quickly on the mare, and the reapers worked with a will in the shadow, while I snatched up a wooden pail to bring them some water to drink. When I got to the well everything was frozen hard, so in order to draw some water I had to take off my head and break the ice with it. As I drew near them, carrying the water, the reapers all cried out, "Why, what has become of your head?" I put up my hand and discovered that I really had no head, and that I must have left it in the well. I ran back to look for it, but found that meanwhile a fox which was passing by had pulled my head out of the water, and was tearing at my brains. I stole cautiously up to him, and gave him such a kick that he uttered a loud scream, and let fall a parchment on which was written, "The cake is mine, and the beardless one goes empty-handed.""</paragraph>

The difficulties he met with--huge rocks to be climbed, deep rivers to be crossed, and thorny tracts to be avoided--only served to make his heart beat quicker, for he was really brave all through, and not merely when he could not help himself, like a great many people.

After some time he thought that in the midst of all their shrieks he could make out the words, "Do not tell Schippeitaro! Keep it hidden and secret! Do not tell Schippeitaro!" Then, the midnight hour having passed, they all vanished, and the youth was left alone. Exhausted by all that had been going on round him, he flung himself on the ground and slept till the sun rose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='228'>The moment he woke he felt very hungry, and began to think how he could get something to eat. So he got up and walked on, and before he had gone very far was lucky enough to find a little side-path, where he could trace men"s footsteps. He followed the track, and by-and-by came on some scattered huts, beyond which lay a village. Delighted at this discovery, he was about to hasten to the village when he heard a woman"s voice weeping and lamenting, and calling on the men to take pity on her and help her. The sound of her distress made him forget he was hungry, and he strode into the hut to find out for himself what was wrong. But the men whom he asked only shook their heads and told him it was not a matter in which he could give any help, for all this sorrow was caused by the Spirit of the Mountain, to whom every year they were bound to furnish a maiden for him to eat.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='232'>"Schippeitaro is the great dog that belongs to the overseer of our prince," said they; "and he lives not far away." And they began to laugh at the question, which seemed to them so odd and useless.</paragraph>

He next hurried to the hut where the maiden lived, and entreated her parents to shut her up safely in a closet, after which he took Schippeitaro to the cask, and fastened him into it. In the evening he knew that the cask would be placed in the chapel, so he hid himself there and waited.</paragraph>

The monster looked eagerly about him, and his eyes sparkled with joy when he saw the cask. He bounded high into the air with delight and uttered cries of pleasure; then he drew near and undid the bolts.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='240'>Once on a time there were three princes, who had a step-sister. One day they all set out hunting together. When they had gone some way through a thick wood they came on a great grey wolf with three cubs.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='243'>Towards evening they came to a clearing in the wood, where three birches grew at the crossing of three roads. The eldest prince took an arrow, and shot it into the trunk of one of the birch trees. Turning to his brothers he said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='247'>After they had gone a little way along the road they came into a forest, and in one of the deepest glades they suddenly found themselves opposite a castle in which there lived a band of robbers. The prince walked up to the door and knocked. The moment it was opened the beasts rushed in, and each seized on a robber, killed him, and dragged the body down to the cellar. Now, one of the robbers was not really killed, only badly wounded, but he lay quite still and pretended to be dead like the others.

But as soon as his back was turned she forgot what he had said, and having wandered through all the other rooms she went down to the cellar and opened the door. As soon as she looked in the robber who had only pretended to be dead sat up and said to her:</paragraph>

Then, when your brother comes back from the wood with his beasts you must go to him and say, "Brother, you are very strong.

Then the prince took counsel with his beasts, and as the dragon approached the shore the fox drew his brush through the water and blinded the dragon by scattering the salt water in his eyes, while the bear and the lion threw up more water with their paws, so that the monster was bewildered and could see nothing.

And it seemed to him as if he heard a faint sound far off, but he did not know from what direction it came. So he blew on his hunting horn and listened again. And again he heard the sound, and this time it seemed to come from the direction of a fire burning in the wood. So he went towards the fire, and there the old woman was raking sticks and leaves into the embers. And he asked her if he might spend the night beside her fire. But she told him she was afraid of his beasts, and he must first allow her to give each of them a stroke with her rod.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='286'>But he answered her:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='287'>"Certainly not. I am their master, and no one shall strike them but I myself. Give me the rod"; and he touched the fox with it, and in a moment it was turned into stone. Then he knew that the old woman was a witch, and he turned to her and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='292'>THE GOAT"S EARS OF THE EMPEROR TROJAN</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='293'>Once upon a time there lived an emperor whose name was Trojan, and he had ears like a goat. Every morning, when he was shaved, he asked if <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='emperor;anything;s;death;barber;ear;goat' adjectives='fresh;odd' verbs='shave;be;put;see;have;ask;reply;order' valence='5.3575' arousal='3.7195' dominance='5.6855'>the man</entity> saw anything odd about him, and as each fresh barber always replied that the emperor had goat"s ears, he was at once ordered to be put to death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='294'>Now after this state of things had lasted a good while, there was hardly a barber left in the town that could shave the emperor, and it came to be the turn of the Master of the Company of Barbers to go up to the palace. But, unluckily, at the very moment that he should have set out, the master fell suddenly ill, and told one of his apprentices that he must go in his stead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='295'>When the youth was taken to the emperor"s bedroom, he was asked why he had come and not his master. The young man replied that the master was ill, and there was no one but himself who could be trusted with the honour. The emperor was satisfied with the answer, and sat down, and let a sheet of fine linen be put round him. Directly the young barber began his work, he, like the rest, remarked the goat"s ears of the emperor, but when he had finished and the emperor asked his usual question as to whether the youth had noticed anything odd about him, the young man replied calmly, "No, nothing at all." This pleased the emperor so much that he gave him twelve ducats, and said, "Henceforth you shall come every day to shave me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='296'>So when the apprentice returned home, and the master inquired how he had got on with the emperor, the young man answered, "Oh, very well, and he says I am to shave him every day, and he has given me these twelve ducats"; but he said nothing about the goat"s ears of the emperor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='297'>From this time the apprentice went regularly up to the palace, receiving each morning twelve ducats in payment. But after a while, his secret, which he had carefully kept, burnt within him, and he longed to tell it to somebody. His master saw there was something on his mind, and asked what it was. The youth replied that he had been tormenting himself for some months, and should never feel easy until some one shared his secret.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='298'>"Well, trust me," said the master, "I will keep it to myself; or, if you do not like to do that, confess it to your pastor, or go into some field outside the town and dig a hole, and, after you have dug it, kneel down and whisper your secret three times into the hole. Then put back <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='put;come' valence='5.58' arousal='3.765' dominance='5.6975'>the earth</entity> and come away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='299'>The apprentice thought that this seemed the best plan, and that very afternoon went to a meadow outside the town, dug a deep hole, then knelt and whispered to it three times over, "The Emperor Trojan has goat"s ears." And as he said so a great burden seemed to roll off him, and he shovelled <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='home;burden' adjectives='great' verbs='say;shovel;run;seem;roll' valence='5.71909090909' arousal='4.07454545455' dominance='5.53181818182'>the earth</entity> carefully back and ran lightly home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='300'>Weeks passed away, and there sprang up in the hole an elder tree which had three stems, all as straight as poplars. Some shepherds, tending their flocks near by, noticed the tree growing there, and one of them cut down a stem to make flutes of; but, directly he began to play, the flute would do nothing but sing: "The Emperor Trojan has goat"s ears." Of course, it was not long before the whole town knew of this wonderful flute and what it said; and, at last, the news reached the emperor in his palace. He instantly sent for the apprentice and said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='301'>"What have you been saying about me to all my people?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='302'>The culprit tried to defend himself by saying that he had never told anyone what he had noticed; but the emperor, instead of listening, only drew his sword from its sheath, which so frightened the poor fellow that he confessed exactly what he had done, and how he had whispered the truth three times to the earth, and how in that very place an elder tree had sprung up, and flutes had been cut from it, which would only repeat the words he had said. Then the emperor commanded his coach to be made ready, and he took the youth with him, and they drove to the spot, for he wished to see for himself whether the young man"s confession was true; but when they reached the place only one stem was left. So the emperor desired his attendants to cut him a flute from the remaining stem, and, when it was ready, he ordered his chamberlain to play on it. But no tune could the chamberlain play, though he was the best flute player about the court--nothing came but the words, "The Emperor Trojan has goat"s ears." Then the emperor knew that even <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='secret;emperor;barber;life;man' adjectives='young;more' verbs='be;grant;know;allow;give' valence='6.11454545455' arousal='4.07636363636' dominance='5.67'>the earth</entity> gave up its secrets, and he granted the young man his life, but he never allowed him to be his barber any more.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='306'>Once upon a time there stood before the palace of an emperor a golden apple tree, which blossomed and bore fruit each night. But every morning the fruit was gone, and the boughs were bare of blossom, without anyone being able to discover who was the thief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='307'>At last the emperor said to his eldest son, "If only I could prevent those robbers from stealing my fruit, how happy I should be!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='308'>And his son replied, "I will sit up to-night and watch <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='to-night;son' adjectives='' verbs='be;reply;see;watch;sit' valence='5.95909090909' arousal='3.71363636364' dominance='5.82'>the tree</entity>, and I shall soon see who it is!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='309'>So directly it grew dark the young man went and hid himself near the apple tree to begin his watch, but the apples had scarcely begun to ripen before he fell asleep, and when he awoke at sunrise the apples were gone. He felt very much ashamed of himself, and went with lagging feet to tell his father!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='310'>Of course, though the eldest son had failed, the second made sure that he would do better, and set out gaily at nightfall to watch the apple tree. But no sooner had he lain himself down than his eyes grew heavy, and when the sunbeams roused him from his slumbers there was not an apple left on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sunbeam;eye;apple;slumber' adjectives='heavy' verbs='lie;be;leave;have;rouse;grow' valence='5.61916666667' arousal='3.69833333333' dominance='5.29583333333'>the tree</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='311'>Next came the turn of the youngest son, who made himself a comfortable bed under the apple tree, and prepared himself to sleep. Towards midnight he awoke, and sat up to look at the tree. And behold! the apples were beginning to ripen, and lit up the whole palace with their brightness. At the same moment nine golden pea-hens flew swiftly through the air, and while eight alighted upon the boughs laden with fruit, the ninth fluttered to the ground where the prince lay, and instantly was changed into a beautiful maiden, more beautiful far than any lady in the emperor"s court. The prince at once fell in love with her, and they talked together for some time, till the maiden said her sisters had finished plucking the apples, and now they must all go home again. The prince, however, begged her so hard to leave him a little of the fruit that the maiden gave him two apples, one for himself and one for his father. Then she changed herself back into a pea-hen, and the whole nine flew away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='312'>As soon as the sun rose the prince entered the palace, and held out the apple to his father, who was rejoiced to see it, and praised his youngest son heartily for his cleverness. That evening the prince returned to the apple tree, and everything passed as before, and so it happened for several nights. At length the other brothers grew angry at seeing that he never came back without bringing two golden apples with him, and they went to consult an old witch, who promised to spy after him, and discover how he managed to get the apples. So, when the evening came, the old woman hid herself under the tree and waited for the prince. Before long he arrived and laid down on his bed, and was soon fast asleep. Towards midnight there was a rush of wings, and the eight pea-hens settled on the tree, while the ninth became a maiden, and ran to greet the prince. Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sister;instant;lock;bough;pea-hen;hair;s;hand;wing' adjectives='maiden' verbs='fly;be;cut;stretch;spring;spread;strip' valence='5.55523809524' arousal='4.55857142857' dominance='5.50714285714'>the witch</entity> stretched out her hand, and cut off a lock of the maiden"s hair, and in an instant <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sister;instant;lock;bough;pea-hen;hair;s;hand;wing' adjectives='maiden' verbs='fly;be;cut;stretch;spring;spread;strip' valence='5.55523809524' arousal='4.55857142857' dominance='5.50714285714'>the girl</entity> sprang up, a pea-hen once more, spread her wings and flew away, while her sisters, who were busily stripping the boughs, flew after her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='313'>When he had recovered from his surprise at the unexpected disappearance of the maiden, the prince exclaimed, "What can be the matter?" and, looking about him, discovered the old witch hidden under the bed. He dragged her out, and in his fury called his guards, and ordered them to put her to death as fast as possible. But that did no good as far as the pea-hens went. They never came back any more, though the prince returned to the tree every night, and wept his heart out for his lost love. This went on for some time, till the prince could bear it no longer, and made up his mind he would search the world through for her. In vain his father tried to persuade him that his task was hopeless, and that other girls were to be found as beautiful as this one. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;servant;quest' adjectives='' verbs='set;accompany;listen' valence='5.66375' arousal='3.98875' dominance='5.45'>The prince</entity> would listen to nothing, and, accompanied by only one servant, set out on his quest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='314'>After travelling for many days, he arrived at length before a large gate, and through the bars he could see the streets of a town, and even the palace. The prince tried to pass in, but the way was barred by the keeper of the gate, who wanted to know who he was, why he was there, and how he had learnt the way, and he was not allowed to enter unless the empress herself came and gave him leave. A message was sent to her, and when she stood at the gate the prince thought he had lost his wits, for there was the maiden he had left his home to seek. And she hastened to him, and took his hand, and drew him into the palace. In a few days they were married, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mind;father;brother' adjectives='' verbs='be;forget;die;marry;live;make' valence='5.82857142857' arousal='4.58357142857' dominance='5.33428571429'>the prince</entity> forgot his father and his brothers, and made up his mind that he would live and die in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mind;father;brother' adjectives='' verbs='be;forget;die;marry;live;make' valence='5.82857142857' arousal='4.58357142857' dominance='5.33428571429'>the castle</entity>.</paragraph>

He made all the haste he could, and just as he reached the great gates out came the nurse with the royal baby, who stretched out his arms to his father. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='baby;nurse' adjectives='' verbs='take;shrink;order' valence='5.35428571429' arousal='3.96857142857' dominance='5.19428571429'>The king</entity> shrank back, and ordered the nurse to take the baby away at once.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='490'>When the king"s anger was spent, and he was able to think what was best to be done, he exchanged his baby, a beautiful boy, for the daughter of a peasant, and the prince lived roughly as the son of poor people, while the little girl slept in a golden cradle, under silken sheets. At the end of a year, the stranger arrived to claim his property, and took away the little girl, believing her to be the true child of the king. The king was so delighted with the success of his plan that he ordered a great feast to be got ready, and gave splendid presents to the foster parents of his son, so that he might lack nothing. But he did not dare to bring back the baby, lest the trick should be found out. The peasants were quite contented with this arrangement, which gave them food and money in abundance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='491'>By-and-by the boy grew big and tall, and seemed to lead a happy life in the house of his foster parents. But a shadow hung over him which really poisoned most of his pleasure, and that was the thought of the poor innocent girl who had suffered in his stead, for his foster father had told him in secret, that he was the king"s son. And the prince determined that when he grew old enough he would travel all over the world, and never rest till he had set her free. To become king at the cost of a maiden"s life was too heavy a price to pay. So one day he put on the dress of a farm servant, threw a sack of peas on his back, and marched straight into the forest where eighteen years before his father had lost himself. After he had walked some way he began to cry loudly: "Oh, how unlucky I am! Where can I be? Is there no one to show me <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;show' valence='5.81833333333' arousal='3.6' dominance='5.515'>the way</entity> out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;show' valence='5.81833333333' arousal='3.6' dominance='5.515'>the wood</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='492'>Then appeared a strange man with a long grey beard, with a leather bag hanging from his girdle.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='493'>"What can a beggar such as I promise you?" answered the prince. "I have nothing to give you save my life; even the coat on my back belongs to my master, whom I serve for my keep and my clothes."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='494'>The stranger looked at the sack of peas, and said, "But you must possess something; you are carrying this sack, which seems to be very heavy."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='495'>"It is full of peas," was the reply. "My old aunt died last night, without leaving money enough to buy peas to give the watchers, as is the custom throughout the country. I have borrowed these peas from my master, and thought to take a short cut across <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cut;master;pea' adjectives='short' verbs='borrow;see;take;have;lose;think' valence='5.35666666667' arousal='4.25066666667' dominance='5.198'>the forest</entity>; but I have lost myself, as you see."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='496'>"Then you are an orphan?" asked the stranger. "Why should you not enter my service?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='497'>"Why not, indeed, if we can strike a bargain?" said the other. "I was born a peasant, and strange bread is always bitter, so it is the same to me whom I serve! What wages will you give me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='498'>"Every day fresh food, meat twice a week, butter and vegetables, your summer and winter clothes, and a portion of land for your own use."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='499'>"I shall be satisfied with that," said the youth. "Somebody else will have to bury my aunt. I will go with you!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='500'>Now this bargain seemed to please the old fellow so much that he spun round like a top, and sang so loud that the whole wood rang with his voice. Then he set out with his companion, and chattered so fast that he never noticed that his new servant kept dropping peas out of the sack. At night they slept under a fig tree, and when the sun rose started on their way. About noon they came to a large stone, and here the old fellow stopped, looked carefully round, gave a sharp whistle, and stamped three times on the ground with his left foot. Suddenly there appeared under the stone a secret door, which led to what looked like the mouth of a cave. The old fellow seized the youth by the arm, and said roughly, "Follow me!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='501'>Thick darkness surrounded them, yet it seemed to the prince as if their path led into still deeper depths. After a long while he thought he saw a glimmer of light, but the light was neither that of the sun nor of the moon. He looked eagerly at it, but found it was only a kind of pale cloud, which was all the light this strange underworld could boast. Earth and water, trees and plants, birds and beasts, each was different from those he had seen before; but what most struck terror into his heart was the absolute stillness that reigned everywhere. Not a rustle or a sound could be heard. Here and there he noticed a bird sitting on a branch, with head erect and swelling throat, but his ear caught nothing. The dogs opened their mouths as if to bark, the toiling oxen seemed about to bellow, but neither bark nor bellow reached the prince. The water flowed noiselessly over the pebbles, the wind bowed the tops of the trees, flies and chafers darted about, without breaking the silence. The old greybeard uttered no word, and when his companion tried to ask him the meaning of it all he felt that his voice died in his throat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='502'>How long this fearful stillness lasted I do not know, but the prince gradually felt his heart turning to ice, his hair stood up like bristles, and a cold chill was creeping down his spine, when at last--oh, ecstasy!--a faint noise broke on his straining ears, and this life of shadows suddenly became real. It sounded as if a troop of horses were ploughing their way over a moor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>Then the greybeard opened his mouth, and said: "The kettle is boiling; we are expected at home."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='504'>They walked on a little further, till <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grandmother;saw;guide;saw-mill;dozen' adjectives='further;little' verbs='be;snore;work;grind;observe;hear;sleep;walk;think;listen' valence='5.76789473684' arousal='3.92210526316' dominance='5.41526315789'>the prince</entity> thought he heard the grinding of a saw-mill, as if dozens of saws were working together, but his guide observed, "The grandmother is sleeping soundly; listen how she snores."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='505'>When they had climbed a hill which lay before them the prince saw in the distance the house of his master, but it was so surrounded with buildings of all kinds that the place looked more like a village or even a small town. They reached it at last, and found an empty kennel standing in front of the gate. "Creep inside this," said the master, "and wait while I go in and see my grandmother. Like all very old people, she is very obstinate, and cannot bear fresh faces about her."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='506'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kennel;scrape' adjectives='daring' verbs='have;bring;begin;regret;creep' valence='4.90666666667' arousal='4.42222222222' dominance='5.33222222222'>The prince</entity> crept tremblingly into the kennel, and began to regret the daring which had brought him into this scrape.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='507'>By-and-by the master came back, and called him from his hiding-place. Something had put out his temper, for with a frown he said, "Watch carefully our ways in the house, and beware of making any mistake, or it will go ill with you. Keep your eyes and ears open, and your mouth shut, obey without questions. Be grateful if you will, but never speak unless you are spoken to."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='508'>When the prince stepped over the threshold he caught sight of a maiden of wonderful beauty, with brown eyes and fair curly hair. "Well!" the young man said to himself, "if the old fellow has many daughters like that I should not mind being his son-in-law. This one is just what I admire"; and he watched her lay the table, bring in the food, and take her seat by the fire as if she had never noticed that a strange man was present. Then she took out a needle and thread, and began to darn her stockings. The master sat at table alone, and invited neither his new servant nor the maid to eat with him. Neither was the old grandmother anywhere to be seen. His appetite was tremendous: he soon cleared all the dishes, and ate enough to satisfy a dozen men. When at last he could eat no more he said to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pot;dog;dinner;iron;piece;bone' adjectives='own;last' verbs='be;give;leave;say;take;pick;eat' valence='6.04' arousal='4.176' dominance='5.84733333333'>the girl</entity>, "Now you can pick up the pieces, and take what is left in the iron pot for your own dinner, but give the bones to the dog."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='509'>The prince did not at all like the idea of dining off scraps, which he helped the girl to pick up, but, after all, he found that there was plenty to eat, and that the food was very good. During the meal he stole many glances at the maiden, and would even have spoken to her, but she gave him no encouragement. Every time he opened his mouth for the purpose she looked at him sternly, as if to say, "Silence," so he could only let his eyes speak for him. Besides, the master was stretched on a bench by the oven after his huge meal, and would have heard everything.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='510'>After supper that night, the old man said to the prince, "For two days you may rest from the fatigues of the journey, and look about the house. But the day after to-morrow you must come with me, and I will point out the work you have to do. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;sleep;show' valence='6.002' arousal='3.444' dominance='5.888'>The maid</entity> will show you where you are to sleep."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='513'>The girl made a sign to him to follow her, and, throwing open a door, nodded to him to go in. He would have lingered a moment, for he thought she looked sad, but dared not do so, for fear of the old man"s anger.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='514'>"It is impossible that she can be his daughter!" he said to himself, "for she has a kind heart. I am quite sure she must be the same girl who was brought here instead of me, so I am bound to risk my head in this mad adventure." He got into bed, but it was long before he fell asleep, and even then his dreams gave him no rest. He seemed to be surrounded by dangers, and it was only the power of the maiden who helped him through it all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='515'>When he woke his first thoughts were for the girl, whom he found hard at work. He drew water from the well and carried it to the house for her, kindled the fire under the iron pot, and, in fact, did everything that came into his head that could be of any use to her. In the afternoon he went out, in order to learn something of his new home, and wondered greatly not to come across the old grandmother. In his rambles he came to the farmyard, where a beautiful white horse had a stall to itself; in another was a black cow with two white-faced calves, while the clucking of geese, ducks, and hens reached him from a distance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='516'>Breakfast, dinner, and supper were as savoury as before, and the prince would have been quite content with his quarters had it not been for the difficulty of keeping silence in the presence of the maiden. On the evening of the second day he went, as he had been told, to receive his orders for the following morning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='517'>"I am going to set you something very easy to do to-morrow," said the old man when his servant entered. "Take this scythe and cut as much grass as the white horse will want for its day"s feed, and clean out its stall. If I come back and find the manger empty it will go ill with you. So beware!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='518'>The prince left the room, rejoicing in his heart, and saying to himself, "Well, I shall soon get through that!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='519'>He was just going to open his door, when the maiden glided softly past and whispered in his ear: "What task has he set you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='520'>"For to-morrow," answered the prince, "it is really nothing at all! Just to cut hay for the horse, and to clean out his stall!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='521'>"Oh, luckless being!" sighed the girl; "how will you ever get through with it. The white horse, who is our master"s grandmother, is always hungry: it takes twenty men always mowing to keep it in food for one day, and another twenty to clean out its stall. How, then, do you expect to do it all by yourself? But listen to me, and do what I tell you. It is your only chance. When you have filled the manger as full as it will hold you must weave a strong plait of the rushes which grow among the meadow hay, and cut a thick peg of stout wood, and be sure that the horse sees what you are doing. Then it will ask you what it is for, and you will say, "With this plait I intend to bind up your mouth so that you cannot eat any more, and with this peg I am going to keep you still in one spot, so that you cannot scatter your corn and water all over the place!" After these words the maiden went away as softly as she had come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='522'>Early the next morning he set to work. His scythe danced through the grass much more easily than he had hoped, and soon he had enough to fill the manger. He put it in the crib, and returned with a second supply, when to his horror he found the crib empty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='523'>Then he knew that without the maiden"s advice he would certainly have been lost, and began to put it into practice. He took out the rushes which had somehow got mixed up with the hay, and plaited them quickly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='524'>"My son, what are you doing?" asked the horse wonderingly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='525'>"Oh, nothing!" replied he. "Just weaving a chin strap to bind your jaws together, in case you might wish to eat any more!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='526'>The white horse sighed deeply when it heard this, and made up its mind to be content with what it had eaten.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='527'>The youth next began to clean out the stall, and the horse knew it had found a master; and by mid-day there was still fodder in the manger, and the place was as clean as a new pin.

Place the pan on the floor of the stall, and the tongs on the fire, and blow with all your might, till the coals burn brightly.

Lay the doll in a basket lined with soft wool, and leave it alone, for it will not need any food, and by-and-by you will find it has grown to be the size of a baby.

Feeling a different being from the poor sad woman who had wandered into the garden so short a time before, she hastened to her room, and felt carefully in the basket for the egg. There it was, a tiny thing of soft blue with little green spots, and she took it out and kept it in her bosom, which was the warmest place she could think of.</paragraph>

Her face could not be seen, for a veil covered her head, but as she came up to the place where the queen was standing with the babies she drew the veil aside, and everyone was dazzled with her beauty. She took the little girl in her arms, and holding it up before the assembled company announced that henceforward it would be known by the name of Dotterine--a name which no one understood but the queen, who knew that the baby had come from the yolk of an egg. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;call' valence='6.06666666667' arousal='3.61' dominance='5.53666666667'>The boy</entity> was called <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;call' valence='6.06666666667' arousal='3.61' dominance='5.53666666667'>Willem</entity>.</paragraph>

To her, as her most faithful servant, she gave the lucky basket in charge, and besought her to treasure it carefully. "When my daughter," said the queen, "is ten years old, you are to hand it over to her, but warn her solemnly that her whole future happiness depends on the way she guards it. About my son, I have no fears. He is the heir of the kingdom, and his father will look after him."

	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='791'>Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kioto.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='792'>So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kioto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other. The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about travelling, and half way between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed. It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another frog before him! They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes. It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their ways.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='795'>This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his front paws on the shoulders of his friend, who had risen also.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='815'>"Never mind that," said the gazelle, "but listen to what I say! First, I took you for my master. Second, you gave for me all you had in the world.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='819'>And the man replied, "Go, my son," but he felt very lonely without his gazelle, and set out sooner than usual for the dust-heap where he generally found most corn. And glad he was when the evening came, and he could return home. He lay on the grass chewing tobacco, when the gazelle trotted up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='820'>"Good evening, my master; how have you fared all day?

But, instead, it saw something lying in the earth, which turned out to be a diamond, very large and bright. "Oh, ho!" said the gazelle to itself, "perhaps now I can do something for my master who bought me with all the money he had; but I must be careful or they will say he has stolen it. I had better take it myself to some great rich man, and see what it will do for me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='822'>Directly the gazelle had come to this conclusion, it picked up the diamond in its mouth, and went on and on and on through the forest, but found no place where a rich man was likely to dwell.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='823'>The people were standing about the streets doing their marketing, when the gazelle bounded past, the diamond flashing as it ran.

And the gazelle galloped up to him, and laid the diamond at his feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='824'>The sultan looked first at the diamond and next at the gazelle; then he ordered his attendants to bring cushions and a carpet, that the gazelle might rest itself after its long journey.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1122'>Long, long ago an old couple lived in a village, and, as they had no children to love and care for, they gave all their affection to a little dog. He was a pretty little creature, and instead of growing spoilt and disagreeable at not getting everything he wanted, as even children will do sometimes, the dog was grateful to them for their kindness, and never left their side, whether they were in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='dog;everything;child;kindness;side;creature' adjectives='disagreeable;little;spoilt;grateful' verbs='do;be;get;leave;want;grow' valence='6.065' arousal='4.1245' dominance='5.7755'>the house</entity> or out of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1123'>One day the old man was working in his garden, with his dog, as usual, close by. The morning was hot, and at last he put down his spade and wiped his wet forehead, noticing, as he did so, that the animal was snuffling and scratching at a spot a little way off. There was nothing very strange in this, as all dogs are fond of scratching, and he went on quietly with his digging, when the dog ran up to his master, barking loudly, and back again to the place where he had been scratching. This he did several times, till the old man wondered what could be the matter, and, picking up the spade, followed where the dog led him. The dog was so delighted at his success that he jumped round, barking loudly, till the noise brought the old woman out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='woman;noise;dog;success;round' adjectives='old;delighted' verbs='jump;be;bark;bring' valence='6.00916666667' arousal='4.41416666667' dominance='5.575'>the house</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1124'>Curious to know if the dog had really found anything, the husband began to dig, and very soon the spade struck against something. He stooped down and pulled out a large box, filled quite full with shining gold pieces. The box was so heavy that the old woman had to help to carry it home, and you may guess what a supper the dog had that night! Now that he had made them rich, they gave him every day all that a dog likes best to eat, and the cushions on which he lay were fit for a prince.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1125'>The story of the dog and his treasure soon became known, and a neighbour whose garden was next the old people"s grew so envious of their good luck that he could neither eat nor sleep. As the dog had discovered a treasure once, this foolish man thought he must be able to discover one always, and begged the old couple to lend him their pet for a little while, so that he might be made rich also.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1126'>"How can you ask such a thing?" answered the old man indignantly.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1128'>But the envious neighbour would not heed his words, and came daily with the same request, till at last the old people, who could not bear to say no to anyone, promised to lend the dog, just for a night or two.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1129'>The next morning the man opened the house door, and the dog bounded joyfully into the garden, and, running up to the foot of a tree, began to scratch wildly. The man called loudly to his wife to bring a spade, and followed the dog, as he longed to catch the first glimpse of the expected treasure. But when he had dug up the ground, what did he find? Why, nothing but a parcel of old bones, which smelt so badly that he could not stay there a moment longer. And his heart was filled with rage against the dog who had played him this trick, and he seized a pickaxe and killed it on the spot, before he knew what he was doing. When he remembered that he would have to go with his story to the old man and his wife he was rather frightened, but there was nothing to be gained by putting it off, so he pulled a very long face and went to his neighbour"s garden.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1130'>"Your dog," said he, pretending to weep, "has suddenly fallen down dead, though I took every care of him, and gave him everything he could wish for. And I thought I had better come straight and tell you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1131'>Weeping bitterly, the old man went to fetch the body of his favourite, and brought it home and buried it under the fig-tree where he had found the treasure. From morning till night he and his wife mourned over their loss, and nothing could comfort them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1132'>At length, one night when he was asleep, he dreamt that the dog appeared to him and told him to cut down the fig-tree over his grave, and out of its wood to make a mortar. But when the old man woke and thought of his dream he did not feel at all inclined to cut down the tree, which bore well every year, and consulted his wife about it. The woman did not hesitate a moment, and said that after what had happened before, the dog"s advice must certainly be obeyed, so the tree was felled, and a beautiful mortar made from it. And when the season came for the rice crop to be gathered the mortar was taken down from its shelf, and the grains placed in it for pounding, when, lo and behold! in a twinkling of an eye, they all turned into gold pieces. At the sight of all this gold the hearts of the old people were glad, and once more they blessed their faithful dog.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1133'>But it was not long before this story also came to the ears of their envious neighbour, and he lost no time in going to the old people and asking if they happened to have a mortar which they could lend him. The old man did not at all like parting with his precious treasure, but he never could say no, so the neighbour went off with the mortar under his arm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1134'>The moment he got into his own house he took a great handful of rice, and began to shell off the husks, with the help of his wife. But, instead of the gold pieces for which they looked, the rice turned into berries with such a horrible smell that they were obliged to run away, after smashing the mortar in a rage and setting fire to the bits.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1135'>The old people next door were naturally very much put out when they learned the fate of their mortar, and were not at all comforted by the explanations and excuses made by their neighbour. But that night the dog again appeared in a dream to his master, and told him that he must go and collect the ashes of the burnt mortar and bring them home. Then, when he heard that the Daimio, or great lord to whom this part of the country belonged, was expected at the capital, he was to carry the ashes to the high road, through which the procession would have to pass. And as soon as it was in sight he was to climb up all the cherry-trees and sprinkle the ashes on them, and they would soon blossom as they had never blossomed before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1136'>This time the old man did not wait to consult his wife as to whether he was to do what his dog had told him, but directly he got up he went to his neighbour"s house and collected the ashes of the burnt mortar. He put them carefully in a china vase, and carried it to the high road, Sitting down on a seat till the Daimio should pass. The cherry-trees were bare, for it was the season when small pots of them were sold to rich people, who kept them in hot places, so that they might blossom early and decorate their rooms. As to the trees in the open air, no one would ever think of looking for the tiniest bud for more than a month yet. The old man had not been waiting very long before he saw a cloud of dust in the far distance, and knew that it must be the procession of the Daimio. On they came, every man dressed in his finest clothes, and the crowd that was lining the road bowed their faces to the ground as they went by. Only the old man did not bow himself, and the great lord saw this, and bade one of his courtiers, in anger, go and inquire why he had disobeyed the ancient customs. But before the messenger could reach him the old man had climbed the nearest tree and scattered his ashes far and wide, and in an instant the white flowers had flashed into life, and the heart of the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;life;flower;instant;tree;messenger;castle;ash;present;man' adjectives='nearest;white;old;rich' verbs='rejoice;give;flash;reach;send;have;climb;scatter' valence='5.8676' arousal='4.3652' dominance='5.7024'>Daimio</entity> rejoiced, and he gave rich presents to the old man, whom he sent for to his castle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1137'>We may be sure that in a very little while the envious neighbour had heard this also, and his bosom was filled with hate. He hastened to the place where he had burned the mortar, collected a few of the ashes which the old man had left behind, and took them to the road, hoping that his luck might be as good as the old man"s, or perhaps even better. His heart beat with pleasure when he caught the first glimpses of the Daimio"s train, and he held himself ready for the right moment. As the Daimio drew near he flung a great handful of ashes over the trees, but no buds or flowers followed the action: instead, the ashes were all blown back into the eyes of the Daimio and his warriors, till they cried out from pain. Then the prince ordered the evil-doer to be seized and bound and thrown into prison, where he was kept for many months. By the time he was set free everybody in his native village had found out his wickedness, and they would not let him live there any longer; and as he would not leave off his evil ways he soon went from bad to worse, and came to a miserable end.</paragraph>

If they prove shy, and refuse to let you get near them, draw out your knife, and let the sun shine on it so that the whole meadow is lit up by its rays, and the horses will then approach you of their own accord, and will let you lead them away.

Go to it, and cut away the roots with your knife, and you will come to countless bags of gold.

Then he drew his knife, and held it up towards the sun, and directly there shone such a glory that the whole meadow was bathed in it.

Deeper and deeper he dug, till far down, below the roots of brass, his knife struck upon the buried treasure, which lay heaped up in bags all around. With a great effort he lifted them from their hiding place, and laid them one by one on his horses" backs, and when they could carry no more he led them back to the emperor. And when the emperor saw him, he wondered, but never guessed how it was the young man had been too clever for him, till the betrothal ceremony was over. Then he asked his newly made son-in-law what dowry he would require with his bride. To which the bridegroom made answer, "Noble emperor! all I desire is that I may have your daughter for my wife, and enjoy for ever the use of your enchanted knife."</paragraph>

The pearls, he thought, could only be brought by a very wealthy man, and the tasks would require unusual talents to accomplish them.</paragraph>

Some turned up, too, who were mere adventurers, and tried to deceive the old king with imitation pearls; but he was not to be taken in so easily, and they were soon sent about their business.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1502'>In front of the fire three men were sitting clothed in white, just as if it was summer, and for about thirty feet all round winter had been banished. The moss was dry and the plants green, while the grass seemed all alive with the hum of bees and cockchafers. But above the noise the son of Long <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='noise;weight;snow;whistling;son;branch;wind;crackling' adjectives='long' verbs='hear;fall' valence='5.29375' arousal='4.12875' dominance='5.24875'>Hans</entity> could hear the whistling of the wind and the crackling of the branches as they fell beneath the weight of the snow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1503'>"Well! you son of Long Hans, isn"t this more comfortable than your juniper bush?" laughed the stranger, and for answer Hans replied he could not thank his friend enough for having brought him here, and, throwing off his sheepskin, rolled it up as a pillow. Then, after a hot drink which warmed both their hearts, they lay down on the ground. The stranger talked for a little to the other men in a language <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time;language;stranger;man' adjectives='little;other;short' verbs='do;fall;understand;talk;listen' valence='5.594375' arousal='3.94625' dominance='5.3625'>Hans</entity> did not understand, and after listening for a short time he once more fell asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1504'>When he awoke, neither wood nor fire was to be seen, and he did not know where he was. He rubbed his eyes, and began to recall the events of the night, thinking he must have been dreaming; but for all that, he could not make out how he came to be in this place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1505'>Suddenly a loud noise struck on his ear, and he felt the earth tremble beneath his feet. Hans listened for a moment, then resolved to go towards the place where the sound came from, hoping he might come across some human being. He found himself at length at the mouth of a rocky cave in which a fire seemed burning. He entered, and saw a huge forge, and a crowd of men in front of it, blowing bellows and wielding hammers, and to each anvil were seven men, and a set of more comical smiths could not be found if you searched all the world through! Their heads were bigger than their little bodies, and their hammers twice the size of themselves, but the strongest men on earth could not have handled their iron clubs more stoutly or given lustier blows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1506'>The little blacksmiths were clad in leather aprons, which covered them from their necks to their feet in front, and left their backs naked. On a high stool against the wall sat the man with the pinewood staff, watching sharply the way the little fellows did their work, and near him stood a large can, from which every now and then the workers would come and take a drink. The master no longer wore the white garments of the day before, but a black jerkin, held in its place by a leathern girdle with huge clasps.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1507'>From time to time he would give his workmen a sign with his staff, for it was useless to speak amid such a noise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1508'>If any of them had noticed that there was a stranger present they took no heed of him, but went on with what they were doing. After some hours" hard labour came the time for rest, and they all flung their hammers to the ground and trooped out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ground;labour;hammer;rest;time' adjectives='hard' verbs='come;troop;fling' valence='5.536' arousal='3.79' dominance='5.367'>the cave</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1509'>Then the master got down from his seat and said to Hans:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1510'>"I saw you come in, but the work was pressing, and I could not stop to speak to you. To-day you must be my guest, and I will show you something of the way in which I live. Wait here for a moment, while I lay aside these dirty clothes." With these words he unlocked a door in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='door;word' adjectives='' verbs='unlock;bid;pass' valence='5.39857142857' arousal='4.02285714286' dominance='5.56428571429'>the cave</entity>, and bade <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='door;word' adjectives='' verbs='unlock;bid;pass' valence='5.39857142857' arousal='4.02285714286' dominance='5.56428571429'>Hans</entity> pass in before him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1514'>"Why, you have no more power than a flea," laughed the host; "you will have to content yourself with feasting your eyes upon them!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1515'>So he bade Hans follow him through other rooms, till they entered one bigger than a church, filled, like the rest, with gold and silver. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;world;riches;anyone' adjectives='useless;vast' verbs='buy;see;lay;have;bury;think;wonder' valence='5.775' arousal='4.3975' dominance='5.85583333333'>Hans</entity> wondered to see these vast riches, which might have bought all the kingdoms of the world, and lay buried, useless, he thought, to anyone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1516'>"What is the reason," he asked of his guide, "that you gather up these treasures here, where they can do good to nobody? If they fell into the hands of men, everyone would be rich, and none need work or suffer hunger."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1517'>"And it is exactly for that reason," answered he, "that I must keep these riches out of their way. The whole world would sink to idleness if men were not forced to earn their daily bread. It is only through work and care that man can ever hope to be good for anything."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1519'>"I am not really a man," replied his guide, "though I have the outward form of one, but one of those beings to whom is given the care of the world. It is my task and that of my workmen to prepare under the earth the gold and silver, a small portion of which finds its way every year to the upper world, but only just enough to help them carry on their business. To none comes wealth without trouble: we must first dig out the gold and mix the grains with earth, clay, and sand. Then, after long and hard seeking, it will be found in this state, by those who have good luck or much patience. But, my friend, the hour of dinner is at hand. If you wish to remain in this place, and feast your eyes on this gold, then stay till I call you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1520'>In his absence Hans wandered from one treasure chamber to another, sometimes trying to break off a little lump of gold, but never able to do it. After awhile his host came back, but so changed that Hans could not believe it was really he. His silken clothes were of the brightest flame colour, richly trimmed with gold fringes and lace; a golden girdle was round his waist, while his head was encircled with a crown of gold, and precious stones twinkled about him like stars in a winter"s night, and in place of his wooden stick he held a finely worked golden staff.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1521'>The lord of all this treasure locked the doors and put the keys in his pocket, then led Hans into another room, where dinner was laid for them. Table and seats were all of silver, while the dishes and plates were of solid gold. Directly they sat down, a dozen little servants appeared to wait on them, which they did so cleverly and so quickly that Hans could hardly believe they had no wings. As they did not reach as high as the table, they were often obliged to jump and hop right on to the top to get at the dishes. Everything was new to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everything;crown;thing' adjectives='new;many;golden' verbs='enjoy;be;begin;bewilder;hear;have;tell' valence='6.23384615385' arousal='3.99846153846' dominance='5.62692307692'>Hans</entity>, and though he was rather bewildered he enjoyed himself very much, especially when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everything;crown;thing' adjectives='new;many;golden' verbs='enjoy;be;begin;bewilder;hear;have;tell' valence='6.23384615385' arousal='3.99846153846' dominance='5.62692307692'>the man</entity> with the golden crown began to tell him many things he had never heard of before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1522'>"Between Christmas and the New Year," said he, "I often amuse myself by wandering about the earth watching the doings of men and learning something about them. But as far as I have seen and heard I cannot speak well of them. The greater part of them are always quarrelling and complaining of each other"s faults, while nobody thinks of his own."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1523'>Hans tried to deny the truth of these words, but he could not do it, and sat silent, hardly listening to what his friend was saying. Then he went to sleep in his chair, and knew nothing of what was happening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1524'>Wonderful dreams came to him during his sleep, where the bars of gold continually hovered before his eyes. He felt stronger than he had ever felt during his waking moments, and lifted two bars quite easily on to his back. He did this so often that at length his strength seemed exhausted, and he sank almost breathless on the ground. Then he heard the sound of cheerful voices, and the song of the blacksmiths as they blew their bellows--he even felt as if he saw the sparks flashing before his eyes. Stretching himself, he awoke slowly, and here he was in the green forest, and instead of the glow of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='streaming;sun;underworld;forest;glow' adjectives='strange;green' verbs='be;sit;stretch;feel;awake;wonder' valence='5.87928571429' arousal='4.39285714286' dominance='5.55214285714'>the fire</entity> in the underworld the sun was streaming on him, and he sat up wondering why he felt so strange.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1525'>At length his memory came back to him, and as he called to mind all the wonderful things he had seen he tried in vain to make them agree with those that happen every day. After thinking it over till he was nearly mad, he tried at last to believe that one night between Christmas and the New Year he had met a stranger in the forest, and had slept all night in his company before a big fire; the next day they had dined together, and had drunk a great deal more than was good for them--in short, he had spent two whole days revelling with another man. But here, with the full tide of summer around him, he could hardly accept his own explanation, and felt that he must have been the plaything or sport of some magician.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1526'>Near him, in the full sunlight, were the traces of a dead fire, and when he drew close to it he saw that what he had taken for ashes was really fine silver dust, and that the half burnt firewood was made of gold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1527'>Oh, how lucky Hans thought himself; but where should he get a sack to carry his treasure home before anyone else found it? But necessity is the mother of invention: Hans threw off his fur coat, gathered up the silver ashes so carefully in it that none remained behind, laid the gold sticks on top, and tied up the bag thus made with his girdle, so that nothing should fall out. The load was not, in point of fact, very heavy, although it seemed so to his imagination, and he moved slowly along till he found a safe hiding-place for it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1528'>In this way Hans suddenly became rich--rich enough to buy a property of his own. But being a prudent man, he finally decided that it would be best for him to leave his old neighbourhood and look for a home in a distant part of the country, where nobody knew anything about him. It did not take him long to find what he wanted, and after he had paid for it there was plenty of money left over. When he was settled, he married a pretty girl who lived near by, and had some children, to whom on his death-bed he told the story of the lord of the underworld, and how he had made <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lord;girl;underworld;story;child' adjectives='death-bed;rich' verbs='be;marry;live;settle;have;tell;make' valence='6.235' arousal='4.483125' dominance='5.72'>Hans</entity> rich.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1533'>In a large town in Germany there lived, some couple of hundred years ago, a cobbler and his wife. They were poor and hard-working. The man sat all day in a little stall at the street corner and mended any shoes that were brought him. His wife sold the fruit and vegetables they grew in their garden in the Market Place, and as she was always neat and clean and her goods were temptingly spread out she had plenty of customers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1534'>The couple had one boy called Jem. A handsome, pleasant-faced boy of twelve, and tall for his age.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1535'>One day Jem and his mother sat as usual in the Market Place with plenty of nice herbs and vegetables spread out on the board, and in some smaller baskets early pears, apples, and apricots. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='voice;top;wares' adjectives='' verbs='cry' valence='5.24' arousal='4.34333333333' dominance='5.01'>Jem</entity> cried his wares at the top of his voice:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1537'>As he cried an old woman came across the Market Place.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1542'>The cobbler"s wife felt much disgusted at seeing her wares treated like this, but she dared not speak. When the old hag had turned over the whole basket she muttered, "Bad stuff, bad stuff; much better fifty years ago--all bad."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1553'>The little fellow didn"t like this, and began to cry, for he was afraid of the old woman, but his mother ordered him to go, for she thought it wrong not to help such a weakly old creature; so, still crying, he gathered the cabbages into a basket and followed the old woman across the Market Place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1554'>It took her more than half an hour to get to a distant part of the little town, but at last she stopped in front of a small tumble-down house. She drew a rusty old hook from her pocket and stuck it into a little hole in the door, which suddenly flew open.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1555'>The old woman took out a silver whistle and blew it till the sound rang through the house. Immediately a lot of guinea pigs came running down the stairs, but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fashion;stair;leg;guinea;pig;s;shoe;lot;clothes;hat;nutshell;man' adjectives='newest;odd;hind' verbs='be;run;walk;wear;put;come;think' valence='5.6519047619' arousal='3.84428571429' dominance='5.56'>Jem</entity> thought it rather odd that they all walked on their hind legs, wore nutshells for shoes, and men"s clothes, whilst even their hats were put on in the newest fashion.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1557'>They rushed upstairs again and returned with a pair of cocoa nuts lined with leather, which she put on her feet. Now all limping and shuffling was at an end. She threw away her stick and walked briskly across the glass floor, drawing little Jem after her. At last she paused in a room which looked almost like a kitchen, it was so full of pots and pans, but the tables were of mahogany and the sofas and chairs covered with the richest stuffs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1558'>"Sit down," said the old woman pleasantly, and she pushed Jem into a corner of a sofa and put a table close in front of him. "Sit down, you"ve had a long walk and a heavy load to carry, and I must give you something for your trouble. Wait a bit, and I"ll give you some nice soup, which you"ll remember as long as you live."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1559'>So saying, she whistled again. First came in guinea pigs in men"s clothing. They had tied on large kitchen aprons, and in their belts were stuck carving knives and sauce ladles and such things. After them hopped in a number of squirrels. They too walked on their hind legs, wore full Turkish trousers, and little green velvet caps on their heads. They seemed to be the scullions, for they clambered up the walls and brought down pots and pans, eggs, flour, butter, and herbs, which they carried to the stove. Here the old woman was bustling about, and Jem could see that she was cooking something very special for him. At last the broth began to bubble and boil, and she drew off the saucepan and poured its contents into a silver bowl, which she set before <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='broth;bowl;contents;saucepan;bubble;silver;boil' adjectives='last' verbs='begin;set;draw;pour' valence='5.76454545455' arousal='3.76181818182' dominance='5.85363636364'>Jem</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1560'>"There, my boy," said she, "eat this soup and then you"ll have everything which pleased you so much about me. And you shall be a clever cook too, but the real herb--no, the REAL herb you"ll never find. Why had your mother not got it in her basket?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1561'>The child could not think what she was talking about, but he quite understood the soup, which tasted most delicious. His mother had often given him nice things, but nothing had ever seemed so good as this. The smell of the herbs and spices rose from the bowl, and the soup tasted both sweet and sharp at the same time, and was very strong. As he was finishing it the guinea pigs lit some Arabian incense, which gradually filled the room with clouds of blue vapour. They grew thicker and thicker and the scent nearly overpowered the boy. He reminded himself that he must get back to his mother, but whenever he tried to rouse himself to go he sank back again drowsily, and at last he fell sound asleep in the corner of the sofa.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1562'>Strange dreams came to him. He thought the old woman took off all his clothes and wrapped him up in a squirrel skin, and that he went about with the other squirrels and guinea pigs, who were all very pleasant and well mannered, and waited on the old woman.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1563'>First he learned to clean her cocoa-nut shoes with oil and to rub them up. Then he learnt to catch the little sun moths and rub them through the finest sieves, and the flour from them he made into soft bread for the toothless old woman.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1564'>In this way he passed from one kind of service to another, spending a year in each, till in the fourth year he was promoted to the kitchen. Here he worked his way up from under-scullion to head-pastrycook, and reached the greatest perfection. He could make all the most difficult dishes, and two hundred different kinds of patties, soup flavoured with every sort of herb--he had learnt it all, and learnt it well and quickly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1565'>When he had lived seven years with the old woman she ordered him one day, as she was going out, to kill and pluck a chicken, stuff it with herbs, and have it very nicely roasted by the time she got back. He did this quite according to rule. He wrung the chicken"s neck, plunged it into boiling water, carefully plucked out all the feathers, and rubbed the skin nice and smooth. Then he went to fetch the herbs to stuff it with. In the store-room he noticed a half-opened cupboard which he did not remember having seen before. He peeped in and saw a lot of baskets from which came a strong and pleasant smell. He opened one and found a very uncommon herb in it. The stems and leaves were a bluish green, and above them was a little flower of a deep bright red, edged with yellow. He gazed at the flower, smelt it, and found it gave the same strong strange perfume which came from the soup the old woman had made him. But the smell was so sharp that he began to sneeze again and again, and at last--he woke up!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1566'>There he lay on the old woman"s sofa and stared about him in surprise. "Well, what odd dreams one does have to be sure!" he said to himself. "Why, I could have sworn I had been a squirrel, a companion of guinea pigs and such creatures, and had become a great cook, too. How mother will laugh when I tell her!

"What a long nose he has, and see how his head is stuck in between his shoulders, and only look at his ugly brown hands!"

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1631'>"Why," cried the astonished cook, "where did you learn cooking? Yes, those are the exact materials, but we never used the herb heal-well, which, I am sure, must be an improvement."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1632'>And now Jem was allowed to try his hand. He could not nearly reach up to the kitchen range, but by putting a wide plank on two chairs he managed very well.

At last, when all was ready, Jem ordered the two dishes to be put on the fire till he gave the word. Then he began to count: "One, two, three," till he got to five hundred when he cried, "Now!"

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1636'>"It is a strange story, your highness," said the cook, and told him the whole matter, which surprised the duke so much that he sent for the dwarf and asked him many questions.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1650'>Quite frightened, the dwarf set down the cage, and the goose gazed at him with sad wise-looking eyes and sighed again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1651'>"Good gracious!" said Long Nose. "So you can speak, Mistress Goose. I never should have thought it! Well, don"t be anxious. I know better than to hurt so rare a bird. But I could bet you were not always in this plumage--wasn"t I a squirrel myself for a time?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1652'>"You are right," said the goose, "in supposing I was not born in this horrid shape. Ah! no one ever thought that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='table;daughter;weatherbold' adjectives='great;ducal' verbs='be;kill;think' valence='5.80875' arousal='4.1275' dominance='5.53875'>Mimi</entity>, the daughter of the great Weatherbold, would be killed for the ducal table."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1653'>"Be quite easy, Mistress Mimi," comforted Jem. "As sure as I"m an honest man and assistant head cook to his highness, no one shall harm you. I will make a hutch for you in my own rooms, and you shall be well fed, and I"ll come and talk to you as much as I can. I"ll tell all the other cooks that I am fattening up a goose on very special food for the grand duke, and at the first good opportunity I will set you free."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1654'>The goose thanked him with tears in her eyes, and the dwarf kept his word. He killed the other two geese for dinner, but built a little shed for Mimi in one of his rooms, under the pretence of fattening her under his own eye. He spent all his spare time talking to her and comforting her, and fed her on all the daintiest dishes. They confided their histories to each other, and Jem learnt that the goose was the daughter of the wizard Weatherbold, who lived on the island of Gothland. He fell out with an old fairy, who got the better of him by cunning and treachery, and to revenge herself turned his daughter into a goose and carried her off to this distant place. When Long Nose told her his story she said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1655'>"I know a little of these matters, and what you say shows me that you are under a herb enchantment--that is to say, that if you can find the herb whose smell woke you up the spell would be broken."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1657'>About this time the grand duke had a visit from a neighbouring prince, a friend of his. He sent for Long Nose and said to him:</paragraph>

This prince who is staying with me has better dinners than any one except myself, and is a great judge of cooking. As long as he is here you must take care that my table shall be served in a manner to surprise him constantly. At the same time, on pain of my displeasure, take care that no dish shall appear twice. Get everything you wish and spare nothing. If you want to melt down gold and precious stones, do so. I would rather be a poor man than have to blush before him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1659'>The dwarf bowed and answered:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1662'>The prince had been a fortnight with the grand duke, and enjoyed himself mightily.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1669'>"Cheer up, my friend. I know the dish quite well: we often had it at home, and I can guess pretty well how it was made."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1680'>The poor dwarf hurried back to his room, and poured out his grief to the goose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1681'>"Oh, is that all," said she, "then I can help you, for my father taught me to know all plants and herbs.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1684'>He did as she bade, and as soon as they were in the garden put her on the ground, when she waddled off as fast as she could towards the lake, Jem hurrying after her with an anxious heart, for he knew that his life depended on her success.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1685'>Suddenly the dwarf noticed a big old tree standing alone on the other side of the lake. "Look," cried he, "let us try our luck there."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1687'>The dwarf stood gazing at the plant. It gave out a strong sweet scent, which reminded him of the day of his enchantment. The stems and leaves were a bluish green, and it bore a dark, bright red flower with a yellow edge.</paragraph>

There was no plant and no vegetable which escaped his eye, but he lingered longest of all before his one date tree.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1860'>In a little village in the country of Japan there lived long, long ago a man and his wife. For many years they were happy and prosperous, but bad times came, and at last nothing was left them but their daughter, who was as beautiful as the morning. The neighbours were very kind, and would have done anything they could to help their poor friends, but the old couple felt that since everything had changed they would rather go elsewhere, so one day they set off to bury themselves in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='daughter;anything;couple;neighbour;everything;friend' adjectives='poor;old' verbs='be;set;help;do;feel;take;have;go;bury;change' valence='5.71' arousal='4.03454545455' dominance='5.65681818182'>the country</entity>, taking their daughter with them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1861'>Now the mother and daughter had plenty to do in keeping the house clean and looking after the garden, but the man would sit for hours together gazing straight in front of him, and thinking of the riches that once were his.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1862'>His wife and daughter wept bitterly for his loss, and it was many months before they could take pleasure in anything. Then one morning the mother suddenly looked at the girl, and found that she had grown still more lovely than before. Once her heart would have been glad at the sight, but now that they two were alone in the world she feared some harm might come of it. So, like a good mother, she tried to teach her daughter all she knew, and to bring her up to be always busy, so that she would never have time to think about herself. And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lesson;girl;s;mother' adjectives='good' verbs='be;pass;listen' valence='6.35090909091' arousal='4.32272727273' dominance='5.59090909091'>the girl</entity> was a good girl, and listened to all her mother"s lessons, and so the years passed away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1863'>At last one wet spring the mother caught cold, and though in the beginning she did not pay much attention to it, she gradually grew more and more ill, and knew that she had not long to live. Then she called her daughter and told her that very soon she would be alone in the world; that she must take care of herself, as there would be no one to take care of her. And because it was more difficult for beautiful women to pass unheeded than for others, she bade her fetch a wooden helmet out of the next room, and put it on her head, and pull it low down over her brows, so that nearly the whole of her face should lie in its shadow. The girl did as she was bid, and her beauty was so hidden beneath the wooden cap, which covered up all her hair, that she might have gone through any crowd, and no one would have looked twice at her. And when she saw this the heart of the mother was at rest, and she lay back in her bed and died.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1864'>The girl wept for many days, but by-and-by she felt that, being alone in the world, she must go and get work, for she had only herself to depend upon. There was none to be got by staying where she was, so she made her clothes into a bundle, and walked over the hills till she reached the house of the man who owned the fields in that part of the country. And she took service with him and laboured for him early and late, and every night when she went to bed she was at peace, for she had not forgotten one thing that she had promised her mother; and, however hot the sun might be, she always kept the wooden helmet on her head, and the people gave her the nickname of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='helmet;head;service;people;sun;peace;bed;thing;mother;nickname' adjectives='wooden;hot' verbs='be;forget;give;keep;labour;promise;take;have;go' valence='6.0572' arousal='3.9956' dominance='5.508'>Hatschihime</entity>.</paragraph>

But the girl would have nothing to say to them, and only bade them be off; then they began to talk to her, but she never answered them, and went on with what she was doing, though her wages were low and food not very plentiful. Still she could manage to live, and that was enough.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1866'>One day her master happened to pass through the field where she was working, and was struck by her industry and stopped to watch her. After a while he put one or two questions to her, and then led her into his house, and told her that henceforward her only duty should be to tend his sick wife.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1867'>Not very long after Hatschihime had become maid to the sick woman, the eldest son of the house returned home from Kioto, where he had been studying all sorts of things.

The helmet was pushed on one side, and as the youth stood watching from behind a tree he had a glimpse of the girl"s great beauty; and he determined that no one else should be his wife. But when he told his family of his resolve to marry her they were very angry, and made up all sorts of wicked stories about her. However, they might have spared themselves the trouble, as he knew it was only idle talk. "I have merely to remain firm," thought he, "and they will have to give in." It was such a good match for the girl that it never occurred to anyone that she would refuse the young man, but so it was. It would not be right, she felt, to make a quarrel in the house, and though in secret she wept bitterly, for a long while, nothing would make her change her mind. At length one night her mother appeared to her in a dream, and bade her marry the young man. So the next time he asked her--as he did nearly every day--to his surprise and joy she consented. The parents then saw they had better make the best of a bad business, and set about making the grand preparations suitable to the occasion. Of course the neighbours said a great many ill-natured things about the wooden helmet, but the bridegroom was too happy to care, and only laughed at them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1870'>When everything was ready for the feast, and the bride was dressed in the most beautiful embroidered dress to be found in Japan, the maids took hold of the helmet to lift it off her head, so that they might do her hair in the latest fashion. But the helmet would not come, and the harder they pulled, the faster it seemed to be, till the poor girl yelled with pain. Hearing her cries the bridegroom ran in and soothed her, and declared that she should be married in the helmet, as she could not be married without. Then the ceremonies began, and the bridal pair sat together, and the cup of wine was brought them, out of which they had to drink. And when they had drunk it all, and the cup was empty, a wonderful thing happened. The helmet suddenly burst with a loud noise, and fell in pieces on the ground; and as they all turned to look they found the floor covered with precious stones which had fallen out of it. But the guests were less astonished at the brilliancy of the diamonds than at the beauty of the bride, which was beyond anything they had ever seen or heard of. The night was passed in singing and dancing, and then the bride and bridegroom went to their own house, where they lived till they died, and had many children, who were famous throughout <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beauty;dancing;house;bridegroom;bride;goodness;child;singing' adjectives='many;own;famous' verbs='be;die;live;have;pass;go' valence='6.258' arousal='4.464' dominance='5.55933333333'>Japan</entity> for their goodness and beauty.</paragraph>

Everyone had almost given up hope, when one day a doctor arrived who was cleverer than the rest, and said that the only thing that would cure her was the liver of an ape. Now apes do not dwell under the sea, so a council of the wisest heads in the nation was called to consider the question how a liver could be obtained. At length it was decided that the turtle, whose prudence was well known, should swim to land and contrive to catch a living ape and bring him safely to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='turtle;living;prudence;length;kingdom;ape' adjectives='' verbs='swim;be;land;contrive;bring;know;decide;catch' valence='6.07933333333' arousal='3.83933333333' dominance='5.774'>the ocean</entity> kingdom.</paragraph>

It was some time before he caught sight of any monkeys, and he often grew tired with watching for them, so that one hot day he fell fast asleep, in spite of all his efforts to keep awake. By-and-by some apes, who had been peeping at him from the tops of the trees, where they had been carefully hidden from the turtle"s eyes, stole noiselessly down, and stood round staring at him, for they had never seen a turtle before, and did not know what to make of it. At last one young monkey, bolder than the rest, stooped down and stroked the shining shell that the strange new creature wore on its back. The movement, gentle though it was, woke the turtle. With one sweep he seized the monkey"s hand in his mouth, and held it tight, in spite of every effort to pull it away. The other apes, seeing that the turtle was not to be trifled with, ran off, leaving their young brother to his fate.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1878'>The monkey, seeing there was no help for it, did as he was bid; indeed he could not have resisted, as his hand was still in the turtle"s mouth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1879'>Delighted at having secured his prize, the turtle hastened back to the shore and plunged quickly into the water. He swam faster than he had ever done before, and soon reached the royal palace. Shouts of joy broke forth from the attendants when he was seen approaching, and some of them ran to tell the queen that the monkey was there, and that before long she would be as well as ever she was. In fact, so great was their relief that they gave the monkey such a kind welcome, and were so anxious to make him happy and comfortable, that he soon forgot all the fears that had beset him as to his fate, and was generally quite at his ease, though every now and then a fit of home-sickness would come over him, and he would hide himself in some dark corner till it had passed away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1880'>It was during one of these attacks of sadness that a jelly-fish happened to swim by. At that time jelly-fishes had shells. At the sight of the gay and lively monkey crouching under a tall rock, with his eyes closed and his head bent, the jelly-fish was filled with pity, and stopped, saying, "Ah, poor fellow, no wonder you weep; a few days more, and they will come and kill you and give your liver to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pity;head;eye;monkey;fellow;liver;sight;rock;weep;jelly-fish;wonder' adjectives='poor;tall;lively;gay;bent' verbs='be;crouch;give;stop;say;kill;close;come;eat;fill' valence='5.54413793103' arousal='4.16103448276' dominance='5.59137931034'>the queen</entity> to eat."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1881'>The monkey shrank back horrified at these words and asked the jelly-fish what crime he had committed that deserved death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1882'>"Oh, none at all," replied the jelly-fish, "but your liver is the only thing that will cure our queen, and how can we get at it without killing you? You had better submit to your fate, and make no noise about it, for though I pity you from my heart there is no way of helping you." Then he went away, leaving the ape cold with horror.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1883'>At first he felt as if his liver was already being taken from his body, but soon he began to wonder if there was no means of escaping this terrible death, and at length he invented a plan which he thought would do. For a few days he pretended to be gay and happy as before, but when the sun went in, and rain fell in torrents, he wept and howled from dawn to dark, till the turtle, who was his head keeper, heard him, and came to see what was the matter. Then the monkey told him that before he left home he had hung his liver out on a bush to dry, and if it was always going to rain like this it would become quite useless. And the rogue made such a fuss and moaning that he would have melted a heart of stone, and nothing would content him but that somebody should carry him back to land and let him fetch his liver again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1884'>The queen"s councillors were not the wisest of people, and they decided between them that the turtle should take the monkey back to his native land and allow him to get his liver off the bush, but desired the turtle not to lose sight of his charge for a single moment. The monkey knew this, but trusted to his power of beguiling the turtle when the time came, and mounted on his back with feelings of joy, which he was, however, careful to conceal. They set out, and in a few hours were wandering about the forest where the ape had first been caught, and when the monkey saw his family peering out from the tree tops, he swung himself up by the nearest branch, just managing to save his hind leg from being seized by the turtle. He told them all the dreadful things that had happened to him, and gave a war cry which brought the rest of the tribe from the neighbouring hills. At a word from him they rushed in a body to the unfortunate turtle, threw him on his back, and tore off the shield that covered his body. Then with mocking words they hunted him to the shore, and into the sea, which he was only too thankful to reach alive. Faint and exhausted he entered the queen"s palace for the cold of the water struck upon his naked body, and made him feel ill and miserable. But wretched though he was, he had to appear before the queen"s advisers and tell them all that had befallen him, and how he had suffered the monkey to escape. But, as sometimes happens, the turtle was allowed to go scot-free, and had his shell given back to him, and all the punishment fell on the poor jelly-fish, who was condemned by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='turtle;shell;punishment;jelly-fish' adjectives='poor;shieldless' verbs='be;allow;give;have;fall;go;happen;condemn' valence='5.431875' arousal='3.984375' dominance='5.221875'>the queen</entity> to go shieldless for ever after.</paragraph>

The minister did his best to keep the matter secret, but it leaked out for all that, and the end of it was that no one would enter his service.

No one took the slightest notice of any offer he might make, and the poor man was in despair, when one day, as he was standing at his house door, a youth known in the village as Clever Hans came up to him. "I am tired of living with a miser who will not give me enough to eat and drink," said he, "and I am ready to do all you want." "Very good, my son," replied the minister, "you shall have the chance of proving your courage this very night. To-morrow we will settle what your wages are to be."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1891'>Hans was quite content with this proposal, and went straight into the kitchen to begin his work, not knowing that his new master was quite as stingy as his old one.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1892'>About an hour before midnight, Hans entered the church and locked the door behind him, but what was his surprise when, in place of the darkness and silence he expected, he found the church brilliantly lighted, and a crowd of people sitting round a table playing cards. Hans felt no fear at this strange sight, or was prudent enough to hide it if he did, and, going up to the table, sat down amongst the players. One of them looked up and asked, "My friend, what are you doing here?" and Hans gazed at him for a moment, then laughed and answered, "Well, if anybody has a right to put that question, it is I!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1942'>THE YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD HAVE HIS EYES OPENED</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1943'>Once upon a time there lived a youth who was never happy unless he was prying into something that other people knew nothing about. After he had learned to understand the language of birds and beasts, he discovered accidentally that a great deal took place under cover of night which mortal eyes never saw. From that moment he felt he could not rest till these hidden secrets were laid bare to him, and he spent his whole time wandering from one wizard to another, begging them to open his eyes, but found none to help him. At length he reached an old magician called Mana, whose learning was greater than that of the rest, and who could tell him all he wanted to know. But when the old man had listened attentively to him, he said, warningly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1944'>"My son, do not follow after empty knowledge, which will not bring you happiness, but rather evil. Much is hidden from the eyes of men, because did they know everything their hearts would no longer be at peace. Knowledge kills joy, therefore think well what you are doing, or some day you will repent. But if you will not take my advice, then truly I can show you the secrets of the night. Only you will need more than a man"s courage to bear the sight."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1945'>He stopped and looked at the young man, who nodded his head, and then the wizard continued, "To-morrow night you must go to the place where, once in seven years, the serpent-king gives a great feast to his whole court. In front of him stands a golden bowl filled with goats" milk, and if you can manage to dip a piece of bread in this milk, and eat it before you are obliged to fly, you will understand all the secrets of the night that are hidden from other men. It is lucky for you that the serpent-king"s feast happens to fall this year, otherwise you would have had long to wait for it. But take care to be quick and bold, or it will be the worse for you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1946'>The young man thanked the wizard for his counsel, and went his way firmly resolved to carry out his purpose, even if he paid for it with his life; and when night came he set out for a wide, lonely moor, where the serpent-king held his feast. With sharpened eyes, he looked eagerly all round him, but could see nothing but a multitude of small hillocks, that lay motionless under the moonlight. He crouched behind a bush for some time, till he felt that midnight could not be far off, when suddenly there arose in the middle of the moor a brilliant glow, as if a star was shining over one of the hillocks. At the same moment all the hillocks began to writhe and to crawl, and from each one came hundreds of serpents and made straight for the glow, where they knew they should find their king. When they reached the hillock where he dwelt, which was higher and broader than the rest, and had a bright light hanging over the top, they coiled themselves up and waited. The whirr and confusion from all the serpent-houses were so great that the youth did not dare to advance one step, but remained where he was, watching intently all that went on; but at last he began to take courage, and moved on softly step by step.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1947'>What he saw was creepier than creepy, and surpassed all he had ever dreamt of. Thousands of snakes, big and little and of every colour, were gathered together in one great cluster round a huge serpent, whose body was as thick as a beam, and which had on its head a golden crown, from which the light sprang. Their hissings and darting tongues so terrified the young man that his heart sank, and he felt he should never have courage to push on to certain death, when suddenly he caught sight of the golden bowl in front of the serpent-king, and knew that if he lost this chance it would never come back. So, with his hair standing on end and his blood frozen in his veins, he crept forwards. Oh! what a noise and a whirr rose afresh among the serpents. Thousands of heads were reared, and tongues were stretched out to sting the intruder to death, but happily for him their bodies were so closely entwined one in the other that they could not disentangle themselves quickly. Like lightning he seized a bit of bread, dipped it in the bowl, and put it in his mouth, then dashed away as if fire was pursuing him. On he flew as if a whole army of foes were at his heels, and he seemed to hear the noise of their approach growing nearer and nearer. At length his breath failed him, and he threw himself almost senseless on the turf. While he lay there dreadful dreams haunted him. He thought that the serpent-king with the fiery crown had twined himself round him, and was crushing out his life. With a loud shriek he sprang up to do battle with his enemy, when he saw that it was rays of the sun which had wakened him. He rubbed his eyes and looked all round, but nothing could he see of the foes of the past night, and the moor where he had run into such danger must be at least a mile away. But it was no dream that he had run hard and far, or that he had drunk of the magic goats" milk. And when he felt his limbs, and found them whole, his joy was great that he had come through such perils with a sound skin.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1948'>After the fatigues and terrors of the night, he lay still till mid-day, but he made up his mind he would go that very evening into the forest to try what the goats" milk could really do for him, and if he would now be able to understand all that had been a mystery to him. And once in the forest his doubts were set at rest, for he saw what no mortal eyes had ever seen before. Beneath the trees were golden pavilions, with flags of silver all brightly lighted up. He was still wondering why the pavilions were there, when a noise was heard among the trees, as if the wind had suddenly got up, and on all sides beautiful maidens stepped from the trees into the bright light of the moon. These were the wood-nymphs, daughters of the earth-mother, who came every night to hold their dances, in the forest. The young man, watching from his hiding place, wished he had a hundred eyes in his head, for two were not nearly enough for the sight before him, the dances lasting till the first streaks of dawn. Then a silvery veil seemed to be drawn over the ladies, and they vanished from sight. But the young man remained where he was till the sun was high in the heavens, and then went home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1949'>He felt that day to be endless, and counted the minutes till night should come, and he might return to the forest. But when at last he got there he found neither pavilions nor nymphs, and though he went back many nights after he never saw them again. Still, he thought about them night and day, and ceased to care about anything else in the world, and was sick to the end of his life with longing for that beautiful vision. And that was <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='blindness;s;wizard;man' adjectives='good;highest' verbs='be;say;speak;have;learn' valence='5.84833333333' arousal='4.04916666667' dominance='5.43583333333'>the way</entity> he learned that the wizard had spoken truly when he said, "Blindness is man"s highest good."</paragraph>

And hastily assembling whatever soldiers happened to be at hand he set off at once to meet the enemy.

She had learnt that Iliane had fled from her prison in company with a merchant, and, as her son was absent, had come herself in pursuit. Striding over the blue waters, hopping from wave to wave, one foot reaching to heaven, and the other planted in the foam, she was close at their heels, breathing fire and flame, when they stepped on shore from the ship.

But the old woman seized hold of the branches and flung herself like a monkey from one to the others, and always she drew nearer--always, always--till their hair was singed by the flames of her mouth.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2217'>As soon as she caught sight of him, the princess went up and told him that Iliane had escaped, and that his mother, in her efforts to recapture her, had died of rage. At this news a blind fury took possession of the genius, and he rushed madly upon the princess, who awaited his onslaught with perfect calmness. As he came on, with his sabre lifted high in the air, Sunlight bounded right over his head, so that the sword fell harmless. And when in her turn <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;thigh;genius;blade;turn;s;knee' adjectives='' verbs='strike;pierce;sink;prepare' valence='5.31636363636' arousal='4.70181818182' dominance='5.45545454545'>the princess</entity> prepared to strike, the horse sank upon his knees, so that the blade pierced the genius"s thigh.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2218'>The fight was so fierce that it seemed as if the earth would give way under them, and for twenty miles round the beasts in the forests fled to their caves for shelter. At last, when her strength was almost gone, the genius lowered his sword for an instant. The princess saw her chance, and, with one swoop of her arm, severed her enemy"s head from his body. Still trembling from the long struggle, she turned away, and went to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='struggle;stud' adjectives='long' verbs='go;turn;tremble;feed;be' valence='5.40875' arousal='4.4125' dominance='5.27'>the meadow</entity> where the stud were feeding.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2219'>By the advice of Sunlight, she took care not to let them see her, and climbed a thick tree, where she could see and hear without being seen herself. Then he neighed, and the mares came galloping up, eager to see the new comer--all but one horse, who did not like strangers, and thought they were very well as they were. As Sunlight stood his ground, well pleased with the attention paid him, this sulky creature suddenly advanced to the charge, and bit so violently that had it not been for the nine buffalo skins Sunlight"s last moment would have come.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2222'>By this time the emperor, on hearing where she was, joined her in the yard, and at her request ordered the mares to be milked, so that both he and she might bathe in the milk and keep young for ever.

But she reached the altar in safety, and found the vase of holy water standing on it. This she thrust into her dress, and went back with the same care as she came. With a bound she was in the saddle, and seizing the reins bade Sunlight take her home as fast as his legs could carry him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2234'>The sound of the flying hoofs aroused the nun, who understood instantly that the precious treasure was stolen, and her shrieks were so loud and piercing that all the rest came flying to see what was the matter.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2254'>The eleven sons came into the world, strong and handsome boys; but when the twelfth was born, there was only half of him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2255'>By-and-by they all grew into men, and one day they told their father it was high time he found wives for them. "I have a brother," he answered, "who lives away in the East, and he has twelve daughters; go and marry them." So the twelve sons saddled their horses and rode for twelve days, till they met an old woman.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2256'>"Good greeting to you, young men!" said she, "we have waited long for you, your uncle and I. The girls have become women, and are sought, in marriage by many, but I knew you would come one day, and I have kept them for you. Follow me into my house."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2257'>And the twelve brothers followed her gladly, and their father"s brother stood at the door, and gave them meat and drink. But at night, when every one was asleep, Halfman crept softly to his brothers, and said to them, "Listen, all of you! This man is no uncle of ours, but an ogre."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2258'>"Nonsense; of course he is our uncle," answered they.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2259'>"Well, this very night you will see!" said Halfman. And he did not go to bed, but hid himself and watched.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2260'>Now in a little while he saw the wife of the ogre steal into the room on tiptoe and spread a red cloth over the brothers and then go and cover her daughters with a white cloth. After that she lay down and was soon snoring loudly. When Halfman was quite sure she was sound asleep, he took the red cloth from his brothers and put it on the girls, and laid their white cloth over his brothers. Next he drew their scarlet caps from their heads and exchanged them for the veils which the ogre"s daughters were wearing. This was hardly done when he heard steps coming along the floor, so he hid himself quickly in the folds of a curtain. There was only half of him!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2261'>The ogress came slowly and gently along, stretching out her hands before her, so that she might not fall against anything unawares, for she had only a tiny lantern slung at her waist, which did not give much light. And when she reached the place where the sisters were lying, she stooped down and held a corner of the cloth up to the lantern. Yes! it certainly was red! Still, to make sure that there was no mistake, she passed her hands lightly over their heads, and felt the caps that covered them. Then she was quite certain the brothers lay sleeping before her, and began to kill them one by one. And Halfman whispered to his brothers, "Get up and run for your lives, as the ogress is killing her daughters." The brothers needed no second bidding, and in a moment were out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='moment;brother;bidding' adjectives='' verbs='need;be' valence='5.8275' arousal='4.12125' dominance='5.5675'>the house</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2266'>"Oh, dear uncle, we were very nearly not coming at all!" replied they. "We fell in with an ogress who took us home and would have killed us if it had not been for Halfman. He knew what was in her mind and saved us, and here we are. Now give us each a daughter to wife, and let us return whence we came."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2268'>But the wife of Halfman was the prettiest of them all, and the other brothers were jealous and said to each other: "What, is he who is only half a man to get the best? Let us put him to death and give his wife to our eldest brother!" And they waited for a chance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2269'>After they had all ridden, in company with their brides, for some distance, they arrived at a brook, and one of them asked, "Now, who will go and fetch water from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;distance;company;brook;ridden;bride' adjectives='' verbs='ask;go;arrive;fetch;have' valence='5.97142857143' arousal='3.81785714286' dominance='5.75428571429'>the brook</entity>?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2271'>So Halfman got down and filled a skin with water, and they drew it up by a rope and drank. When they had done drinking, Halfman, who was standing in the middle of the stream, called out: "Throw me the rope and draw me up, for I cannot get out alone." And the brothers threw him a rope to draw him up the steep bank; but when he was half-way up they cut the rope, and he fell back into the stream. Then the brothers rode away as fast as they could, with his bride.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2272'>Halfman sank down under the water from the force of the fall, but before he touched the bottom a fish came and said to him, "Fear nothing, Halfman; I will help you."

Then she returned to Halfman and told him to go and claim his bride. He jumped up hastily from his seat, and took the road to his father"s house.

For a long time the king refused to give him leave; but at last, wearied out, he granted permission, and ordered his treasurer to produce a large sum of money for the prince"s expenses.

When there was absolutely nothing left at the bottom of the bag, the stranger proposed that they should have just one more game, and that if the prince won he should have the money restored to him, but in case he lost, should remain in the inn for three years, and besides that should be his servant for another three. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='water;term;room;stranger;bread' adjectives='' verbs='take;play;agree;furnish;lose' valence='5.68071428571' arousal='4.06' dominance='5.51571428571'>The prince</entity> agreed to those terms, played, and lost; so the stranger took rooms for him, and furnished him with bread and water every day for three years.</paragraph>

Before he had gone very far he met a woman carrying a child, which was crying from hunger. The prince took it from her, and fed it with his last crust of bread and last drop of water, and then gave it back to its mother. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;thank' valence='6.92333333333' arousal='3.85333333333' dominance='6.56666666667'>The woman</entity> thanked him gratefully, and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2374'>The young man did as he was told, and everything happened as the woman had said.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2384'>Wondering at this strange order, the prince picked up his knife and severed the dove"s head from her body at one stroke.

Do not forget to take a good club, to help you in dealing with such a crew."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2388'>So the prince mounted the colt, and gave him such a beating that when he came to the palace to announce that the animal was now so meek that it could be ridden by the smallest child, he found the king so bruised that he had to be wrapped in cloths dipped in vinegar, the mother was too stiff to move, and several of the daughters" ribs were broken. The youngest, however, was quite unharmed.

But the prince was foolish enough to choose the fattest: and when they had started and the princess saw what he had done, she was very sorry, for though this horse ran like the wind, the other flashed like thought.

As the king rode up, the gardener looked up from the tree which he was trimming and asked if anything was the matter. "Have you seen a young man and a girl go by?" said the king, and the gardener shook his head and replied that no one had passed that way since he had been working there.

Her mother recognised them all, and, pulling up, asked her daughter if she did not repent and would not like to come home again. The eel wagged "No" with her tail, and the queen told her husband to put a drop of water from the pool into a bottle, because it was only by that means that she could seize hold of her daughter. The king did as he was bid, and was just in the act of drawing the bottle out of the water after he had filled it, when the turtle knocked against and spilt it all. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='turtle;time' adjectives='quick' verbs='be;fill' valence='5.72625' arousal='3.85' dominance='5.565'>The king</entity> then filled it a second time, but again the turtle was too quick for him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2409'>Long, long ago there was born to a Roman knight and his wife Maja a little boy called Virgilius.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2410'>Virgilius was fond of books, and pored over them all day long. But one afternoon, when the boys were given a holiday, he took a long walk, and found himself in a place where he had never been before. In front of him was a cave, and, as no boy ever sees a cave without entering it, he went in. The cave was so deep that it seemed to Virgilius as if it must run far into the heart of the mountain, and he thought he would like to see if it came out anywhere on the other side. For some time he walked on in pitch darkness, but he went steadily on, and by-and-by a glimmer of light shot across the floor, and he heard a voice calling, "Virgilius! <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='' valence='5.0' arousal='5.0' dominance='5.0'>Virgilius</entity>!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2411'>"Who calls?" he asked, stopping and looking round.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2416'>"I am an evil spirit," said the voice, "shut up here till Doomsday, unless a man sets me free. If you will let me out I will give you some magic books, which will make you wiser than any other man."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2417'>Now Virgilius loved wisdom, and was tempted by these promises, but again his prudence came to his aid, and he demanded that the books should be handed over to him first, and that he should be told how to use them. The evil spirit, unable to help itself, did as Virgilius bade him, and then the bolt was drawn back. Underneath was a small hole, and out of this the evil spirit gradually wriggled himself; but it took some time, for when at last he stood upon the ground he proved to be about three times as large as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='underneath;coal;time;hole;spirit;ground' adjectives='small;large;last;evil;black' verbs='wriggle;be;prove;take;stand' valence='5.40055555556' arousal='3.74277777778' dominance='5.14277777778'>Virgilius</entity> himself, and coal black besides.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2423'>Though sorry to leave Toledo, where he was much thought of as showing promise of great learning, Virgilius would willingly have set out at once, but there were many things he had first to see to. So he entrusted to the messenger four pack-horses laden with precious things, and a white palfrey on which she was to ride out every day. Then he set about his own preparations, and, followed by a large train of scholars, he at length started for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='preparation;length;train;scholar' adjectives='large;absent;own' verbs='follow;be;set;have;start' valence='5.56857142857' arousal='3.92285714286' dominance='5.51928571429'>Rome</entity>, from which he had been absent twelve years.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2425'>Soon after this had happened the season of tax-gathering came round, and everyone who owned land was bound to present himself before the emperor. Like the rest, Virgilius went to court, and demanded justice from the emperor against the men who had robbed him. But as these were kinsmen to the emperor he gained nothing, as the emperor told him he would think over the matter for the next four years, and then give judgment. This reply naturally did not satisfy <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='house;reply;harvest;heel;home' adjectives='own;various' verbs='satisfy;do;gather;turn;go;store' valence='6.01769230769' arousal='3.88923076923' dominance='5.93769230769'>Virgilius</entity>, and, turning on his heel, he went back to his own home, and, gathering in his harvest, he stored it up in his various houses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2426'>When the enemies of Virgilius heard of this, they assembled together and laid siege to his castle. But Virgilius was a match for them. Coming forth from the castle so as to meet them face to face, he cast a spell over them of such power that they could not move, and then bade them defiance. After which he lifted the spell, and the invading army slunk back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='spell;emperor;army' adjectives='' verbs='slink;say;lift;have;report;invade' valence='5.05' arousal='4.20555555556' dominance='5.60666666667'>Rome</entity>, and reported what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='spell;emperor;army' adjectives='' verbs='slink;say;lift;have;report;invade' valence='5.05' arousal='4.20555555556' dominance='5.60666666667'>Virgilius</entity> had said to the emperor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2427'>Now the emperor was accustomed to have his lightest word obeyed, almost before it was uttered, and he hardly knew how to believe his ears. But he got together another army, and marched straight off to the castle. But directly they took up their position Virgilius girded them about with a great river, so that they could neither move hand nor foot, then, hailing the emperor, he offered him peace, and asked for his friendship. The emperor, however, was too angry to listen to anything, so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='anything;presence;host;hand;patience;follower;foot;emperor' adjectives='angry;own' verbs='be;exhaust;feast;stir;starve;listen' valence='5.318' arousal='3.924' dominance='5.53866666667'>Virgilius</entity>, whose patience was exhausted, feasted his own followers in the presence of the starving host, who could not stir hand or foot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2428'>Things seemed getting desperate, when a magician arrived in the camp and offered to sell his services to the emperor. His proposals were gladly accepted, and in a moment the whole of the garrison sank down as if they were dead, and Virgilius himself had much ado to keep awake. He did not know how to fight the magician, but with a great effort struggled to open his Black Book, which told him what spells to use. In an instant all his foes seemed turned to stone, and where each man was there he stayed. Some were half way up the ladders, some had one foot over the wall, but wherever they might chance to be there every man remained, even the emperor and his sorcerer. All day they stayed there like flies upon the wall, but during the night Virgilius stole softly to the emperor, and offered him his freedom, as long as he would do him justice. The emperor, who by this time was thoroughly frightened, said he would agree to anything Virgilius desired. So Virgilius took off his spells, and, after feasting the army and bestowing on every man a gift, bade them return to Rome. And more than that, he built a square tower for the emperor, and in each corner all that was said in that quarter of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='quarter;centre;whisper;ear;corner;tower;emperor' adjectives='square;more' verbs='be;reach;say;hear;build;stand' valence='5.69588235294' arousal='3.81764705882' dominance='5.76882352941'>the city</entity> might be heard, while if you stood in the centre every whisper throughout <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='quarter;centre;whisper;ear;corner;tower;emperor' adjectives='square;more' verbs='be;reach;say;hear;build;stand' valence='5.69588235294' arousal='3.81764705882' dominance='5.76882352941'>Rome</entity> would reach your ears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2429'>Having settled his affairs with the emperor and his enemies, Virgilius had time to think of other things, and his first act was to fall in love! The lady"s name was Febilla, and her family was noble, and her face fairer than any in Rome, but she only mocked Virgilius, and was always playing tricks upon him. To this end, she bade him one day come to visit her in the tower where she lived, promising to let down a basket to draw him up as far as the roof. Virgilius was enchanted at this quite unexpected favour, and stepped with glee into the basket. It was drawn up very slowly, and by-and-by came altogether to a standstill, while from above rang the voice of Febilla crying, "Rogue of a sorcerer, there shalt thou hang!" And there he hung over the market-place, which was soon thronged with people, who made fun of him till he was mad with rage. At last the emperor, hearing of his plight, commanded <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;plight;emperor;vengeance;hearing' adjectives='last' verbs='release;go;vow;command' valence='5.33125' arousal='4.4225' dominance='5.73'>Febilla</entity> to release him, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;plight;emperor;vengeance;hearing' adjectives='last' verbs='release;go;vow;command' valence='5.33125' arousal='4.4225' dominance='5.73'>Virgilius</entity> went home vowing vengeance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2430'>The next morning every fire in Rome went out, and as there were no matches in those days this was a very serious matter. The emperor, guessing that this was the work of Virgilius, besought him to break the spell. Then Virgilius ordered a scaffold to be erected in the market-place, and Febilla to be brought clothed in a single white garment. And further, he bade every one to snatch fire from the maiden, and to suffer no neighbour to kindle it. And when the maiden appeared, clad in her white smock, flames of fire curled about her, and the Romans brought some torches, and some straw, and some shavings, and fires were kindled in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='smock;maiden;fire;torch;straw;flame;shaving' adjectives='white' verbs='be;appear;bring;kindle;curl;clothe' valence='5.42923076923' arousal='4.20076923077' dominance='5.31615384615'>Rome</entity> again.</paragraph>

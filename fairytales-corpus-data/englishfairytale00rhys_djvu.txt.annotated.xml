	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='16'>The tales in this book have been chosen from many  sources, which represent the old haunts of people, fairy-  tale people, like Mother Hubba-rd and Simple Simon, who  figure in rhyme or legend. /,,/</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='17'>Some of these\" talcs have been forgotten, and some  have been lost or long-buried ; and there are several  that may seem hew to you who read them here to-day.  Such a story is that of the elfin Green Knight, which is  a case of a delightful old fairy-tale that grew into as  delightful a romance. A romance indeed is little else than  a fairy-tale for older folk. The romancers ** swapped "  (as schoolboys say) their good things, and in this way we  get a story like that of King Arthur and the Giant of St.  Michael\"s Mount, which comes from the noble old roman-  cer. Sir Thomas Malory. For a fairy-tale, like a cat,  has nine lives ; it can pass into many queer shapes, and  yet not die. You may cut off its head, or drown it in  sentiment or sea-water, or tie a moral to its tail ; but  it will still survive, and be found sitting safe by the fire  some winter night.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>u"In the reign of King Arthur, there lived in the county of  Cornwall, near the Land"s End of England, a wealthy  farmer who had one only son called Jack. He was brisk  and of a ready lively wit, so that whatever he could not  perform by force and strength, he did by his quick wit and  cleverness. Never was any person heard of that could  worst him, and he very often even baffled wise men by his  sharp and ready invention. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>u"In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a  huge and monstrous giant of eighteen feet in height, and  about three yards in girth, of a fierce and grim face, the  terror of all the towns and villages near. He lived in a  cave in the midst of the mount, and would not suffer any  one else to live near him. His food was other men"s cattle,  which often became his prey, for whensoever he wanted  food he would wade over to the mainland, where he would  furnish himself with whatever came in his way. The  good folk, at his approach, forsook their homes, while he "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='102'>seized on their cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-  dozen oxen on his back at a time ; and as for their sheep  and hogs, he would tie them round his waist like a bunch  of bandeliers. This course he had followed for many  years, so that all <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;robbery' adjectives='many;poor' verbs='have;follow;have;become'>Cornwall</entity> had become poor through his  robberies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>u"One day Jack, happening to be present at the town hall  when the magistrates were sitting in council about the  giant, asked what reward would be given to the person  who destroyed him. The giant"s treasure, they said, was  the reward. Quoth Jack, ** Then let me undertake it."* "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='104'>So he took a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over  to the Mount in the beginning of a dark winter\"s evening,  when he fell to work, and before morning had dug a pit  twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as broad, covering it over  with long sticks and straw. Then strewing a little mould  upon it, it appeared like plain ground. This done, Jack  placed himself on the contrary side of the pit, farthest from  the giant\"s lodging, and, just at the break of day, he put  the horn to his mouth, and blew, Tantivy, Tantivy. The  unexpected noise aroused the giant, who rushed from his  cave, crying : " You bold villain, are you come here to  disturb my rest ^ You shall pay dearly for this. Satis-  faction I will have, and this it shall be, I will take you whole  and broil you for breakfast," which he had no sooner  uttered, than tumbling into the pit, he made the very  foundations of the Mount to shake. \"* Oh, giant," quoth  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='\;\;faith;lob;s;pound;word;breakfast;diet;giant;while' adjectives='giant;wicked;<;other;poor;<' verbs='be;<;be;get;plague;do;think;broil;serve;have;tease'>Jack</entity>, \"\" where are you now &lt; Oh faith, you are gotten  now into Lob\"s Pound, where I will surely plague you for  your wicked words : what do you think now of broiling  me for your breakfast &lt; Will no other diet serve you but  poor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='\;\;faith;lob;s;pound;word;breakfast;diet;giant;while' adjectives='giant;wicked;<;other;poor;<' verbs='be;<;be;get;plague;do;think;broil;serve;have;tease'>Jack</entity> &lt; " Thus having teased the giant for a while,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='107'>he gave him a most weighty knock with his pickaxe on the  very crown of his head, and killed him on the spot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='108'>This done, Jack filled up the pit with earth, and went  to search the cave, which he found contained much  treasure. When the magistrates heard of this, they said  he should henceforth be called <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='magistrate;sword;belt;word;letter;gold' adjectives='embroidered' verbs='hear;say;be;call;give;be;write'>Jack</entity> the Giant-killer, and  gave him a sword and an embroidered belt, on which were  written these words in letters of gold</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='110'>u"The news of Jack"s victory soon spread over all the West  of England, so that another giant, named Blunderbore,  hearing of it, vowed to be revenged on the little hero, if  ever it was his fortune to light on him. This giant was the  lord of an enchanted castle standing in the midst of a lone-  some wood. Now Jack, about four months afterwards,  walking near this wood in his journey to Wales, being  weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain and fell fast  asleep. While he was enjoying his repose, the giant,  coming for water, there found him, and knew him to be  the far-famed Jack by the lines written on the belt. With-  out ado, he took Jack on his shoulders and carried him  towards his enchanted castle. Now, as they passed  through a thicket, the rustling of the boughs awakened  Jack, who was strangely surprised to find himself in the  clutches of the giant. His terror was not yet begun, for  on entering the castle, he saw the ground strewed with  human bones, the giant telling him his own would ere long  be there also. After this the giant locked poor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chamber;living;wood' adjectives='giant;poor;immense;giant;same' verbs='lock;leave;go;fetch;help;put'>Jack</entity> in an  immense chamber, leaving him there while he went to fetch  another giant living in the same wood to help him to put "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='113'>an end to Jack. While he was gone, dreadful shrieks and  cries affrighted <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shriek;voice;time' adjectives='dreadful;affrighted;many' verbs='be;go;cry;say'>Jack</entity>, especially a voice which said many  times</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>\"* Do what you can to get away,  Or you\"ll become the giant\"s prey ;  He\"s gone to fetch his brother, who  Will kill, likewise devour you too."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='115'>This dreadful noise had almost distracted Jack, who,  going to the window, beheld afar off the two giants coming  towards the castle. \"* Now," quoth Jack to himself, ** my  death or my escape is at hand." Now, there were strong  cords in a corner of the room in which Jack was, and two  of these he took, and made a strong noose at the end ; and  while the giants were unlocking the iron gate of the castle  he threw the ropes over each of their heads. Then draw-  ing the other ends across a beam, and pulling with all his  might, he throttled them. Then, seeing they were black  in the face, and sliding down the rope, he came to their  heads, when they could not defend themselves, and draw-  ing his sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant\"s  keys, and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies  tied by the hair of their heads, almost starved to death.  \"* Sweet ladies," quoth Jack, ** I have killed this monster  and his brutish brother, and so set you free." This said,  he gave them the keys, and so went on his journey to  Wales. Having but little money, Jack found it well to  make the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could,  but losing his road, he was benighted, and could not get a  place to rest in until, coming into a narrow valley, he found  a large house, and by reason of his present needs took  courage to knock at the gate. But what was his surprise</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='118'>when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads ;  yet he did not appear so fiery as the others were, for he was  a Welsh giant, and what he did was by private and secret  malice under the false show of friendship. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='state;giant;bedroom;dead;host' adjectives='' verbs='have;tell;be;show;hear;mutter'>Jack</entity>, having  told his state to the giant, was shown into a bedroom, where,  in the dead of night, he heard his host muttering</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='119'>\"* Though here you lodge with me this night.  You shall not see the morning light :  My club shall dash your brains outright ! "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='120'>*\" Say\"st thou so $* " quoth Jack ; ** that is like one of your  Welsh tricks, yet I hope to be cunning enough for you/*  Then, getting out of bed, he laid a billet of wood in the  bed in his stead, and hid himself in a corner of the room.  At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who  struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club,  thinking he had broken every bone in Jack^s skin. The  next morning Jack, laughing in his sleeve, gave him hearty  thanks for his night\"s lodging. \"* How have you rested i *\"  quoth the giant ; \"* did you not feel anything in the night ^ *\"  ** No,** quoth Jack, *\" nothing but a rat, which gave me two  or three slaps with her tail.*\" With that, greatly wondering,  the giant led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl con-  taining four gallons of hasty pudding. Being loath to let  the giant think it too much for him. Jack put a large leather  bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could convey  the pudding into it without its being seen. Then, telling  the giant he would show him a trick, taking a knife. Jack  ripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty pudding.  Whereupon, saying, ** Odds splutters, hur can do that  trick hurself,** the monster took the knife, and ripping  open his body, fell down dead.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='123'>Now, it fell in these days that King Arthur\"s only son  begged his father to give him a large sum of money, in  order that he might go and seek his fortune in the country  of Wales, where lived a beautiful lady possessed with seven  evil spirits* The king did his best to persuade his son  from it, but in vain ; so at last granted the request, and the  prince set out with two horses, one loaded with money, the  other for himself to ride upon. Now, after several days\"  travel, he came to a market-town in Wales, where he  beheld a vast crowd of people gathered together. The  prince asked the reason of it, and was told that they had  arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which  the dead man owed when he died. The prince replied  that it was a pity creditors should be so cruel, and said,  ** Go bury the dead, and let his creditors come to my  lodging, and there their debts shall be paid." So they  came, but in such great numbers that before night he had  almost left himself moneyless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='124'>Now Jack the Giant-killer, coming that way, was so  taken with the generosity of the prince, that he wished to be  his servant. This being agreed upon, the next morning  they set forward on their journey together, when, as they  were riding out of the town, an old woman called after the  prince, saying, ** He has owed me twopence these seven  years ; pray pay me as well as the rest." Putting his hand  to his pocket, the prince gave the woman all he had left,  so that after their day\"s refreshment, which cost what small  spell Jack had by him, they were without a penny between  them. When the sun began to grow low, the king\"s son  said, ** <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sun;king;s;son;money;master;ll;uncle;mile' adjectives='low' verbs='begin;grow;say;have;lodge;reply;\;do;have;live'>Jack</entity>, since we have no money, where can we lodge  this night i " But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sun;king;s;son;money;master;ll;uncle;mile' adjectives='low' verbs='begin;grow;say;have;lodge;reply;\;do;have;live'>Jack</entity> replied, *\" Master, we\"ll do well  enough, for I have an uncle lives within two miles of this</paragraph>

""  ** It is no matter for that,\"\" quoth Jack ; \"\" I myself will go  before and prepare the way for you ; therefore tarry and  wait till I return." Jack then rode away full speed, and  coming to the gate of the castle, he knocked so loud that  he made the hills around to echo. The giant roared out  at this Hke thunder, ** Who\"s there i " He was answered,  *\" None but your poor Cousin Jack." Quoth he, *\" What  news with my poor Cousin Jack i " He replied, " Dear  Uncle, heavy news, God wot ! " ** Prithee," quoth the  giant, ** what heavy news can come to me ^ I am a giant  with three heads, and besides thou knowest I can fight  five hundred men in armour, and make them fly like chaff  before the wind." \"* Oh, but," quoth Jack, ** here\"s the  king\"s son a-coming with a thousand men in armour to  kill you and destroy all that you have ! " ** Oh, Cousin  Jack," said the giant, \"\" this is heavy news indeed ! I will  immediately run and hide myself, and thou shalt lock, bolt,  and bar me in, and keep the keys until the prince is gone."  Having secured the giant. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='master;vault;ground' adjectives='merry;poor;giant;lay' verbs='fetch;make;tremble'>Jack</entity> fetched his master, when  they made themselves heartily merry whilst the poor giant  lay trembling in a vault under the ground.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='130'>Early in the morning Jack furnished his master with a  fresh supply of gold and silver, and then sent him three  miles forward on his journey, at which time the prince was  pretty well out of the smell of the giant.

The coat will keep you invisible, the cap will furnish  you with knowledge, the sword cuts asunder whatever you  strike, and the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness. These  may be useful to you, therefore take them with all my  heart." Taking them, Jack thanked his uncle, and then  having overtaken his master, they quickly arrived at the  house of the lady the prince sought, who, finding the  prince to be a suitor, prepared a splendid banquet for him.  After the feasting was done, she wiped his mouth with a  handkerchief, saying, ** You must show me that hand-  kerchief to-morrow morning, or else you will lose your  head." With that she put it in her bosom. The prince  went to bed in great sorrow, but Jack\"s cap of knowledge  taught him how it was to be got. In the middle of the  night she called upon her familiar spirit to carry her to  Lucifer. But Jack put on his coat of darkness and his shoes  of swiftness, and was there as soon as she. When she  entered the place of the evil one, she gave the handkerchief  to old Lucifer, who laid it upon a shelf, whence Jack took  it and brought it to his master, who showed it to the lady  the next day, and so saved his life. On that day, she  saluted the prince, telling him he must show her the lips  to-morrow morning that she kissed last night, or lose his  head. *\" Ah," he replied, " if you kiss none but mine, I  will." " That is neither here nor there," said she ; ** if  you do not, death\"s your portion ! " At midnight she  went as before, and was angry with old Lucifer for letting  the handkerchief go.

At this the courteous knight  and his fair lady, after returning Jack their hearty thanks,  invited him home, there to refresh his strength after the  batde, and receive some ample reward for his good services.

His goggle eyes were like flames of fire, his face  grim and ugly, and his cheeks like a couple of large flitches  of bacon, while the bristles of his beard resembled rods of  iron wire, and the locks that hung down upon his brawny  shoulders were like curled snakes or hissing adders.

While she slept,  she had a strange dream. She dreamt that two fair  knights came to her side, and bade her come quickly with  them to speak to their lord and king. But she answered  them right boldly, that she neither dared nor cared to go  with them. So the two knights went away ; but very  quickly they returned, bringing their king with them, and  a thousand knights in his train, and many beauteous  ladies drest in pure white, riding on snow-white steeds.  The king had a crown on his head, not of silver or red-gold,  but all of precious stones that shone like the sun. By his  side was led a lady"s white palfrey that seemed to be pre-  pared for some rider, for its saddle was empty. He com-  manded that Heurodis should be placed upon this white  steed, and thereupon the King of Faerie and his train of  knights and white dames, and Heurodis beside him, rode  off through a fair country with many flowery meads, fields,  forests, and pleasant waters, where stood castles and towers  amid the green trees.

Other times he saw these  faerie knights and ladies dance, dressed Hke guisers, with  tabors beating and joyous trumpets blowing. And one day  Orfeo saw sixty lovely ladies ride out to the riverside for  falconry, each with her falcon on her bare hand, and in the  very midst of them (oh wonder !) rode his lost queen,  Heurodis. He determined at once to follow them ; and  after flying their falcons they return through the forest at  evening to a wild rocky place, where they ride into the rock  through a rude cleft, overhung with brambles. They ride  in, a league and more, till they come to the fairest country  ever seen, where it is high midsummer and broad sunhght.  In its midst stands a palace of an hundred towers, with  walls of crystal, and windows coped and arched with gold.  All that land was light, because when the night should come,  the precious stones in the palace walls gave out a Hght as  bright as noonday. Into this palace hall Orfeo entered, in  the train of the ladies, and saw there the King of Faerie on  his throne. The king was enraged at first when he saw  the strange man enter with his harp. But Orfeo offers to  play upon it, and Heurodis, when she hears, is filled with  longing, while the Faerie King is so enchanted that he  promises to Orfeo any gift he likes to ask out of all the  riches of the faerie regions.

And she had heard  the middle voice of the Middle Bear, but it was only as if  she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when  she heard the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and  so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started ;  and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed,  she tumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window.  Now the window was open, because the Bears, like good,  tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bed-chamber  window when they got up in the morning. Out the little  old Woman jumped ; and whether she broke her neck in  the fall ; or ran into the wood and was lost there ; or  found her way out of the wood, and was taken up by the  constable and sent to the House of Correction for a vagrant  as she was, I cannot tell. But the Three Bears never saw  anything more of her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='414'>Long, long ago,  I cannot say how long,  the young heir  of Lambton Castle led a careless, profane life, regardless  of God and man. All his Saturday nights he spent in  drinking, and all his Sunday mornings in fishing. One  Sunday he had cast his line into the Water of Wear many  times without a bite ; and at last in a rage he let loose his  tongue in curses loud and deep, to the great scandal of the  servants and country-folk as they passed by to the old  chapel at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='line;water;time;bite;rage;tongue;curse;scandal;servant;country-folk;chapel;ruin' adjectives='many;last;loose;loud;deep;great;old' verbs='have;cast;wear;let;pass;be'>Brugeford</entity>, which was not in ruins then.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='419'>his horror and dismay on finding that instead of a fish he  had only caught a loathly worm of most evil appearance !  He hastily tore the foul thing from his hook and flung it  into a well close by, which is still known by the name of the  Worm Well</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='420'>The young heir had scarcely thrown his line again into  the stream when a stranger of venerable appearance,  passing by, asked him what sport he had met with</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='421'>u"He replied : "" Why, truly, I think I have caught the  evil one himself. Look in and judge/" "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='422'>The stranger looked, and remarked that he had never  seen the like of it before ; that it resembled an eft, only it  had nine holes on each side of its mouth ; and, finally, that  he thought it boded no good.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='423'>The worm remained there unheeded in the well till it  outgrew so confined a dwelling-place. It then emerged,  and betook itself by day to the river, where it lay coiled  round a rock in the middle of the stream, and by night to  a neighbouring hill, round whose base it would twine itself,  while it continued to grow so fast that it soon could encircle  the hill three times. This eminence is still called the  Worm Hill. It is oval in shape, on the north side of the  Wear, and about a mile and a half from old Lambton  Hall.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>u"The Lambton Worm now became the terror of the whole  country side. It sucked the cows" milk, worried the cattle,  devoured the lambs, and committed every sort of depreda-  tion on the helpless peasantry. Having laid waste the  district on the north side of the river, it crossed the stream  and approached Lambton Hall, where the old lord was  living alone and desolate. His son had repented of his  evil life, and had gone to the wars in a distant country. "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='427'>Some people say he had gone as a crusader to the Holy  Land.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='428'>u"On hearing of the dreaded Worm"s approach, the terrified  household assembled in council. Much was said, but to  little purpose, till the steward, a man of age and experience,  advised that the large trough which stood in the courtyard  should immediately be filled with milk. This was done  without delay ; the monster approached, drank the milk,,  and without doing further harm, returned across the  Wear to wrap his giant form around his favourite hilL  The next day he was seen recrossing the river ; the trough  was hastily filled again, and with the same results. It was.  found that the milk of "* nine kye "" was needed to fill the  trough ; and if this quantity was not placed there every  day, regularly and in full measure, the Worm would break,  out into a violent rage, lashing its tail round the trees in the  park, and tearing them up by the roots. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='429'>The Lambton Worm was now, in fact, the terror of the  whole country. Many a knight had come out to fight with  it, but all to no purpose ; for it possessed the marvellous  power of reuniting itself after being cut asunder, and thus  was more than a match for all the knighthood of the North.  So after many a vain conflict, and the loss of many a brave  man, the creature was left in possession of its favourite  hill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='430'>After seven long years, however, the heir of Lambton  returned home, to find the broad lands of his ancestors  waste and desolate, his people terror-stricken or in hiding,  his father sinking into the grave overwhelmed with care  and anxiety.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='434'>At first the Wise-woman of Chester-le-Street did nothing  but upbraid him for having brought this scourge upon his  house and neighbourhood ; but when she saw that he was  indeed penitent, and eager at any cost to remove the evil  he had caused, she bade him get his best suit of mail  studded thickly with spear-heads ; to put it on, and thus  armed to take his stand on the rock in the middle of the  river Wear. There he must meet the Worm face to face,  trusting the issue to Providence and his good sword. But  she charged him before going to the encounter to take a  vow, that if successful, he would slay the first living thing  that met him on his way homewards. Should he fail to  fulfil this vow, she warned him that for nine generations no  lord of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='vow;generation;lord;bed' adjectives='' verbs='fail;fulfil;warn;die'>Lambton</entity> would die in his bed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='435'>The heir, now a belted knight, made the vow in Bruge-  ford Chapel. He studded his armour back and breast-  plate, greaves and armlets, with the sharpest spear-heads,  and unsheathing his trusty sword took his stand on the  rock in the middle of the Wear. At the accustomed hour  the Worm uncoiled its ** snaky twine," and wound its way  towards the hall, crossing the river close by the rock on  which the knight was standing eager for the combat. He  struck a violent blow upon the monster\"s head as it passed,  on which the creature turned on him, and writhing and  lashing the water in its rage, flung its tail round him, as if to  strangle him in its coils.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='436'>But the closer the Worm wrapped him in its folds the  more deadly were its self-inflicted wounds, till at last the  river ran crimson with its blood. As its strength diminished  the knight redoubled his strokes, and he was able at last</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='440'>u"During this long and terrible combat in the river, the  household of Lambton had shut themselves within-doors  to pray for their young lord, he having promised that when  it was over he would, if conqueror, blow a blast on his  bugle. This would assure his father of his safety, and  warn them to let loose a favourite hound which they had  destined as the victim, according to the Wise-woman"s  word and the young lord"s vow. When, however, the  bugle-notes were heard within the hall, the old lord of  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bugle-note;hall;lord;everything;son;s;safety;rush;door' adjectives='old' verbs='be;hear;forget;ing;run;meet;embrace'>Lambton</entity> forgot everything but his son"s safety, and rush-  ing out of doors, ran to meet and embrace him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='444'>Once upon a time a knight was riding in the country  beyond Gloucester, and came to a forest abounding in  boars, stags, and every kind of wild beast. Now in a  grovy lawn of this forest there was a little mount, rising  in a point to the height of a man, on which knights and  other hunters were used to ascend when fatigued with  heat and thirst, to seek some relief. The nature of the  place  for it is a fairy place  is such that whoever ascends  the mount must leave his companions, and go quite alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='445'>u"As the knight rode in the wood, and came nigh this fairy-  knoll, he met with a wood-cutter and questioned him about  it. He must go thither alone, the wood-cutter told him,  and say, as if speaking to some other person :  ** I thirst ! "" "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='446'>Immediately there would appear a cup-bearer in a rich  crimson dress, with a shining face, bearing in his stretched-  out hand a large horn, adorned with gold and gems, such  as was the custom among the most ancient English. The  cup was full of nectar, of an unknown but most delicious  flavour, and when it was drunk, all heat and weariness fled  from those who drank of it, so that they became ready to  toil anew, instead of being tired from having toiled.  Moreover, when the nectar was drunk, the cup-bearer  offered a towel to the drinker, to wipe his mouth with, and  then having done this, he waited neither for a silver  penny for his services, nor for any question to be asked.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='453'>Instantly there appeared, as the wood-cutter had fore-  told, a cup-bearer in a crimson dress, bearing in his hand  a drinking-horn. The horn was richly beset with precious  gems ; and the knight was filled with envy at sight of it.  No sooner had he sei2;ed upon it, and tasted of its delicious  nectar, than he determined to make off with the horn. So,  having gotten the horn, and drunk of it every drop, instead  of returning it to the cup-bearer, as in good manners he  should have done, he stepped down from the knoll, and  rudely made off with it in his hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='454'>But learn what fate overtook this knight. The good  Earl of Gloucester, standing on the fairy-knoll, when he  heard that the wicked knight had destroyed the kind  custom of the horn, attacked the robber in his stronghold,  and forthright slew him, and carried off the horn. But  alas ! the earl did not return it to the fairy-cupbearer, but  gave it to his master and lord. King Henry the Elder.  Since then you may stand all day at the fairy-knoll, and  many times cry ** I thirst ! " but you may not taste of the  Fairy Horn.</paragraph>

Rich  gifts were given and many lords and ladies took their seats  at the table, where Queen Guenever sat at the king"s side,  and a lady fairer of form might no one say he had ever  before seen. But King Arthur would not eat nor would he  long sit until he should have witnessed some wondrous  adventure. The first course was served with a blowing  of trumpets, and before each two guests were set twelve  dishes, and bright wine, for there was no want of anything.  Scarcely had the first course commenced, when there  rushed in at the hall-door a knight,  the tallest on earth he  must have been. His back and breast were broad, but  his waist was small. He was clothed entirely in green, and  his spurs were of bright gold ; his saddle was embroidered  with birds and flies, and the steed that he rode upon was  green. Gaily was the knight attired ; his great beard, like  a green bush, hung on his breast. His horse"s mane was  decked with golden threads, and its tail bound with a green  band ; such a horse and such a knight were never before  seen. It seemed that no man might endure the Green  Knight"s blows, but he carried neither spear nor shield. "</paragraph>

King Arthur, who was never afraid, saluted  the Green Knight and bade him welcome. The Green  Knight said that he would not tarry ; he was seeking the  most valiant, that he might prove him.

He is dubbed in a doublet of Tarsic  silk, and a well-made hood ; they set steel shoes on his  feet, lap his legs in steel greaves ; put on the steel habergeon,  the well-burnished braces, elbow pieces, and gloves of  plate : while over all is placed the coat armour. His spurs  are then fixed, and his sword is attached to his side by a  silken girdle. Thus attired the knight hears mass, and  afterwards takes leave of Arthur and his Court.

His cheer oft changed before  he found the chapel ; many a cliff he climbed over, many  a ford and stream he crossed, and everywhere he found a  foe. It were too tedious to tell the tenth part of his adven-  tures with serpents, wolves, and wild men ; with bulls,  bears, and boars.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='618'>Meanwhile, the lord pursued the wild boar, that bit the  backs of his hounds asunder, and caused the stoutest of his  hunters to start back. At last the beast was too exhausted  to run any more and entered a hole in a rock by the side  of a brook, the froth foaming at his mouth. None durst  approach him, so many had he torn with his tusks. The  knight, seeing the boar at bay, alights from his horse, and  seeks to attack him with his sword ; the boar rushes out  upon the man, who, aiming well, wounds him in the side,  and the wild beast is killed by the hounds.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='625'>Gawayne is called upon, when the hunt returns, to  receive the spoil, and the lord of the land is well pleased  when he sees him ; and shows him the wild boar, and tells  him of its length and breadth. ** Such a brawn of a  beast,** Sir Gawayne says he never has seen. To <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boar;covenant;return;kiss;host;guest' adjectives='wild;best' verbs='be;give;accord;declare;be;know'>Gawayne</entity>  then the wild boar is given, according to the covenant ;  and in return he kisses his host, who declares his guest to  be the best he knows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='626'>Tables are raised aloft, cloths laid upon them, and waxen  torches are lighted. With much mirth and glee supper is  served in the hall. When they had long played in the hall,  they went to the upper chamber, where they drank and  discoursed. Sir Gawayne at length begs leave of his host  to depart on the morrow ; but his host swears to him that  he must stay, and come to the Green Chapel on New  Yearns morn long before prime. So Gawayne consents to  remain for another night ; and full still and softly he  sleeps throughout it.</paragraph>

It was a clear, frosty  morning when they rode off, and the hunters, dispersed  by a wood"s side, came upon the track of a fox, which was  followed up by the hounds. And now they get sight of  the game, and pursue him through many a rough grove.  The fox at last leaps over a spinney, and by a rugged path "</paragraph>

But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='brake;spinney' adjectives='wily' verbs='be;lead'>Reynard</entity> was wily, and led them far  astray over brake and spinney.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='631'>Meanwhile, Sir Gawayne, left at home, soundly sleeps  within his comely curtains. At length the lady of the  castle, clothed in a rich mantle, comes to his chamber,  opens a window, and reproaches him :</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='633'>Sir Gawayne was dreaming of his forthcoming adven-  ture at the Green Chapel when she aroused him, but he  started up, and greeted his fair visitor. Again, as she had  done before, she desired some gift by which to remember  him when he was gone.</paragraph>

Gawayne again refuses to accept anything,  but promises, "* ever in hot and in cold, to be her true  servant.*" "</paragraph>

Then she takes her leave ;  Gawayne hides the girdle, and then hies to the chapel, and  asks pardon for any misdeeds he has ever done. When  he returns to the hall, he makes himself so merry among  the ladies with comely songs and carols, that they said :  ** This knight was so merry never before, since hither he  came to the castle !

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='642'>u"Meanwhile the lord of the castle was still in the field ;  he had already slain the fox. He had spied Reynard  coming through a ** rough grove "" and tried to strike him  with his sword ; but the fox was seized by one of the  hounds. The rest of the hunters hastened thither, with  horns full many, for it was the merriest meet that ever was  heard ; and carrying the fox"s skin and brush they all ride  home. The lord at last ahghts at his dear home, where he  finds Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lord;ahght;home;sir;lady;knight;host;covenant;kiss' adjectives='last;amusing' verbs='find;come;welcome;accord'>Gawayne</entity> amusing the ladies ; the knight comes  forward and welcomes his host, and according to covenant  kisses him thrice.

Gawayne takes leave of his host, and  thanks him for his happy sojourn. He asks for a man to  teach him the way to the Green Chapel.

Snow falls and the dale is full of deep drift,  Gawayne in his bed hears each cock that crows ; he calls  for the chamberlain, and bids him bring his armour.  Men knock off the rust from his rich habergeon, and the  knight then calls for his steed. While he clothed himself  in his rich garments, he forgot not the girdle, the lady\"s  gift, but with it doubly girded his loins ; he wore it not for  its rich ornaments, ** but to save himself when it behoved  him to suffer," All the people of the castle he thanked full  oft, and then was his steed Gringolet arrayed, full ready to  prick on. Sir Gawayne returns thanks for the honour  and kindness shown to him by all, and then he steps into  the saddle from the mounting-stone, and says, \"\" This  castle to Christ I commend ; may He give it ever good  chance ! *\"</paragraph>

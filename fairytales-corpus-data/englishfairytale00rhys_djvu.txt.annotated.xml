	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='16'>The tales in this book have been chosen from many  sources, which represent the old haunts of people, fairy-  tale people, like Mother Hubba-rd and Simple Simon, who  figure in rhyme or legend. /,,/</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='17'>Some of these" talcs have been forgotten, and some  have been lost or long-buried ; and there are several  that may seem hew to you who read them here to-day.  Such a story is that of the elfin Green Knight, which is  a case of a delightful old fairy-tale that grew into as  delightful a romance. A romance indeed is little else than  a fairy-tale for older folk. The romancers ** swapped "  (as schoolboys say) their good things, and in this way we  get a story like that of King Arthur and the Giant of St.  Michael"s Mount, which comes from the noble old roman-  cer. Sir Thomas Malory. For a fairy-tale, like a cat,  has nine lives ; it can pass into many queer shapes, and  yet not die. You may cut off its head, or drown it in  sentiment or sea-water, or tie a moral to its tail ; but  it will still survive, and be found sitting safe by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;tail;sea-water;sentiment' adjectives='safe;moral' verbs='be;cut;sit;drown;survive;tie;find' valence='5.62166666667' arousal='3.87777777778' dominance='5.43611111111'>the fire</entity>  some winter night.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>In the reign of King Arthur, there lived in the county of  Cornwall, near the Land"s End of England, a wealthy  farmer who had one only son called Jack. He was brisk  and of a ready lively wit, so that whatever he could not  perform by force and strength, he did by his quick wit and  cleverness. Never was any person heard of that could  worst him, and he very often even baffled wise men by his  sharp and ready invention.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a  huge and monstrous giant of eighteen feet in height, and  about three yards in girth, of a fierce and grim face, the  terror of all the towns and villages near. He lived in a  cave in the midst of the mount, and would not suffer any  one else to live near him. His food was other men"s cattle,  which often became his prey, for whensoever he wanted  food he would wade over to the mainland, where he would  furnish himself with whatever came in his way. The  good folk, at his approach, forsook their homes, while he</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='102'>seized on their cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-  dozen oxen on his back at a time ; and as for their sheep  and hogs, he would tie them round his waist like a bunch  of bandeliers. This course he had followed for many  years, so that all <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;robbery' adjectives='poor;many' verbs='follow;have;become' valence='5.00571428571' arousal='4.07857142857' dominance='4.98714285714'>Cornwall</entity> had become poor through his  robberies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>One day Jack, happening to be present at the town hall  when the magistrates were sitting in council about the  giant, asked what reward would be given to the person  who destroyed him. The giant"s treasure, they said, was  the reward. Quoth Jack, ** Then let me undertake it."*</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='104'>So he took a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over  to the Mount in the beginning of a dark winter"s evening,  when he fell to work, and before morning had dug a pit  twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as broad, covering it over  with long sticks and straw. Then strewing a little mould  upon it, it appeared like plain ground. This done, Jack  placed himself on the contrary side of the pit, farthest from  the giant"s lodging, and, just at the break of day, he put  the horn to his mouth, and blew, Tantivy, Tantivy. The  unexpected noise aroused the giant, who rushed from his  cave, crying : " You bold villain, are you come here to  disturb my rest ^ You shall pay dearly for this. Satis-  faction I will have, and this it shall be, I will take you whole  and broil you for breakfast," which he had no sooner  uttered, than tumbling into the pit, he made the very  foundations of the Mount to shake.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='110'>The news of Jack"s victory soon spread over all the West  of England, so that another giant, named Blunderbore,  hearing of it, vowed to be revenged on the little hero, if  ever it was his fortune to light on him. This giant was the  lord of an enchanted castle standing in the midst of a lone-  some wood. Now Jack, about four months afterwards,  walking near this wood in his journey to Wales, being  weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain and fell fast  asleep. While he was enjoying his repose, the giant,  coming for water, there found him, and knew him to be  the far-famed Jack by the lines written on the belt. With-  out ado, he took Jack on his shoulders and carried him  towards his enchanted castle. Now, as they passed  through a thicket, the rustling of the boughs awakened  Jack, who was strangely surprised to find himself in the  clutches of the giant. His terror was not yet begun, for  on entering the castle, he saw the ground strewed with  human bones, the giant telling him his own would ere long  be there also.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='115'>This dreadful noise had almost distracted Jack, who,  going to the window, beheld afar off the two giants coming  towards the castle. "* Now," quoth Jack to himself, ** my  death or my escape is at hand." Now, there were strong  cords in a corner of the room in which Jack was, and two  of these he took, and made a strong noose at the end ; and  while the giants were unlocking the iron gate of the castle  he threw the ropes over each of their heads. Then draw-  ing the other ends across a beam, and pulling with all his  might, he throttled them. Then, seeing they were black  in the face, and sliding down the rope, he came to their  heads, when they could not defend themselves, and draw-  ing his sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant"s  keys, and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies  tied by the hair of their heads, almost starved to death.  "* Sweet ladies," quoth Jack, ** I have killed this monster  and his brutish brother, and so set you free." This said,  he gave them the keys, and so went on his journey to  Wales. Having but little money, Jack found it well to  make the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could,  but losing his road, he was benighted, and could not get a  place to rest in until, coming into a narrow valley, he found  a large house, and by reason of his present needs took  courage to knock at the gate. But what was his surprise</paragraph>

At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who  struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club,  thinking he had broken every bone in Jack^s skin. The  next morning Jack, laughing in his sleeve, gave him hearty  thanks for his night"s lodging. "* How have you rested i *"  quoth the giant ; "* did you not feel anything in the night ^ *"  ** No,** quoth Jack, *" nothing but a rat, which gave me two  or three slaps with her tail.*" With that, greatly wondering,  the giant led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl con-  taining four gallons of hasty pudding. Being loath to let  the giant think it too much for him. Jack put a large leather  bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could convey  the pudding into it without its being seen. Then, telling  the giant he would show him a trick, taking a knife. Jack  ripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty pudding.  Whereupon, saying, ** Odds splutters, hur can do that  trick hurself,** the monster took the knife, and ripping  open his body, fell down dead.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='123'>Now, it fell in these days that King Arthur"s only son  begged his father to give him a large sum of money, in  order that he might go and seek his fortune in the country  of Wales, where lived a beautiful lady possessed with seven  evil spirits* The king did his best to persuade his son  from it, but in vain ; so at last granted the request, and the  prince set out with two horses, one loaded with money, the  other for himself to ride upon. Now, after several days"  travel, he came to a market-town in Wales, where he  beheld a vast crowd of people gathered together. The  prince asked the reason of it, and was told that they had  arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which  the dead man owed when he died. The prince replied  that it was a pity creditors should be so cruel, and said,  ** Go bury the dead, and let his creditors come to my  lodging, and there their debts shall be paid." So they  came, but in such great numbers that before night he had  almost left himself moneyless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='124'>Now Jack the Giant-killer, coming that way, was so  taken with the generosity of the prince, that he wished to be  his servant. This being agreed upon, the next morning  they set forward on their journey together, when, as they  were riding out of the town, an old woman called after the  prince, saying, ** He has owed me twopence these seven  years ; pray pay me as well as the rest."

His goggle eyes were like flames of fire, his face  grim and ugly, and his cheeks like a couple of large flitches  of bacon, while the bristles of his beard resembled rods of  iron wire, and the locks that hung down upon his brawny  shoulders were like curled snakes or hissing adders.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='254'>Once there was a King of Winchester called Orfeo, and  dearly he loved his queen, Heurodis. She happened one  hot afternoon in summer-time to be walking in the orchard,  when she became very drowsy ; and she lay down under an  imp tree/ and there she fell fast asleep. While she slept,  she had a strange dream. She dreamt that two fair  knights came to her side, and bade her come quickly with  them to speak to their lord and king. But she answered  them right boldly, that she neither dared nor cared to go  with them. So the two knights went away ; but very  quickly they returned, bringing their king with them, and  a thousand knights in his train, and many beauteous  ladies drest in pure white, riding on snow-white steeds.  The king had a crown on his head, not of silver or red-gold,  but all of precious stones that shone like the sun. By his  side was led a lady"s white palfrey that seemed to be pre-  pared for some rider, for its saddle was empty. He com-  manded that Heurodis should be placed upon this white  steed, and thereupon the King of Faerie and his train of  knights and white dames, and Heurodis beside him, rode  off through a fair country with many flowery meads, fields,  forests, and pleasant waters, where stood castles and towers  amid the green trees. Fairest of all, on a green terrace  overlooking many orchards and rose-gardens, stood the  Faerie King"s palace. When he had shown these things to</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='262'>Orfeo, when told the dream, resolved that on the morrow  he and a thousand knights should stand armed round the  Imp Tree to protect her from the Faerie King. And when  the time came, there they stood likb a ring of living steel  or a hedge of spears, to guard Heurodis. But in spite of  all, she was snatched away under their very eyes ; and in  vain were all their efforts to see which way she and her  faerie captors were gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='263'>Orfeo made search for his lost queen everywhere during  many days, but no footstep of her was to be found in upper  earth. And then in sorrow for her, and in utter despair,  he left his palace at Winchester, gave up his throne, and  went into the wilderness, carrying only a harp for com-  panion. With its tunes, as he sang to it, sorrowing for  Heurodis, the wild beasts were enchanted and often came  round about him  yea, wolf and fox, bear and little squirrel   to hear him play.

Other times he saw these  faerie knights and ladies dance, dressed Hke guisers, with  tabors beating and joyous trumpets blowing. And one day  Orfeo saw sixty lovely ladies ride out to the riverside for  falconry, each with her falcon on her bare hand, and in the  very midst of them (oh wonder !) rode his lost queen,  Heurodis. He determined at once to follow them ; and  after flying their falcons they return through the forest at  evening to a wild rocky place, where they ride into the rock  through a rude cleft, overhung with brambles. They ride  in, a league and more, till they come to the fairest country  ever seen, where it is high midsummer and broad sunhght.  In its midst stands a palace of an hundred towers, with  walls of crystal, and windows coped and arched with gold.  All that land was light, because when the night should come,  the precious stones in the palace walls gave out a Hght as  bright as noonday. Into this palace hall Orfeo entered, in  the train of the ladies, and saw there the King of Faerie on  his throne. The king was enraged at first when he saw  the strange man enter with his harp. But Orfeo offers to  play upon it, and Heurodis, when she hears, is filled with  longing, while the Faerie King is so enchanted that he  promises to Orfeo any gift he likes to ask out of all the  riches of the faerie regions. But Orfeo, to this, has only  one word to reply : "* Heurodis ! "</paragraph>

She could not have been a  good, honest old Woman ; for first she looked in at the  window, and then she peeped in at the keyhole ; and seeing  nobody in the house, she lifted the latch.

If she had been a good little old  Woman, she would have waited till the Bears came home ;  and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast ;  for they were good Bears,  a little rough or so, as the  manners of Bears are, but for all that very good-natured  and hospitable.

There he must meet the Worm face to face,  trusting the issue to Providence and his good sword.

At the accustomed hour  the Worm uncoiled its ** snaky twine," and wound its way  towards the hall, crossing the river close by the rock on  which the knight was standing eager for the combat.

On the  morn he asks for his arms ; a carpet is spread on the floor,  and he steps thereon. He is dubbed in a doublet of Tarsic  silk, and a well-made hood ; they set steel shoes on his  feet, lap his legs in steel greaves ; put on the steel habergeon,  the well-burnished braces, elbow pieces, and gloves of  plate : while over all is placed the coat armour. His spurs  are then fixed, and his sword is attached to his side by a  silken girdle. Thus attired the knight hears mass, and  afterwards takes leave of Arthur and his Court. By that  time his horse Gringolet was ready, the harness of which  glittered hke the gleam of the sun. Then Sir Gawayne  sets his helmet upon his head, and the circle around it was  decked with diamonds ; and they give him his shield with  the ** pentangle "* of pure gold, devised by King Solomon  as a token of truth ; for it is called the endless knot, and  well becomes the good Sir Gawayne, a knight the truest of  speech and the fairest of form. He was found faultless  in his five wits ; the image of the Virgin was depicted upon  his shield : in courtesy he was never found wanting, and  therefore was the endless knot fastened on his shield.</paragraph>

His cheer oft changed before  he found the chapel ; many a cliff he climbed over, many  a ford and stream he crossed, and everywhere he found a  foe. It were too tedious to tell the tenth part of his adven-  tures with serpents, wolves, and wild men ; with bulls,  bears, and boars. Had he not been both brave and good,  doubtless he had been dead ; the sharp winter was far worse  than any war that ever troubled him.

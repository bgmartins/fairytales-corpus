	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='35'>There are, roughly speaking, two distinct types of Scottish <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tale;type' adjectives='distinct;scottish' verbs='be;speak' valence='6.09428571429' arousal='3.65857142857' dominance='5.67142857143'>Fairy</entity> Tales.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='36'>There are what may be called "Celtic Stories," which were handed down for centuries by word of mouth by professional story-tellers, who went about from clachan to clachan in the "Highlands and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='clachan;celtic;highlands;word;entertainment;shelter;s;other;stories;mouth;story-teller' adjectives='professional' verbs='be;earn;clachan;give;hand;collect;call;have;go;classify' valence='6.02153846154' arousal='4.04807692308' dominance='5.58307692308'>Islands</entity>," earning a night"s shelter by giving a night"s entertainment, and which have now been collected and classified for us by Campbell of Isla and others.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='37'>These stories, which are also common to the North of Ireland, are wild and fantastic, and very often somewhat monotonous, and their themes are strangely alike. They almost always tell of some hero or heroine who sets out on some dangerous quest, and who is met by giants, generally three in number, who appear one after the other; with whom they hold quaint dialogues, and whom eventually they slay. Most of them are fairly long, and although they have a peculiar fascination of their own, they are quite distinct from the ordinary <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fascination;tale' adjectives='distinct;most;ordinary;own;peculiar' verbs='be;have' valence='5.841' arousal='3.917' dominance='5.765'>Fairy</entity> Tale.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='38'>These latter, in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='country;character;date;existence;goblin;spirit' adjectives='latter;own;recent' verbs='be;believe;have' valence='5.88714285714' arousal='4.11071428571' dominance='5.57285714286'>Scotland</entity>, have also a character of their own, for there is no country where the existence of Spirits and Goblins has been so implicitly believed in up to a comparatively recent date.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='39'>As a proof of this we can go to Hogg"s tale of "The Wool-gatherer," and see how the countryman, Barnaby, voices the belief of his day. "Ye had need to tak care how ye dispute the existence of fairies, brownies, and apparitions! Ye may as weel dispute the Gospel of Saint <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gospel;saint;dispute' adjectives='' verbs='weel' valence='4.9375' arousal='3.48' dominance='4.935'>Matthew</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='40'>Perhaps it was the bleak and stern character of their climate, and the austerity of their religious beliefs which made our Scottish forefathers think of the spirits in whom they so firmly believed, as being, for the most part, mischievous and malevolent.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='41'>Their Bogies, their Witches, their Kelpies, even their <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='league;tiend;being;kelpy;cost;witch;bogie;hell' adjectives='uncanny' verbs='be;pay;compel;suppose;dread;fear;find;wonder' valence='5.20846153846' arousal='4.27615384615' dominance='5.24730769231'>Fairy Queen</entity> herself, were supposed to be in league with the Evil One, and to be compelled, as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='league;tiend;being;kelpy;cost;witch;bogie;hell' adjectives='uncanny' verbs='be;pay;compel;suppose;dread;fear;find;wonder' valence='5.20846153846' arousal='4.27615384615' dominance='5.24730769231'>Thomas of Ercildoune</entity> was near finding out to his cost, to pay a "Tiend to Hell" every seven years; so it was not to be wondered at, that these uncanny beings were dreaded and feared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='42'>But along with this dark and gloomy view, we find touches of delicate playfulness and brightness. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sith;league;dwelling;sward;tale;case;knowe;satan;earshot;respect;law;folk;subject' adjectives='rocky;many;same;charming;dewy;silent' verbs='be;dance;bind;make;come;tell;speak' valence='5.88583333333' arousal='3.99416666667' dominance='5.94583333333'>Fairy Queen</entity> might be in league with Satan, but her subjects were not all bound by the same law, and many charming tales are told of the "sith" or silent folk, who were always spoken of with respect, in case they might be within earshot, who made their dwellings under some rocky knowe, and who came out and danced on the dewy sward at midnight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>Akin to them are the tales which are told about a mysterious region under the sea, "far below the abode of fishes," where a strange race of beings lived, who, in their own land closely resembled human beings, and were of such surpassing beauty that they charmed the hearts of all who looked on them. They were spoken of as Mermaids and Mermen, and as their lungs were not adapted for breathing under water, they had the extraordinary power of entering into the skin of some fish or sea animal, and in this way passing from their own abode to our upper world, where they held converse with mortal men, and, as often as not, tried to lure them to destruction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='44'>The popular idea always represents Mer-folk as wearing the tails of fishes; in Scottish Folklore they are quite as often found in the form of seals.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='45'>Then we frequently come across the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='notice;shaggy;helper;appearance;beast;drudgery;half;wages;creature;sin;man' adjectives='lovable;unkempt;strange' verbs='be;entail;forbid;work;ordain;receive;say;take;come;disappear;look' valence='5.5976' arousal='4.1304' dominance='5.5856'>Brownie</entity>, that strange, kindly, lovable creature, with its shaggy, unkempt appearance, half man, half beast, who was said to be the ordained helper of man in the drudgery entailed by sin, and was therefore forbidden to receive wages; who always worked when no one was looking, and who disappeared if any notice were taken of him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='46'>There are also, as in all other countries, animal tales, where the animals are endowed with the power of speech; and weird tales of enchantment; and last, but not least, there are the legendary stories, many of them half real, half mythical, which are to be found in the pages of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='minstrelsy;sir;story;power;enchantment;country;tale;s;speech;animal;border;page' adjectives='real;last;mythical;endowed;half;least;other;legendary;many;weird' verbs='be;find' valence='6.12291666667' arousal='4.08708333333' dominance='5.70958333333'>Hogg</entity>, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='minstrelsy;sir;story;power;enchantment;country;tale;s;speech;animal;border;page' adjectives='real;last;mythical;endowed;half;least;other;legendary;many;weird' verbs='be;find' valence='6.12291666667' arousal='4.08708333333' dominance='5.70958333333'>Leyden</entity>, and above all, in Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='minstrelsy;sir;story;power;enchantment;country;tale;s;speech;animal;border;page' adjectives='real;last;mythical;endowed;half;least;other;legendary;many;weird' verbs='be;find' valence='6.12291666667' arousal='4.08708333333' dominance='5.70958333333'>Walter Scott</entity>"s "Border Minstrelsy."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='156'>But all things, be they good or bad, pass in time, and at last the darkness began to lighten, and the light grew stronger, until they were back in broad sunshine.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='157'>Then Thomas took courage, and looked up; and lo, they were riding through a beautiful orchard, where apples and pears, dates and figs and wine-berries grew in great abundance.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='552'>"That is my father," said his guide, "whom thou wounded this morning, thinking that he was one of the common seals who live in the sea, instead of a Merman who hath speech, and understanding, as you mortals have.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='555'>Then there was great rejoicing throughout the whole Palace of the Seals.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='556'>But all this while the seal catcher stood alone in a corner, with his mind filled with dark thoughts, for although he saw now that they had no intention of killing him, he did not relish the prospect of spending the rest of his life in the guise of a seal, fathoms deep under <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='prospect;life;catcher;mind;fathom;rest;thought;intention;seal;guise;corner' adjectives='dark' verbs='do;spend;see;kill;stand;have;relish;fill' valence='5.36423076923' arousal='3.94807692308' dominance='5.42346153846'>the ocean</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='560'>"That will I do right gladly," he replied, for although the promise meant giving up his means of livelihood, he felt that if only he regained his proper shape he could always turn his hand to something else.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='561'>So he took the required oath with all due solemnity, holding up his fin as he swore, and all the other seals crowded round him as witnesses. And a sigh of relief went through the halls when the words were spoken, for he was the most noted seal catcher in the North.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='562'>Then he bade the strange company farewell, and, accompanied by his guide, passed once more through the outer doors of coral, and up, and up, and up, through the shadowy green water, until it began to grow lighter and lighter and at last they emerged into the sunshine of earth.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='566'>Then it all happened as it happened before. The bridle was shaken, and the horse galloped off, and it was not long before the seal catcher found himself standing in safety before his own garden gate.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='567'>He held out his hand to say "good-bye," but as he did so the stranger pulled out a huge bag of gold and placed it in it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='568'>"Thou hast done thy part of the bargain--we must do ours," he said. "Men shall never say that we took away an honest man"s work without making reparation for it, and here is what will keep thee in comfort to thy life"s end."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='973'>About two hundred years ago there was a poor man working as a labourer on a farm in Lanarkshire. He was what is known as an "Orra Man"; that is, he had no special work mapped out for him to do, but he was expected to undertake odd jobs of any kind that happened to turn up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='974'>One day his master sent him out to cast peats on a piece of moorland that lay on a certain part of the farm.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='975'>The man obeyed, and, being a willing fellow, when he arrived at the moor he set to work with all his might and main. He had lifted quite a quantity of peat from near the Crag, when he was startled by the appearance of the very smallest woman that he had ever seen in his life. She was only about two feet high, and she was dressed in a green gown and red stockings, and her long yellow hair was not bound by any ribbon, but hung loosely round her shoulders.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='976'>She was such a dainty little creature that the astonished countryman stopped working, stuck his spade into the ground, and gazed at her in wonder.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='977'>His wonder increased when she held up one of her tiny fingers and addressed him in these words: "What wouldst thou think if I were to send my husband to uncover thy house? You mortals think that you can do aught that pleaseth you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='978'>Then, stamping her tiny foot, she added in a voice of command, "Put back that turf instantly, or thou shalt rue this day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='979'>Now the poor man had often heard of the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='harm;spot;labour;mortal;fear;divot;folk;man' adjectives='poor;unthinking;exact' verbs='set;work;undo;hear;take;have;offend;place;tremble' valence='4.9065' arousal='4.156' dominance='5.273'>Fairy</entity> Folk and of the harm that they could work to unthinking mortals who offended them, so in fear and trembling he set to work to undo all his labour, and to place every divot in the exact spot from which he had taken it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='980'>When he was finished he looked round for his strange visitor, but she had vanished completely; he could not tell how, nor where. Putting up his spade, he wended his way homewards, and going straight to his master, he told him the whole story, and suggested that in future the peats should be taken from the other end of the moor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='981'>[Illustration: A large band of Fairies dancing Round and Round]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='982'>But the master only laughed. He was a strong, hearty man, and had no belief in Ghosts, or Elves, or Fairies, or any other creature that he could not see; but although he laughed, he was vexed that his servant should believe in such things, so to cure him, as he thought, of his superstition, he ordered him to take a horse and cart and go back at once, and lift all the peats and bring them to dry in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ghost;horse;belief;servant;elf;peat;fairies;cart;superstition;thing;man;steading;creature' adjectives='dry;such;strong;other;hearty' verbs='be;have;lift;vex;order;bring;see;cure;take;laugh;go;believe;think' valence='5.82903225806' arousal='4.19935483871' dominance='5.7564516129'>the farm</entity> steading.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='984'>In fact, he began to think that his master was right, and that the whole thing must have been a dream.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='985'>So matters went smoothly on. Winter passed, and spring, and summer, until autumn came round once more, and the very day arrived on which the peats had been lifted the year before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='986'>That day, as the sun went down, the orra man left <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wife;orra;sun;master;can;cottage;home;milk;man' adjectives='little;hard' verbs='be;give;work;please;leave;carry;have;go' valence='6.18' arousal='4.01851851852' dominance='5.67074074074'>the farm</entity> to go home to his cottage, and as his master was pleased with him because he had been working very hard lately, he had given him a little can of milk as a present to carry home to his wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='987'>So he was feeling very happy, and as he walked along he was humming a tune to himself. His road took him by the foot of Merlin"s Crag, and as he approached it he was astonished to find himself growing strangely tired. His eyelids dropped over his eyes as if he were going to sleep, and his feet grew as heavy as lead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='988'>"I will sit down and take a rest for a few minutes," he said to himself; "<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='home;rest' adjectives='to-day' verbs='do;say;take;seem;sit' valence='5.70461538462' arousal='3.89153846154' dominance='5.61384615385'>the road</entity> home never seemed so long as it does to-day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='989'>So he sat down on a tuft of grass right under the shadow of the Crag, and before he knew where he was he had fallen into a deep and heavy slumber.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='990'>When he awoke it was near midnight, and the moon had risen on the Crag. And he rubbed his eyes, when by its soft light he became aware of a large band of Fairies who were dancing round and round him, singing and laughing, pointing their tiny fingers at him, and shaking their wee fists in his face.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='991'>The bewildered man rose and tried to walk away from them, but turn in whichever direction he would the Fairies accompanied him, encircling him in a magic ring, out of which he could in no wise go.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='992'>At last they stopped, and, with shrieks of elfin laughter, led the prettiest and daintiest of their companions up to him, and cried, "Tread a measure, tread a measure, Oh, Man! Then wilt thou not be so eager to escape from our company."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='993'>Now the poor labourer was but a clumsy dancer, and he held back with a shamefaced air; but the Fairy who had been chosen to be his partner reached up and seized his hands, and lo! some strange magic seemed to enter into his veins, for in a moment he found himself waltzing and whirling, sliding and bowing, as if he had done nothing else but dance all his life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='994'>And, strangest thing of all! he forgot about his home and his children; and he felt so happy that he had no longer the slightest desire to leave the Fairies" company.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='995'>All night long the merriment went on. The Little Folk danced and danced as if they were mad, and the farm man danced with them, until at last a shrill sound came over the moor. It was the cock from the farmyard crowing its loudest to welcome the dawn.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='996'>In an instant the revelry ceased, and the Fairies, with cries of alarm, crowded together and rushed towards the Crag, dragging the countryman along in their midst. As they reached the rock, a mysterious door, which he never remembered having seen before, opened in it of its own accord, and shut again with a crash as soon as the Fairy Host had all trooped through.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='998'>But there seemed to be some kind of spell thrown over his senses, for even when the Fairies awoke and began to go about their household occupations, and to carry out certain curious practices which he had never seen before, and which, as you will hear, he was forbidden to speak of afterwards, he was content to sit and watch them, without in any way attempting to escape.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='999'>As it drew toward evening someone touched his elbow, and he turned round with a start to see the little woman with the green dress and scarlet stockings, who had remonstrated with him for lifting the turf the year before, standing by his side.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1049'>I will tell you why he did so. Not very far from the Stone there was a curious hill, shaped exactly like a wart.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1052'>He was always accompanied on these occasions by an enormous grey-headed Raven, who lived in the cave along with him, and who was his bosom friend and companion. The Islanders feared this bird of ill omen as much, perhaps, as they feared its Master; for, although they went to consult Snorro in all their difficulties and perplexities, and bought medicines and love-potions from him, they always looked upon him with a certain dread, feeling that there was something weird and uncanny about him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1053'>Now, at the time we are speaking of, Orkney was governed by two Earls, who were half-brothers. Paul, the elder, was a tall, handsome man, with dark hair, and eyes like sloes.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1191'>"I"m not going to broach another barrel," he said gruffly, handing back the half-filled can to the little lad.

Nor, though the butler took pains to ask all round the country-side, could he ever hear of him again, nor of anyone who knew anything about him, or anything about his sick mother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1201'>Years passed by, and sore trouble fell upon the House o" Co".

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1202'>It was the night before his execution, and he was sitting in his lonely cell, thinking sadly of his wife and children, whom he never expected to see again.

Then, all unbidden, a vision of the little lad carrying the can, who had come to beg ale for his sick mother, and whom he had long ago forgotten, rose up before him.</paragraph>

No, no. It behoveth us to have foresight, and to lay up in store for the spring, when the grain is all threshed, and the stackyards are bare, and the poultry have gone to market.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1562'>Very reluctantly, for he was thinner and hungrier than the Fox, the Wolf agreed to this proposal. So a hole was dug, and the Keg was buried, and the two animals went off hunting as usual.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1592'>"It is thy turn now," he said. "I have sworn, and thou must do so also."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1593'>The Fox"s face fell at these words, for although he was both untruthful and dishonest now, he had been well brought up in his youth, and he knew that it was a terrible thing to perjure oneself and swear falsely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1594'>So he made one excuse after another, but the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='excuse;moment' adjectives='suspicious;more' verbs='be;make;listen;get' valence='5.763' arousal='3.892' dominance='5.369'>Wolf</entity>, who was getting more and more suspicious every moment, would not listen to him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1601'>After he had heard him swear this terrible oath, the Wolf thought that his suspicions must be groundless, and he would have let the matter rest; but the Fox, having an uneasy conscience, could not do so. So he suggested that as it was clear that one of them must have eaten the Keg of Butter, they should both stand near the fire; so that when they became hot, the butter would ooze out of the skin of whichever of them was guilty.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1604'>But the Wolf had seen the Fox beginning to grow greasy, and he knew now what had happened, and he determined to have his revenge.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1606'>And the silly Fox, who was very vain, and did not like to confess that his eyes were no better than those of his friend, went close up to the door to try and read the writing.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1837'>Some of them were carding wool, some of them were combing it, some of them were spinning it, constantly wetting their fingers with their lips, in order to twist the yarn fine as they drew it from the distaff, and some of them were spinning the yarn into cloth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1838'>While round and round the circle, cracking a little whip, and urging them to work faster, was a Yellow-Haired Peerie Boy.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1846'>Meanwhile the Giant was coming down the hill in the darkening, and, to his astonishment, he met a troop of little Peerie Folk toiling up it, looking as if they were so tired that they could hardly get along. Their eyes were dim and listless, their heads were hanging on their breasts, and their lips were so long and twisted that the poor little people looked quite hideous.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1847'>The Giant asked how this was, and they told him that they had to work so hard all day, spinning for their Master that they were quite exhausted; and that the reason why their lips were so distorted was that they used them constantly to wet their fingers, so that they might pull the wool in very fine strands from the distaff.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1848'>"I always thought a great deal of women who could spin," said the Giant, "and I looked out for a housewife that could do so.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1851'>"By my troth, thou art an industrious maiden," he said, in high good humour, "and, as a reward for working so diligently, I will restore thy sisters to thee." And he went out to the byre, and lifted the two other Princesses down from the rafters, and brought them in and laid them on the settle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1852'>Their little sister nearly screamed aloud when she saw how ill they looked and how bruised their backs were, but, like a prudent maiden, she held her tongue, and busied herself with applying a cooling ointment to their wounds, and binding them up, and by and by her sisters revived, and, after the Giant had gone to bed, they told her all that had befallen them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1853'>"I will be avenged on him for his cruelty," said the little <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sister;cruelty' adjectives='little' verbs='be;say;know;avenge;speak;mean' valence='5.56357142857' arousal='4.46857142857' dominance='5.57571428571'>Princess</entity> firmly; and when she spoke like that her sisters knew that she meant what she said.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1859'>The next morning the little Princess told him that she thought that she would go for a long walk after she had done her housework, and that she might not be in when he came home at night, but that she would have another creel of grass ready for him, if he would carry it to the cottage as he had done on the two previous evenings. He promised to do so; then, as usual, he went out for the day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1860'>In the afternoon the clever little maiden went through the house, gathering together all the lace, and silver, and jewellery that she could find, and brought them and placed them beside the creel.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1861'>Then she crept into the creel herself, and pulled all the fine things in above her, and then she covered everything up with the grass, which was a very difficult thing to do, seeing she herself was at the bottom of the basket.

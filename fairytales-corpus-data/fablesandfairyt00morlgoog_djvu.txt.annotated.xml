Then the child made her friends sit down to rest ; one  in her father\"s chair, one in her mother\"s, and one on  her own little stool. She raked the embers of the fire and  put on fresh wood until a blaze leapt up that was strong  enough to warm them, before she would turn aside.  Then standing in a comer by the morsel of window  that looked out towards the waterfall, she gave way to  her sobbing. But again  ^brave little heart  conquer-  ing herself, she came forward to where the monsters  were sitting, with their legs crossed, basking in the  firelight, and said, *\" I am sorry, dear, kind neighbours,  that I have no supper to offer you."</paragraph>

It was long since the sun set,  reddening the mists of the plain, and now the mountain  path beside the torrent was all dark and very peiilous.  The monsters eagerly watched their little hostess with  their brilliant eyes, and assented, as it seemed, with  exultation, to her wish that they would sleep in the  hut. There were but two beds under its loof, Meli-  lot"s own little straw pallet, and that on which her parents  were to sleep no more, on which she was no more to kneel  beside them in the humble morning prayer. With sacred  thoughts of hospitality the child gave up to the use of  those who had smoothed for her dear parents a new  bed, the bed that was no longer theirs. And the three  monsters, after looking at her gratefully, lay down on it  together and went to sleep on it, with their arms twisted  about each other"s necks.

A night not altogether black,  for there was a short lull in the rain, though the wind  howled round the mountain, and through a chance break  in the scurrying night- clouds the full moon now and  then flashed, lighting the lakes in tlie valley far below,  and causing the toiTent outside the window to gleam  through the night shadows of the great rocks among  which it fell.

I neglected my  business. I disappeared from the earth"s surface. A  boy, who worked a basket by means of a rope and  pulley, aided me ; so aided, I confined my whole atten-  tion to spade labour. The centripetal force seemed to  have made me its especial victim- I dug on until  Autumn. In the beginning of November I observed  that, upon percussion, the sound given by the floor of  my pit was resonant. I did not intermit my labour,  urged as I was by a mysterious instinct downwards.  On applying my ear, I occasionally heard a subdued  sort of rattle, which caused me to form a theory that the  centre of the earth might be composed of mucus. In  November, the ground broke beneath me into a hollow,  and I fell a considerable distance. I alighted on the  box-seat of a four-horse coach, which "happened to be  running at that time immediately underneath. The  coachman took no notice whatever of my sudden arrival  by his side. He was so completely muflfled up, that I  could observe only the skilful way in which he handled  reins and whip. The horses were yellow. I had seen  no more than this, when the guard"s horn blew, and  presently we pulled up at an inn. A waiter came out,  and appeared to collect four bags from the passengers  inside the coach.

One passenger only had a complete face of  flesh, he had also one living hand; the other hand I  guessed was bony, because it was concealed in a glove  obviously padded.

However, I compelled him to explain to me what  was the reason of these things. The information I  obtained, was briefly this :  that Nature, in Skitzland,  never removes the stomach. Everyman has to feed  himself; and the necessity for finding food, joined to the  necessity for buying clothes, is a mainspring whereby  the whole clockwork of civilised life is kept in motion.  Now, if a man positively cannot feed and clothe himself^  he becomes a pauper. He then goes to the workhouse,  where he has his stomach filled with a cement. That  stopping lasts a life-time, and he thereafter needs no  food. His body, however, becomes yellow by the  superfluity of bile. The yellow-boy, which is the Skitz-  land epithet for pauper, is at the same time provided  with a suit of clothes. The clothes are of a material so  tough that they can be worn unrepaired for more than  eighty years. 1"he pauper is now freed from care, but  were he in this state cast loose upon society, since he has  not that stimulus to labour which excites industry in  other men, he would become an element of danger in the  state. Nature no longer compelling him to work, the  law compels him. The remainder of his life is forfeit to  " the uses of his country. He labours at the workhouse,  costing nothing more thajU the expense of lodging, after  the first inconsideiable putlay for cement wherewith to  r -i-w stomach, and for the one suit of ai^i^ai^l.

Our  , volcanoes, it is now proved, are situated over the market-  places of various provincial towns in Skitzland. When  a revolutibn happens, the rebels are shot up,  discharged  from mortars by means of an explosive material evidently  far more powerful than our gunpowder or gun-cotton ;  and they are pulverised by the friction in grinding their  way through the earth.

By his order they were amassing heaps of all the herbs  that grew in and around the forest, because he had picked  ,out of Saintfoin"s story the important fact that there was  some herb, which, if it touched Madam Pidge, would  put an end to all her troubling. His plan was, that,  when she appeared, his big brethren should discharge  against her at random every green thing that could be  pulled. He hoped that some one of them would perhaps  give her the finishing touch. "</paragraph>

Wild barley was the herb.  Now Madam Bat might fly her highest. She could not  escape the long arms of a hundred giants. Twelve of  them falling on the rock, tore open a free passage for  Sir Aylevan, while Saintfoin stood among the ferns upon  the threshold of her cavern. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bat;hand;cage;twig' adjectives='' verbs='hold;weave'>Hayo</entity> must hold the bat  in his hand tenderly, while <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bat;hand;cage;twig' adjectives='' verbs='hold;weave'>Hoya</entity> wove for it a cage of  twigs.

They would escort their little Saint-  foin back- to Fairy-land, and see that she was properly  received by Oberon. In vain their darling laughed at  them, pleaded, -and scolded. Being stupid, they had  full right to be obstinate. Instead of yielding, they  made matters worse. Saint foin, trembling with tender  expectation, longed to slip back alone, like a forgiven  child, and receive from Titania the kiss so long denied.  But he^ there were not only all the giants in the forest  stubbornly determined upon going with her : all her  friends were agreed to see her home, and break into the  Fairy circle if she were repulsed. When evening came,  the bear only paced about under the trees ; he would  not sleep.

Behind  them there came tramping among the pine-trees the pro-  cession of the giants, and above came the light flying  squadron of the butterflies and all the birds by whom  the march music was played. It was not performed by  them very briskly, for, in spite of all their efforts, they  were sleepy, and flew often against the trees. Among  the trees, on either side, ran a swift crowd of leverets  and fawns and gentle creatures of the wood.</paragraph>

She held her hand  to Saintfoin, who at once leapt as a tiny Fairy to her  side. " I know, " she said, " what evil I have done. Let  the bat fly whither she will.

The frankincense of his heart was  melted in a Fairy censer, and the world about him was  the temple that its perfume filled. His home seemed to  be lonely ; he was ill-favoured, and sought no wife. But  sometimes, when, after a day worthily spent, he sat, at  twilight, by the embers in his great dim hall, he saw the  silken locks of his child Fairy scattered upon his arm,  and might look down into her deep, blue eyes, glittering  up at him with smiles or tears, or shining steadily with  love. To Sir Aylevan, in his joy and in his sorrow, often  there came the little Saintfoin, claiming right to nestle  on his lap. So there was no place like that home of his,  and no child dearer to its mother than that fondling  Fairy to the Knight.</paragraph>

They had no children,  and they lived in a lone cottage together, on a great  lump of a moorland hill that had a large iron beacon on  the top. In the grate of the beacon an old man, named  Moonseed, the only other person living on the hill,  lighted a fire of nights for the guidance of ships in a  sea channel full of perilous shoals, currents, and tide-  ways, from which the broad back of the hill could be  seen, when clouds were not too low. That hill was a  huge waste of stone, lichen, puff-ball, and fern ; of bog,  moss, rush, horse-tail, and liver- wort, covering a tall  heap of peat-bog, marshes, pools, and pebbly wastes of  marl, cornstone, and red conglomerate, that rose and  rose for miles about, until it came to a head wherein the  clouds hung when there was any rain ^t hand. When  the rain really came, it flooded the pools into lakes,  soaked with water the great spongy marshes, and made  of nearly the whole mountain a slough, over which the  driving mists raced after one another, and the water  plashed till only the wild ducks and the bitterns would  choose to be out of doors.

For Menisper was expected to  do all that a good cottager"s wife ought to do : to cook,  to market, to keep fowls and a pig ; and it was no small  trouble to her, when she came from market with a  heavy basket on her arm, home to the place where she  had left her house, and found that it had pleased Picro-  toxin, in her absence, to move to the opposite side of the  hill. If he had carried off the cottage and forgotten to  take with it the poultry and the pig, the poor woman  had to take them along with her in a search over the  mountain side. Again, if Picrotoxin wished to keep his  wife in her own natural place, and to solace himself in  the intervals of conjuring with that happy pastoral life  to which, as a country maid, she had been bom, he  ought not to have turned away from her hog"s lard and  fried potatoes, her rich soup of oatmeal and treacle, her  hard buttered dumpling, or neglected to praise her bold  execution of the favourite pie of the district, made of  successive layers of sliced apple, bacon -fat, and onion,  thick layers and plenty of them, covered in with a stout  oily pie-crust. Her pies could be smelt out at sea,  when Menisper was baking them ; and once a ship was  wrecked in the channel below, because the pilot held  his nose, instead of steering, when it was a pie-day on  the hill-side. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wife;conjurer;dinner' adjectives='much' verbs='determine;market;make;bake;be;eat;prepare'>Yet Picrotoxin</entity>, though determined that  his wife should market, make, and bake, was too much  of a conjurer to eat the dinners she prepared for him.

It was long since the sun set,  reddening the mists of the plain, and now the mountain  path beside the torrent was all dark and very peiilous.  The monsters eagerly watched their little hostess with  their brilliant eyes, and assented, as it seemed, with  exultation, to her wish that they would sleep in the  hut. There were but two beds under its loof, Meli-  lot"s own little straw pallet, and that on which her parents  were to sleep no more, on which she was no more to kneel  beside them in the humble morning prayer. With sacred  thoughts of hospitality the child gave up to the use of  those who had smoothed for her dear parents a new  bed, the bed that was no longer theirs.

I neglected my  business. I disappeared from the earth"s surface. A  boy, who worked a basket by means of a rope and  pulley, aided me ; so aided, I confined my whole atten-  tion to spade labour. The centripetal force seemed to  have made me its especial victim- I dug on until  Autumn. In the beginning of November I observed  that, upon percussion, the sound given by the floor of  my pit was resonant. I did not intermit my labour,  urged as I was by a mysterious instinct downwards.  On applying my ear, I occasionally heard a subdued  sort of rattle, which caused me to form a theory that the  centre of the earth might be composed of mucus. In  November, the ground broke beneath me into a hollow,  and I fell a considerable distance. I alighted on the  box-seat of a four-horse coach, which "happened to be  running at that time immediately underneath. The  coachman took no notice whatever of my sudden arrival  by his side. He was so completely muflfled up, that I  could observe only the skilful way in which he handled  reins and whip. The horses were yellow. I had seen  no more than this, when the guard"s horn blew, and  presently we pulled up at an inn. A waiter came out,  and appeared to collect four bags from the passengers  inside the coach.

One passenger only had a complete face of  flesh, he had also one living hand; the other hand I  guessed was bony, because it was concealed in a glove  obviously padded. By observing the fit of his clothes,  I came to a conclusion that this gentleman was stuffed  throughout; that all his limbs, except the head and  hand, were artificial.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>A superintendent of police remarked that I was losing  opportunities of real enjoyment for the idle purpose of  persisting in my fable of having dropped down from the  sky. However, I compelled him to explain to me what  was the reason of these things. The information I  obtained, was briefly this :  that Nature, in Skitzland,  never removes the stomach. Everyman has to feed  himself; and the necessity for finding food, joined to the  necessity for buying clothes, is a mainspring whereby  the whole clockwork of civilised life is kept in motion.  Now, if a man positively cannot feed and clothe himself^  he becomes a pauper. He then goes to the workhouse,  where he has his stomach filled with a cement. That  stopping lasts a life-time, and he thereafter needs no  food. His body, however, becomes yellow by the  superfluity of bile. The yellow-boy, which is the Skitz-  land epithet for pauper, is at the same time provided  with a suit of clothes. The clothes are of a material so  tough that they can be worn unrepaired for more than  eighty years. 1"he pauper is now freed from care, but  were he in this state cast loose upon society, since he has  not that stimulus to labour which excites industry in  other men, he would become an element of danger in the  state. Nature no longer compelling him to work, the  law compels him. The remainder of his life is forfeit to  " the uses of his country. He labours at the workhouse,  costing nothing more thajU the expense of lodging, after  the first inconsideiable putlay for cement wherewith to  r -i-w stomach, and for the one suit of ai^i^ai^l.</paragraph>

The superintendent told me that  I had sadly flittered away time, for I- had now no more  than half an hour to live. Upon that I leaned ray back  against a post, and asked him to prepare me for my part  in the impending ceremony by giving me a little infor-  mation on the subject of executions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='428'>I found that it was usual for a man to be executed  with great ceremony upon the spot whereon his crime  had been committed. That in case of rebellions or  tumults in the provinces, when large numbers were not  unfrequently condemned to death, the sentence of the  law was caixied out in the chief towns of the disturbed  districts* That large numbers of people were thus  sometimes discharged from a single market-place, and  that the repeated strokes appeared to shake, or crack, or  pierce in some degree that portion of the sky towards  which the artillery had been directed. 1 here at once  saw that I had discovered the true cause of earthquakes  and volcanoes ; and this shows how great light may be  thrown upon theories conceniing the hidden constitution  of this earth by going more deeply into the matter of it than  had been done by any one before I dug my hole. Our  , volcanoes, it is now proved, are situated over the market-  places of various provincial towns in Skitzland. When  a revolutibn happens, the rebels are shot up,  discharged  from mortars by means of an explosive material evidently  far more powerful than our gunpowder or gun-cotton ;  and they are pulverised by the friction in grinding their  way through the earth. How simple and easy truth  appears, when we have once ariived at it.</paragraph>

Neroli and little Silver Tassels walked up  and down for some time through the scented groves and  among the palaces of Feathergrass, in vain search for a  place that they could make into a pleasant home. At  last they sat down in a large public garden to eat their  dry bread among the lilies which grew under the shadow  of some blossoming orange-trees.

These belonged to the merchants who owned a great  fiictory higher up by the waterside, where perfume of  roses was extracted for the markets of the world. The  runnings from the factory made rosewater of all the  streams.

Then he listened mischievously for the noise of  bcolding that had usually followed, but heard only two  soft voices. So he peeped down, and saw a fair woman,  with rich brown hair falling about her shoulders, and a  poor old dress, sooted in front, who was pouring into a  dish a few cooked roots out of a saucepan, into which the  soot had fallen.

One stitched the back of his fine hat to  the back of his coat-collar ; another sewed up his  pockets; another fastened the legs of his trousers to  his boots. Whatever \Vas hooked, tied, or buttoned of  the clothes he wore, the busy needles sewed up with  the neatest of invisible stitches, but so strongly, that  not even a knife could cut them through.

He dined alone with the Queen that day, and  was expected, after the cheese, to prefer his suit.

Everything must go smoothly to-night.  He would lite to go home at once, take off his periwig,  and search himself for pins; but if he did, he never  could hope to be King of Gossamer. So he made up his  mind, und with audible gulps,  which the Queen flat-  tered herself were hysterical,  swallowed the soup with  all the hair in it. It was not much easier to eat a piece  of fish, through which a whole skein of cotton had found  opportunity to entangle itself. As the skein was un-  divided, and would not be pulled away, it was necessary  (in order to escape observation) that my lord should eat  his bit of fish in one lump, when her Majesty happened  to look another way. The effort to do this was boldly  made, but it was unsuccessful. My lord managed to get  all his bit of fish into his mouth at once, but then the  threads hindered the swallowing. He turned black in  the face, and three doctors had been sent for before he  got it down. Nevertheless on such a momentous occa-  sion, he did not choose to be invalided. Happen what  might, he must fight through his dinner and secure the  prize of a Queen"s promise to be his wife before he slept  that night. The next dish served was pickled pork and  parsnips. He was not well, certainly, but surely he  could eat a bit of that. And as the Queen condoled  with him and he talked courteously to her, with a bit  of parsnip on the end of his fork, the lump of wax out  of the workbox saw his opportunity, seized the position  on the fork, went into my lord"s mouth, and when my  Jord"s teeth closed on him, never did wax hold so tight.

Lord Hemp was taken home in his great coach.  The widow"s woikbox was still on the seat, he opened  it and found it empty, though siill heavy, for it was  made of stout wood. When he dropped the lid, the box  itself started up and flew at his face, so that when he  got home his eyes were black and his nose was swollen  with the thrashing it had given him.</paragraph>

The seams refusing to  be ripped, he had to be peeled out of his white and blue  batin with a knife, in such a way that the whole suit  was destroyed.

I was not killed,  as you see, but, of course, I was much stunned, and lay  for a long time, I suppose. When I opened my eyes,  there was nothing to be seen more than a faint glimmer  from the daylight far above, and a great many dancing  stars which seemed like a swarm of gnats, ready to  settle on my body. I was thinking how I should find  rescue, when an odd matter got my attention.

The chaise contained a  gentleman and lady, with their goveniess, their maid,  and their six children. Franklin Bruce saw only the  face of a lovely girl, who had blossomed through ten  summers, as she stood up, crying wildly, " Wo, wo ! "* to  the horses. Never before had he seen such woe as was  depicted in her face ; never before had a vision of such  beauty crossed his path. At a glance he saw that the  horses were those of the Bugle, in the neighbouring  post-town, and that one of them was the vicious Bruiser,  whom the ostler had so often suffered him to ride. The  love of that horse for the merry boy had been the wonder  of the inn-yard; and now, even in his hurry, at the  sound of a cheery " Woa-ho " from Franklin, the horse  turned as to a dear friend whom it would be rude to  pass in the public road without a recognition. The first  pause was enough ; Franklin at once walked round the  animal, soothing and patting him. The peril was  averted ; the horse"s head was turned by its driver from  the abyss, over the brink of which it almost hung. And  when the chaise had been turned quietly back to the  high road, the gentleman said, " Eeceive, my boy, the  blessing of a grateful, father, and accept some token,  however inadequate, of my approval of your conduct.

It was her noon of glory to set a  hot dish in the middle of her table at the very moment  when the sun  that hot dish on which all the flowers  feast  stood in the middle of the day. For the sun to  stand still at noon would not have been more unnatiu"al  than for the potatoes in the pot of Mistress Peaflower to  need another minute"s boiling when the clock struck  twelve. Keeping hot is over-cooking. " Better," she  said, " let meat be cold than overcooked." Papilion,  her husband, was of the same mind ; and little Vetch,  her only daughter, being helpful to the mother in the  house, and being indeed the person who peeled the  potatoes, always was on the spot when she ought to be  eating. But of her one son, Trigonel, it was the single  fault that he was always behind time \p. coming to his  dinner.</paragraph>

She had come  to him in his childhood, when he rolled on his back  among the cowslips of the meadow. Then she appeared,  and always, like the sheen of a maiden in gold armour,  with long locks of golden hair. A plume like a flash of  light waved over the diamond helmet beneath which  glanced her blue eyes, more radiant than all. To other  sight than that of Tn"gonel she was a ray, and nothing  more. At mid-day, Papilion and Pea flower gave their  minds to their meat ; so that they did not see, as they  must have seen, had they but dined at half-past twelve  o"clock, the sunshine that at noon, even when all the  upper air was thick with fog and sleet, would glitter  daily for a little while about their boy.

Then the roar ceased, the  storm rolled back, and the great giant Time, with a face  high and hard as a mountain top, and with his beard  rolling like a cloud among the clouds, stood still over  Trigonel.

Always time for everything was on its way to become  no time for. anything with the most punctual of living  creatures  and how tired she was I Although the clock  took no note of her added work, she felt it in her bones.  The Fairy-sand gave time, not strength, beyond the com-  mon bounds. Then, too, if she was tired, how fagged  was Trigonel ! That young man, eager to earn for his  mother and sister silk attire, sometimes would make his  arms ache with twelve hours of chopping between  breakfast and dinner. And when he did come home to  dinner, very likely he would find his mother fast asleep  upon the floor. Always oppressed by fatigue, she was  apt to drop asleep suddenly and unexpectedly. Even  when she had in her hand the Fairy-sand, it would then  slip from her hold, and the hours of the day would march  in processson over her, till Trigonel came home and  woke her up.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1964'>Joe Bletch held the hammer for a carpenter in Sloley.  It was no part of his duty to use the hammer, or to hpld  the nails. The hammer was used by the master car-  penter, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='blow;penter;business;car;s;master;department;hammer' adjectives='ready;able' verbs='be;use;give;feel;rest;take;have;strike;hold' valence='5.73363636364' arousal='4.10454545455' dominance='5.22090909091'>Joe</entity>"s department in the business was to  take it from him whenever he had struck a blow ; to  hold it for him while he rested, and to be ready to give  it to him instantly when he felt able to strike again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1965'>The master carpenter was desperately busy. An easy-  chair had been commanded by his Majesty, and there  was much competition in the trade fur the production  of it; because it was announced that the first chair  brought to the palace would be bought, if it proved  comfortable. For the last twelve months all the master  carpenters and joiners in the kingdom had been toiling  eSrch at his own notion of an easy chair of state. But  nobody was ready yet. Joe"s master^ commonly called  Old Yesterday, was very forward with his work. This  man was called Yesterday, from a peculiarity he had of  making yesterday"s affairs the only subject of his con-  versation. Every day"s business, however little it might  interest him at the time, was .sure to receive from him  on the morrow most deliberate consideration. He  always veiy thoroughly knew what he was about, up to  the date of his last bed-time. In other words, being a  very prudent man, he never gave his mind to anything  till he had slept upon it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1966'>Old Yesterday was very forward with his work ; but  he had one great difficulty to contend with.

The carpenter was a marked  man, and a mined man, who should endeavour to improve  his work by opposition to the orders of the trade. The  public, indeed, suffered. It was certain, also, that the  Eoyal person of the King would suffer seriously if he  should now venture to sit upon the easy chair that was  being constructed for him by his faithful subject. The  legs and seat of the chair would tear and. v^ound the  corresponding parts of royalty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1970'>Joe Bletch was the most fidgetty apprentice in the  world. He stood in the dim workshop, with the hammer  in his hand, grasping it nervously, twisting it, brandish-  ing it behind his master"s back, tapping his toes on the  ground, and sometimes, when all the workmen happened  to be gc ne to sleep at the same moment, dancing furiously  with the hammer clenched in his hard fist. The light  in the workshop was subdued, according to the manner  of the country, for the better rest of the "workpeople.  Old Yesterday, when he had struck his blow, and re-  stored the hammer to Joe"s hand, commonly nursed his  strength with forty winks. The boy who turned the  gimlet had a right to a short nap after every twist  The man who planed wood had a right to sleep as often  as he dropped a shaving. A bright light in the work-  shop would make all such valuable snatches of repose  impossible for many. It is for this reason that in-door  work in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sunshine;glare;degree;nature;light;work;reason;fog' adjectives='in-door;possible' verbs='temper;be;obtain;do' valence='5.8175' arousal='3.9725' dominance='5.518125'>Dulmansland</entity> is done as nearly as possible by  the degree of light which we obtain in nature when the  glare of sunshine is beneficently tempered by a fog.</paragraph>

Only the boy who had  a hole to bore by dinner-time had wakened up to give a  fresh turn to his gimlet, and he did not lift up his eyes  high enough to see how Joe Bletch, who was never  asleep, wrestled behind his master. He was wrestling  with the hammer, that was pulling itself out of his hand.  For three years he had been grasping it nervously, pour-  ing into it through his fists an eager, straining desire to  rush forward, and thump furiously at all the nails in all  the boards in all the shops in all the world. During  this whole time, perhaps, he had been charging the  hammer, as one charges an electric jar, with a tremendous  power, and at last it was alive. It pricked up its two  ears, lifted its flattened nose, pulled fiercely to get its  tail out of Joe Blotch"s hand ; and, free at length, flew  at the nails in the chair to beat them. There was a  wild din of rapid hammering, that almost roused some  of the men. Old Yesterday opened his eyes, and stared  before him.</paragraph>

Joe, as he reached  the town gate, stood on one side for ten minutes, while  the Stilton mail, drawn by six round horses, came through.  It brought passengers from Stilton, the seat of govern-  ment or capital of Dulmansland, twenty miles distant from  Sloley. By this coach came also the Stilton newspapers  of the month before last, presently to be delivered at the  Sloley breakfast-tables.

Out of doora  there was nobody at work ; within the house, the whole  establishment was to be seen busy over a great pie. Joe  flew at the rough wood with his hammer, broke an^ tied  a pile of fagot-bundles, and then entering the kitchen,  pointed to the yard and said : " I have worked for yon,  now I am come to eat." All who were at table stared ;  but the brisk visitor took a plate for himself from the  dresser-shelf, borrowed the knife and foik which the  master of the house had laid down in astonishment,  cleared a place for himself opposite the pie, finished it,  and drank all that was left in the beer-jug.

He had been  occupied intensely with the study of that mysterious line  which, till this day, wit of man or fish never availed  to decipher, the line written in strange letters on the  Mackerel"s back. Clearly these are the varied letters of  some words of mystery. In a strange language writing  is traced on the back of the Mackerel, and it is even  underlined in evidence of its importance. Now, it hap-  pened that our Mackerel, who had been studying his own  back for a hundred years in a glass borrowed from a  Mermaid, read the first letter of the magic line at a time  when the revel of the Shark"s great fancy ball was  shaking all the water round his cave. And in the  moment when he knew what was the interpretation of  the first letter, his tail-fins grew into legs having feet  each with a thousand toes, and his gill-fins stretched  themselves into arms having hands each with a thousand  fingers. Music had been his sole refreshment in the  intervals of work. A good-natured Siren used to bring  her hai"p and sing with him. Sometimes when she  meant soon to come back, her harp had been left in a  comer of his cave, lliere it was, at that moment, readv  to be touched, and the exulting Mackerel, taking it  between his feet, swept his two thousand fingers through  its many strings. Then music, such as no ten-fingered  creature ever made, brought all the Sirens to his door.  A magnificent Cod-fish, rolling by on his way to the  fancy ball, pushed through the Sirens, and looking in  as he passed, said, " Not bad for a Mackerel !

Cirrha, the daughter of  the King, was to elect her future husband from a multi-  tude of suitors. Cirrha was a maiden, delicate and  pure, with a skin white as unfallen snow; but colder  than the snow her heart had seemed to all who sought  for her affections. When Cirrha floated gracefully and  slowly through her father"s hall, many a little cloud  would start up presently to tread where she had trodden.  The winds also pursued her; and even men looked forth  admiringly whenever she stepped forth into their sky.  To be sure, they called her Mackerel and Cat"s Tail,  just as they call her father Ball of Cotton ; for the race  of man is a coarse race, and calling bad names appears  to be a great part of its business here below. Before  the revels were concluded the King ordered a quiet  little wind to run among the guests, and bid them all  come close to him and to his daughter. Then he spoke  to them as follows :</paragraph>

When King Pipit  went to bed, his pillow was stuffed with those sounds^  that soothed him into easy slumber with assurance that  his enemies were safe. Pipit the Twenty-ninth-and-a-  third, like his royal predecessors, knew every captive  by the sound of his or of her footstep, by the rub of  the chain, or the tone of the cry of suffering, or nightly  prayer. He made sure that he had all his groans before  he slept in peace, counting them as a good monk might  count his beads. Whenever he missed the stir of any  one prisoner, he sent one of the gaolers, who served as  his grooms of the bed-chamber, to see that all was safe,  and to fetch out a groan in some way for his full and  perfect satisfaction.

When he went abroad, he travelled like a criminal with  shot chained to his leg, lest any sudden puff of wind  should carry him away. It was golden shot, exquisitel}"^  chased, inlaid with gems, and very costly. The Tsar"s  condition was a serious affair. Every right-minded  courtier was bound to keep his master in good counte-  nance by reducing his own bulk as much as possible.  The more a man rose in the State, the less he might eat.  Gruel and vinegar was all the diet of a goldstick or a  premier. Fetters became, of course, a part of every  courtier"s dress. Those gentlemen who were so con-  stituted that they could not help becoming fat, even  upon vinegar and gruel, carried about costly balls chained  to their legs, as if they also dreaded eddies of the wind.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2848'>But this part of the fashion was no matter of com-  plaint. Gentlemen gladly rivalled one another in the  costliness of their leg-chains, or the weight and enrich-  ment of their golden balls. Persons of the middle class  in Teshu tied silver-gilt shot to their ankles. Lower  down the social scale, copper-gilt and paste diamonds  were in request. There was only the confessed beggar  who did not at least wear lacquer. There was no dis-  satisfaction felt, then, about the ballast added to the  leg ; but there was serious objection to the loss of  ballast from the person. The gruel and vinegar diet,  the compelled abstinence from soup and beer, and other  solaces of life, did not sit easily upon the stomach of the  nation.</paragraph>

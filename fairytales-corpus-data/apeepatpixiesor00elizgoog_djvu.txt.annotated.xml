	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>In a work of mine, addressed in a series of letters to the late lamented poet  Xiaareatc, Robert Southey, entitled " The Borders of the Tamar and the  Tavy," I gave an account of many of our local superstitions, and related  several legends and traditions, peculiar to this delightful county: among  them were a few Pixy stories. These had the good fortune to meet with  favor both from critic and reader; and confirmed the opinion I had pre-  viously formed concerning the general interest attached to Pixy lore.</paragraph>

And when they pass on in. a more quiet  way, the water is so clear you may see every stone beneath  it; and several of the rocks standing in the middle or at  the sides of these streams^ are often quite covered with  moss and what is called lichens. These are of various  colours; white, green, grey, or of the deepest black, like a  piece of rich black velvet. And it is very pretty, too,  here to see the water- wagtail, a nice little bird with white  and grey feathers, skimming over the rocks, shaking his  tail up and down, dipping his wings into the stream and  off again in a moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>On Dartmoor, too, as I have noticed in a previous work,*  we meet in spring, upon a sunny morning, the pale yellow but-  terfly, usually seen in the garden among the flower beds; but  here sporting on the front of some old grey rock, or settling  on the wild thyme, or on the golden furze, as its wings shake  with a quickness that will sometimes dazzle the sight.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>But though there are so many pleasant sights, yet the  moor has its dangers. Those very high hills and lofty  tors are liable to be visited with sudden mists which ar^  as thick as the clouds; and so hide every thing, that I have  known persons when seated in a carriage and caught in one  of these say, that they could not plainly see the heads of  the horses which drew them along. It is sad to think how  many poor people in old times before the good broad road  was made, lost their lives on the moor in these mists; some  by wandering about all night in the cold, and others  by getting into bogs and being swallowed up alive before  help could be given them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>u"Many years ago, a very remarkable instance occurred of a  native of this place, the late Mr. Edward Smith, being  enveloped in a mist, whilst endeavouring to make his way  (from a stream where he had been fishing) across Mistor,  with a view to shorten his road to Princetown on the moor.  The following particulars I have gathered and selected  from Mr. Smith"s own account of the circumstance.^ "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>u"He had not advanced more tlian a quarter of a mile in  liis ascent, when he ^s so suddenly enveloped in a cloud,  dense, dark, and flaky, that it startled him. On every  side appeared whirling masses of mist, of so thick a con"  fiistency that it affected his very breathing. He paused ;  but thinking it would be impossible to err in walking in  a straight line over the summit of a hill, continued to  advance ; but in this he was deceived. The way seemed to  lengthen before him. At last he descried a few of those  immense fragments of granite with which the summit of  the tor was strewed. Their appearance through the fog  was wonderfully grand, wavy, fantastic, and as if possessing  life. Although even with the surface, such was the decep-  tion, they appeared upright, each in succession perpen-  dicular, imtil he arrived so close, that it required almost the  very touch to prove the deception. There were also some  scattered sheep, one here and there. At the distance of  twenty or thirty yards, for he could distinguish nothing  further, they had the appearance of a moving unshapen  mass, infinitely larger than reality. Every now and then  one of these animals would start from the side of a block of  granite close to his feet, affrighted  sometimes with a scream-  ing bleat, as if, like himself, filled with surprise and awe. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>When, as he believed, he had gained the summit,  Mr. Smith stood still and looked about him. There was  above, beneath, and all around, a mass, flaky, and at  times even rushing, of white fog. At length he sat down  to rest, feeling unable to walk on. His situation was now  painful, and the evening rapidly approaching.. The fog</paragraph>

He looked around for some large frag-  ments of stone, under the shelter of which to take up his  quarters for the night. From exertion he had been hot  even to excess, but was now shivering and chilled* At  length he endeavoured to proceed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>The ground began to incline, and he suddenly found  himself descending a very steep acclivity; presently he  heard the distant rushing of water ; the sound enlivened him ;  it was like the voice of a guide and friend, and he pressed  onward; when suddenly, qq instantaneously that he could  compare it to nothing but the lifting up of a veil, the fog  rushed from him, and the scene which opened induced him  almost to doubt his very senses.</paragraph>

At his right, within two or three hundred yards,  was the very spot he had first quitted to ascend the moun-  tain, and in front arose one of those grand and lofty tors  which render the moor so striking; it was dark and frown-  ing, its topmost ridges embosomed in clouds, whose summits  were gilded by the broad sun, now rapidly descending  behind them. The whole scene was like magic; even  whilst looking on it, it appeared to him as a dream. He  now found that, during a space of two hours and a half,  he had walked up the mountain, taken a complete circuit "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>In the winter months, the snow often entirely covers the  moor, and so suddenly and heavily will a snow-storm come  on, that travellers have not unfrequently been confined to  the house in which they had the good luck to take shelter  before it arose, for many days and weeks together. At  various times, many a poor creature has been frozen to  death on the moor. An instance that happened many  years ago, was truly melancholy. A shepherd who had so  perished was not found till some weeks after his death,  when his dog, nearly starved, was discovered wistfully  watching near the body of his unfortunate master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>At a later period, two boys were sent from a neighbouring  farm to look for some strayed sheep on the moor. They  were surprised by a sudden storm of snow; and not return-?  ing their master grew uneasy, and with some of his men  went out to search for them. The lads were found nearly  buried in snow, and both apparently sleeping. In this  state they were removed to the farm-house; one was  restored to life, but the other was quite dead.*</paragraph>

"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>You have read, my young friends, in your History of Eng-  land, some accounts of the ancient Britons, and of the  Druids, who were priests and judges among them. The  Druids lived very much together, and formed schools, in  which they taught such arts and learning as they were  acquainted with; and they studied much the stars on heights  and open places, such as those on Dartmoor, where a great  many of them dwelt. They said it was unlawful to perform  the rites and ceremonies of their religion within a covered temr  pie or under a roof of any kind. Whenever they could, there-  fore, they chose a hill or lofty mound for the purpose, as from  such they could have a better view of the sun, and the moon,  and the planets, which they were so ignopant as to worship.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='115'>Now these temples they made by setting upright in the  earth large, rough, unhewn stones in the form of a circle;  and many such are still to be seen on Dartmoor. Sometimes  when they found a very large rock of a strange and unusual</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='120'>Many of the Britons lived in huts on Dartmoor, and these  were made, like the temples, by rough hewn stones set  upright in the ground, in the form of a circle, with walls  made of wood and roofs of rushes, high and tapering like  tents. There are, also, still to be seen, here and there, a  circle of very strong stones, so large as to have within  its enclosure a great many small huts ; and the sheep and  the cattle used to be driven within it at night, to save them  from being devoured by bears and wolves, which in those  days prowled about the moor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>When the Dartmoor Britons buried a chief, who was  always a warrior or a king, the Druids raised a heap of  stones over his grave; and sometimes a very large single  piece of granite, supported upon three or four upright  stones, as we see the legs support an old fashioned table;  and this they called a Cromlech.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>Now this wild tract of land, as well as other parts of  Devonshire and Cornwall, is considered to be haimted by a  set of little creatures, called Pixies. They are not like  children; for, though they are small, and can sometimes  be seen, it is said they can fly as well as run, and creep  through key-holes, and get into the bells of flowers, and  many other places where little boys and girls cannot creep.  The Pixies are sometimes good, and do kind acts; but  more frequently they are mischievous, and do a great deal  of harm to men, women, and children, if they have a spite  against them ; and often hurt the cattle</paragraph>

They are, however, generally considered a  distinct race ; for if you could but see a Pixy, my young  friends, you would see at once how different was such a  creature from a Fairy. Indeed, it is matter of tradition,  that the Faries wished very much to establish themselves  in Devonshire, but the Pixies would not hear of it ; and a  terrible war ensued. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='host;wound;leg;none;herb;dominion;effect;principal;secretary' adjectives='majesty;incurable;least;beneficial' verbs='be;defeat;receive;prove;have;have'>Oberon</entity> was, with his host, defeated ;  and his majesty received a wound in the leg which proved  incurable ; none of the herbs in his dominions have hitherto  had the least beneficial effects, though his principal secretary "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='132'>These tiny elves are said to delight in solitary places, tO:  love pleasant hills and pathless woods, or to disport them-  selves on the margins of rivers and mountain streams. Of  all their amusements dancing forms their chief delight;  and this exercise they are said always to practise, like the  Druids of old, in a circle or ring. These dainty beings,  though represented as of exceeding beauty in their higher  order, are nevertheless^ in some instances, of strange, un-  couth, and fantastic figure and visage ; though such natural  deformity need give them very little uneasiness, since they  are traditionally believed to possess the power of assuming  various shapes at will.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='133'>Their love of dancing is not unaccompanied with that of  music, though it is often of a nature somewhat different to.  those sounds which human ears are apt to consider harmo-  nious.

This is dug out and smelted with  fire, so as to free it from the dross mixed with it, and then  it becomes a valuable metal ; and the copper-smith works  it into many useful things for household and other purposes.  A pit, or hole, is made in the earth, and sometimes a mine  is found and worked several hundred feet below the surface ;  and men are let down into it with buckets, not unlike  those used at a well. Water is always found in mines ;  very large machines, therefore, are erected, by which it is  constantly pumped up, or the men would be drowned  whilst digging out the copper ore. As the light of day  cannot penetrate thus deep in the earthy the miners used  candles in lanterns ; but, in our days, more frequently the  safety lamp invented by Sir Humphrey Davy. Boys are  much wanted in mines, to do many slight matters of work ;  such as to wheel small quantities of the ore in barrows to  the heap, whence the men remove the load above ground*  They are sometimes also employed to pick and wash the  copper, so as to firee it from the loose earth with which it is  mixed.

The  70cks beneath run out into the sea in the most &amp;ntastic  shapes, and the waves, which break against them in sheets  of foam, produce a very beautifiil effect. Few of the walk  and towers of this castle now remain ; and they are so old  and so weather-beaten that, in colour and in form, they  differ very little &amp;om the rocks themselves. In the cliffi  are two deep caverns ; one of these the sea has completely  penetrated through, and so much have the cli&amp; &amp;llen by  the continual rush of the waters, that it is only by crossing  a narrow slip of land, or isthmus, that the summit, where  tiie ruins now principally stand, can be reached^ and that  not without difficulty and danger*</paragraph>

Then men clad in armour  kept watch and ward upon the battlements, to see that no  enemy, either by land or by water, might approach un-  suspected the dwelling of old Sir Rowland, the Baron bf  Tiutagel. He was famous for his hospitality, and for his  courage in battle, and, for his love of mirth and min-  strelsy, was commonly called Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hospitality;courage;battle;love;mirth;strelsy;sir;merry' adjectives='famous' verbs='be;be;call;brave'>Rowland</entity>, the merry and  brave.</paragraph>

His small legs and thighs were  covered all over with hair; his tail, though short, was more  bushy than that of little Lynx, and he had the wings of a  bat, both on his shoulders and at his heels. No sooner had  be appeared than he alighted at once on the broomstick of  the witch ; catching hold of it by his tiny fat fingers, and  whirled himself round, and round, and round it, in his  Pixy fun, so that it dazzled WilFs eyes only to see it.</paragraph>

Joan ordered him to leave off his antics and to do  her bidding. Whereupon Crabby Cross made a spring and  seated himself at once upon her shoulder, and received in a  whisper her commands. He gave three tumbles, head over  heals, in token of obedience; and immediately after popped  through the key-hole, followed by his train of attendant  Pixies.</paragraph>

He had served for many years under the late  King Henry the Sixth, and (though it was never proved  against him) was strongly suspected, on account of his  hard-heartedness, of having been chosen as one of the  murderers who assisted in smothering the poor little princeS  in the Tower.</paragraph>

But as her husband took with him all the little  she had gained in money by working hard to help her  neighbours, and even deprived her of what wheat she had  stored up by gleaning in the fields, she was very poor and  needy. The last time he went away was to fight in Bos-  worth Field; and then he left her with only seven eggs in  the world to live upon; and these she had concealed in an  old, cracked oaken bowl that stood in a dark place in the  comer cupboard.

Suddenly she heard a moaning without^  accompanied by a gentle tapping at her door. Bridget rose  up in haste, for she fancied this must be the cry of some  benighted traveller; and so kind was her heart that distress  never cried to her in vain, for if she had but a crust of  bread, she would gladly share it with any poor soul who  had none.

But the most strange  thing of all was that there was a look of a woman in the  child\"s face, which Bridget did not know very well how to  describe when she told the story: so she used to say  "it  was for all the world like a little old child, neither one thing  nor the other, and yet for all that very pretty." As to the  wet rags and the hair, she did not know what to think of  them either, for though she wiped down the creature\"s locks  with the tail of her own petticoat, as hard as a groom  wipes down a horse after a heat, and got all the wet from  its head, yet the tail of the petticoat remained bone dry,  and looked cleaner and better than when it was new ; and  when she took the urchin to the fire in her dripping clothes,  they dried in a trice, but never once smoked !</paragraph>

They generally contented themselves, if  they lived in the country, with riding about hunting and  hawking on their own lands. There were, also, no news-  papers in those days; so that, what with the want of such  .coaches and rail-roads, and newspapers, news of any kind  travelled slowly ; and an event which was very stirring in  one village might not be known in the next for some days,  or even weeks, aflr.

Now there  was, among them, a very noble residence, which had been  built early in the twelfth century. It stood on the north  side of the market-town of Tiverton ; and to this day,  though but a portion of its ruins are in existence, it forms  an object of curiosity with the traveller and the antiquary.  The ruins consist of a large gateway and some strong towers  and walls, partially overgrown with ivy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='509'>Just before the opening of my tale, the Countess had  been much annoyed by a law-suit, commenced against her-  self and her little son by the wicked Baron La Zouch^ who  set up a most unjust claim to Tiverton Castle, pretending  he had a right to the lands on which it stood. But, after  a great deal of time and money spent to no purpose, he lost  his suit, and the Countess remained in full possession of the  castle.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='609'>I will not detain you, my young friends, with a relation  of all the particulars of the siege. It was a very stirring  one whilst it lasted. So many men were collected in the  surrounding woods, that there was scarcely a branch of a  tree, but a nodding plume, or a helmet, or the glitter of a  steel cap was seen under it. There was a fierce contest  in the efibrt made by the besiegers to storm the outward  barriers and to gain access to the castle by crossing the  moat or ditch by which it was surrounded. "When that  ^as gained by the enemy, there was such a blowing of  bugles and soimding of trumpets, and whizzing of arrows,  and twanging of crossbows; such a rolling down of stones  and hot pitch from the battlements of the castle on the  besiegers, and such a shouting and a calling and a banging  "With swords and axes about each other\"s heads; and such a  clashing of shields, that never was anything like it since  men began to kill each other for gain, or for amusement,  in battles or in tournaments.

So wicked was he, that he  offered among the worst of his own people a reward in  gold to any one of them who would kill the Countess,  either openly or by any secret means he could devise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='614'>La Zouch was a violent man, but even in his own wicked  plans incautious; so that the plots he was desirous to carry  into execution against her life reached the ears of the  Countess.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='619'>u"About midnight, the Countess was awakened by a strange  sound without the window. The raoon shone brightly, for  it was at the full, and streamed into the apartment in a  flood of light, when she fancied she saw a small creature  like a child in form, but not so high as her hand, pulling  the ears of the little dog which the Princess Picket had  given to Patience, and which, by that affectionate girl^s  wish, the Countess had taken to sleep in her bed-chamber  ever since she had been frightened about the Baron. She  now looked and wondered, and fancied that she must be  dreaming. The dog growled on having his ears pulled,  but did not raise up his nose, which, was turned towards  his hind legs, as he lay in a manner rolled up on the rushes  near the bed-side. But before the lady could satisfy her-  self if she were waking or sleeping, she heard a noise at the  window, and, on looking up, saw, to her astonishment, a  man squeezing himself through it, and getting into her  room. The moon gleamed partially upon him, and showed  that he wore a steel casque or cap: something glittered that  he carried in. his hand.  " At that moment, before the Countess could spring from  fcer bed, the dog roused up, and barked so furiously, that  tiie man, who had cleared the window and leaped down on  the floor, first made at the dog with the intent to silence it.  But though he struck at it again and again, the little crea-  ture ran round and round and. round him in so quick a "</paragraph>

She told him he was  too young and too slight to encounter the armed man, but-  bade him run and sound the alarm-bell that was near her  chamber, and do all he could to rouse the castle, and call-  up the guard, who, night and day, were on the watch at the .  castle gates.</paragraph>

At  length the Countess was much relieved by hearing that the  Baron la Zouch was absent from the country, and had taken  with him all his men, except a few that he left to guard his  own castle which was far distant from hers. She now  thought herself safe for a time; and as she had been very  much confined within her own walls, she began to wish for  firesh air. A ride in the forest was proposed. After con-  sulting with the priest and the captain of the guard, they  gave it as their opinion that the safest way would be for the  Countess and one of her daughters to dress themselves very  plainly, like their waiting damsels; and so to go out together  without any attendance, as if they were merely two of the  household going on their own affairs to the neighbouring  market; whereas did so great a lady go forth with her  accustomed state it might attract notice, and some new plan  be devised for her. injury.</paragraph>

Part L  DUEING the latter part of the turbulent reign of John,  king of England, Sir Roger de Stevenson became the  guardian, appointed by that sovereign, of the young Henry  de Bath, the orphan heir of the honourable house of  Bathon, OjiBath; whose principal residence, at that time,  was Bath Hall, in the parish of North Tawton, Devonshire.  On the estate, and within sight of the mansion, was a large  circular pool, not very deep, but of such exceedingly pure  water, issuing from some spring in the earth, that it was  considered to possess a coolness, freshness, and an invigo-  rating quality unequalled even in that county where rocky  rivers, streams, and wells of every description are found in  such abundance. It was said to be favoured and protected  by the Pixies ; who, according to tradition and the current  opinion, delighted to sport on its margin, to sail on its tiny  waves by moonlight (for Pixies are great lovers of moon-  shine), and above all to make it their bath.

The old, the feeble, or the  very poor, who lived principally, if not entirely, by begging  an alms at the doors of the monasteries, and of the rich,  would hasten on their way, when within a mile of the spot, "</paragraph>

In order to accommodate these poor people  an iron cup, secured by a chain, had been fixed to a stone  seat on the margin of the bath; and this little act of charity  had often brought a blessing from the lips of the weary  and the traveller, on the kind hand that had bestowed it,  as they drew a refreshing draught from the spring.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='730'>During the minority of Henry de Bath, his guardian  lived with him. Sir Roger de Stevenson was proud,  covetous, churlish. He liked not to have his purse drawn  upon, nor his pride and grandeur disturbed by the solicita-  tions or the presence of the lame, the old and the ragged.  With great cruelty, therefore, did he order the iron cup to  be removed, thinking by so doing to hinder poor folk from  obtaining water from the pool. But, strange to say, though  this was twice done, the cup was found, each time, restored  to its former place the next morning.

As she began to ascend the high ground  beyond it, she slackened her pace^ and looked back upon  Tintagel^ which now opened with all its grandeur of castle  and cliff upon the view. She had never so attentively ob-  served it as on this day; and, she could not tell why, but  "she then gazed upon it with a melancholy interest. "</paragraph>

Serena now, therefore, looked upon it in its  sombre hue with a secret sense of dread. Nor was it with-  out a shudder that as she turned to continue her walk she  saw a solitary magpie pacing up and down on the very road  she had to cross. She did not like the evil sign, and she  thought that she would take a shorter way, and find out  that the country people sometimes took in going to chapel. "</paragraph>

She could hear the running  of water, and soon came in aght of a stream tliat ran  rapidly under a vast number of trees. This she crossed  and still advanced. She now perceived some overhanging  rocks, and on the hill above these stood the little chapel.  She had not advanced very far, when she heard the vesper  bell.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='930'>But at that very moment she heard strains of the most  enchanting music. Nothing earthly seemed to mingle with  those sounds. " Serena ! Serena, quickly turn, hark to  the vesper bell." She fencied that a voice above the rocks  spoke these words. But, alas I she neglected the friendly-  warning. She looked this way, that way, up the ravine,  among the trees, and could see no one; whilst every step  she advanced, the music of the unseen musician appeared  to move on before her. ** I will but tarry a few minutes  to see who it is plays thus sweetly, and where the sounds  come from," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sound;chapel;yonder;bell;ringing' adjectives='' verbs='tarry;see;be;play;come;say;reach;have;do'>Serena</entity>, "I shall yet reach the chapel  yonder, before the bell has done ringing."</paragraph>

Alas! it was of more power  than the call of duty over her wavering mind.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='936'>The music now seemed to come from the opposite side  of the stream ; and so much was her curiosity excited, that  she took the resolution to try to cross it, and to find out  the unseen minstrel.

Serena was light of foot and very  active; and so by marking well where to venture, and  springing from rock to rock, she managed to get over the  stream. Again did she enter on a narrow path, and fol-  lowed it for a few yards, when, on a sudden turn, she came  in sight of the loveliest waterfall that she had ever beheld.</paragraph>

A few  yards distant from the fall, there stood fronting it some  rocks, which half way up had the appearance of a natural  arch; and through this opening the foaming waters were</paragraph>

The vesper bell was forgotten ;  and to think from what a cause! Serena had given  herself up to the influence of a vain curiosity !

Then, urchins though they were, they  threw him down in a minute; all hands set to work and  fairly skinned him, being careful in so doing not to break  the hide. Whilst this operation was going on, another  party of these diminutive monsters . (if so they may be called)  busied themselves in bringing in great logs of wood. It  was truly wonderful to see such little creatures capable, by  their numbers, of removing such loads. The logs were  disposed upon the hearth. One of the Pixies then breathed  upon them, and immediately they kindled into a flame.</paragraph>

The pitchforks stopped of them-  selves, and then the urchins dismounted ; and one putting  his fork into the nose of the poor ox, whilst the other did  the same to his rump, and the third poked at his side, they  had him up in a trice, and contrived to suspend him ready  for roasting before the fire. And then they all set to and  whirled and turned him backwards and forwards and round  about like so many mad turnspits, and basted him with the  cook"s ladle and with all the butter and cream that they  could steal from the dairy; for Pixies are very good cooks,  and know that meat is never delicate or tender unless basted  with care. The roasting was soon finished ; for a fire "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1071'>And then, exactly while the old farmer in his hiding hole  could count seven, three times was the ox lifted up and  three times again let down, before it was transferred to the  large kitchen table. This done, one little wretch, &amp;r more  ugly than all the rest, with something bright and sparkling  about his brows (the form of which the &amp;rmer could not  exactly make out), stamped with his tiny feet, and bade the  whole band to the feast. In another moment, out flew a  thousand little knives, each in shape resembling a cutlass,  and each Pixy fell to *\" tooth and nail," on the good cheer,  cutting and carving and helping himself. They all seemed  highly to enjoy their supper, and chatted and talked as &amp;st  as they ate in a sort of squeak very like the squeak of mice  in a comer. These little wretches contrived in a few  minutes, to devour fat and lean, and every part of the ox  except the brain, the eyes, and bones and sinews. The  bones, however, were picked quite clean, and looked to the  wondering farmer, to be as white as drifted snow. They  were then cast under the table.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1072'>But how the old man did tremble and quake with fear  when he saw that one of the small bones of the beast had  fallen near the entrance of the hole in the wall, where he  lay concealed. He had, however, courage and presence of  mind sufficient to stretch out his hand and catch up this  small bone. He then shut to the little softly-sliding panel  that formed a sort of door to the entrance of his secret  retreat; for he was so overcome with terror that he could  not bear any longer to behold such a scene of mischieft</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1076'>Presently he perceived tjie Pixy company set to dancing  and capering like mad things ; and this they did in a ring^  holding each other by the hand, and making a humming  Boise like a tune (though a very wild and strange one) which  was only interrupted by the mouselike squeak and a sort of  chuckling, for that was thdr manner of mirth and laughter.  After they were pretty well tired with their sports, the little  Pixy who looked more old and ugly than all the rest, gave  a sharp shrill cry, and immediately all the party began to  collect the scattered bones, and to put them together with  wonderful ease and precision, fastening them with ligatures  and sinews. The little creatures, however, in building up  the ox, missed the small bone, and appeared greatly alarmed  lest it should bring upon them the anger of their king.  But after consulting together, they seemed to form a plan  to conceal it from him pretty readily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1077'>They next laid out the skeleton of the ox, as clean and  as perfect as if they had been doing it to oblige any Surgeon  Hunter, or Professor Owen, for their schools of anatomy.  They then took the horns and the hoofs (which they  removed before supper) with very great care ; and, lastly,  drew the skin over the bones with admirable dexterity. It  went on without pulling, for there was no flesh left to  create the slightest difficulty.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1082'>All these rites being accomplished, the leader among the  Pixies took several pieces of birch from a broom in the  kitchen, and, making one after his own fashion, proceeded  to rub down the ox, from the tip of his nose to the end of  his tail. Whereupon the animal began slowly to re-ani-  mate. First he opened one eye, and then another ; shook  his ears, and rolled out his tongue ; and then he gave such  a sudden whisk with his tail, that he tumbled off from  it a dozen or two of Pixies who were amusing themselves  by hanging upon it, as ship-boys do upon a rope ; and,  lastly, he gave such a bellow, that it even startled the  old farmer in his hole. Their sport for the night being  accomplished, and fearing the ox, with his bellowing^  would disturb the house, the Pixy tribe proceeded to  drive the poor beast towards the door; but they could  not do even this like other creatures, for they did it by  teazing and pinching him in a very wanton manner.  And then it was found, that, for want of the small mis-  sing bone, the animal limped terribly, and went lame  on one leg. They all, however, got out, much in the  same way that they got in.

As soon as  all was quiet, lie crept out of his smuggling-hole, and went  to bed, terribly frightened ; but could not get a wink of  sleep all the night for thinking of the Pixies. As soon  as it was day, he got up, and went straight to the ox-  house ; and there he found his poor skeleton beast, halting  on one leg. Now, there was a strange kind of old woman  lived near him, who was called old Joan, the witch ; but,  though he consulted her upon the case, it seemed that  she could do nothing for him, but rather inclined to  favour the Pixies ; very probably they were her personal  friends. However, being hard pressed to give advice,  she told the farmer to go to a conjuror, known by the  name of the White Wizard of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='advice;farmer;conjuror;name;white;wizard;man;power;witch;pixie;devil;kind;degree' adjectives='hard;little;short;funny;old;formidable;little' verbs='be;press;give;tell;go;know;be;choose;use'>Exeter</entity> ; a little, short,  funny old man, who was very formidable when he chose  to use his power over witches and pixies, and little devils  of all kinds and degrees.</paragraph>

How he took down the  tower of the Pixy church, and broke it up for stones  for his building, and every thing which had befallen  him ; and all that he had both seen and heard with his  own eyes and ears. The White Wizard thought the  affair a very bad one ; but not altogether hopeless. He  counselled the farmer to go home, pull down his new  building, carry back all the stones to where he had taken  them from, put them down on the same spot, but not  to attempt to do anything more to them. Although  grieved, and vexed to think he must be at so great a  loss as all this implied, yet the old man obeyed. Great</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>In a work of mine, addressed in a series of letters to the late lamented poet  Xiaareatc, Robert Southey, entitled " The Borders of the Tamar and the  Tavy," I gave an account of many of our local superstitions, and related  several legends and traditions, peculiar to this delightful county: among  them were a few Pixy stories. These had the good fortune to meet with  favor both from critic and reader; and confirmed the opinion I had pre-  viously formed concerning the general interest attached to Pixy lore.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>But though there are so many pleasant sights, yet the  moor has its dangers. Those very high hills and lofty  tors are liable to be visited with sudden mists which ar^  as thick as the clouds; and so hide every thing, that I have  known persons when seated in a carriage and caught in one  of these say, that they could not plainly see the heads of  the horses which drew them along. It is sad to think how  many poor people in old times before the good broad road  was made, lost their lives on the moor in these mists; some  by wandering about all night in the cold, and others  by getting into bogs and being swallowed up alive before  help could be given them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>Many years ago, a very remarkable instance occurred of a  native of this place, the late Mr. Edward Smith, being  enveloped in a mist, whilst endeavouring to make his way  (from a stream where he had been fishing) across Mistor,  with a view to shorten his road to Princetown on the moor.  The following particulars I have gathered and selected  from Mr. Smith"s own account of the circumstance.^</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>He had not advanced more tlian a quarter of a mile in  liis ascent, when he ^s so suddenly enveloped in a cloud,  dense, dark, and flaky, that it startled him. On every  side appeared whirling masses of mist, of so thick a con"  fiistency that it affected his very breathing. He paused ;  but thinking it would be impossible to err in walking in  a straight line over the summit of a hill, continued to  advance ; but in this he was deceived. The way seemed to  lengthen before him. At last he descried a few of those  immense fragments of granite with which the summit of  the tor was strewed. Their appearance through the fog  was wonderfully grand, wavy, fantastic, and as if possessing  life. Although even with the surface, such was the decep-  tion, they appeared upright, each in succession perpen-  dicular, imtil he arrived so close, that it required almost the  very touch to prove the deception. There were also some  scattered sheep, one here and there. At the distance of  twenty or thirty yards, for he could distinguish nothing  further, they had the appearance of a moving unshapen  mass, infinitely larger than reality. Every now and then  one of these animals would start from the side of a block of  granite close to his feet, affrighted  sometimes with a scream-  ing bleat, as if, like himself, filled with surprise and awe.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>When, as he believed, he had gained the summit,  Mr. Smith stood still and looked about him. There was  above, beneath, and all around, a mass, flaky, and at  times even rushing, of white fog. At length he sat down  to rest, feeling unable to walk on. His situation was now  painful, and the evening rapidly approaching.. The fog</paragraph>

He looked around for some large frag-  ments of stone, under the shelter of which to take up his  quarters for the night. From exertion he had been hot  even to excess, but was now shivering and chilled* At  length he endeavoured to proceed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>The ground began to incline, and he suddenly found  himself descending a very steep acclivity; presently he  heard the distant rushing of water ; the sound enlivened him ;  it was like the voice of a guide and friend, and he pressed  onward; when suddenly, qq instantaneously that he could  compare it to nothing but the lifting up of a veil, the fog  rushed from him, and the scene which opened induced him  almost to doubt his very senses.</paragraph>

At his right, within two or three hundred yards,  was the very spot he had first quitted to ascend the moun-  tain, and in front arose one of those grand and lofty tors  which render the moor so striking; it was dark and frown-  ing, its topmost ridges embosomed in clouds, whose summits  were gilded by the broad sun, now rapidly descending  behind them. The whole scene was like magic; even  whilst looking on it, it appeared to him as a dream.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>In the winter months, the snow often entirely covers the  moor, and so suddenly and heavily will a snow-storm come  on, that travellers have not unfrequently been confined to  the house in which they had the good luck to take shelter  before it arose, for many days and weeks together. At  various times, many a poor creature has been frozen to  death on the moor. An instance that happened many  years ago, was truly melancholy. A shepherd who had so  perished was not found till some weeks after his death,  when his dog, nearly starved, was discovered wistfully  watching near the body of his unfortunate master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>At a later period, two boys were sent from a neighbouring  farm to look for some strayed sheep on the moor. They  were surprised by a sudden storm of snow; and not return-?  ing their master grew uneasy, and with some of his men  went out to search for them. The lads were found nearly  buried in snow, and both apparently sleeping. In this  state they were removed to the farm-house; one was  restored to life, but the other was quite dead.*</paragraph>

The  Druids lived very much together, and formed schools, in  which they taught such arts and learning as they were  acquainted with; and they studied much the stars on heights  and open places, such as those on Dartmoor, where a great  many of them dwelt. They said it was unlawful to perform  the rites and ceremonies of their religion within a covered temr  pie or under a roof of any kind. Whenever they could, there-  fore, they chose a hill or lofty mound for the purpose, as from  such they could have a better view of the sun, and the moon,  and the planets, which they were so ignopant as to worship.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>Now this wild tract of land, as well as other parts of  Devonshire and Cornwall, is considered to be haimted by a  set of little creatures, called Pixies. They are not like  children; for, though they are small, and can sometimes  be seen, it is said they can fly as well as run, and creep  through key-holes, and get into the bells of flowers, and  many other places where little boys and girls cannot creep.  The Pixies are sometimes good, and do kind acts; but  more frequently they are mischievous, and do a great deal  of harm to men, women, and children, if they have a spite  against them ; and often hurt the cattle</paragraph>

They are, however, generally considered a  distinct race ; for if you could but see a Pixy, my young  friends, you would see at once how different was such a  creature from a Fairy. Indeed, it is matter of tradition,  that the Faries wished very much to establish themselves  in Devonshire, but the Pixies would not hear of it ; and a  terrible war ensued. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='none;leg;herb;wound;effect;host;dominion;secretary;principal' adjectives='beneficial;incurable;least;majesty' verbs='receive;be;prove;have;defeat' valence='5.325' arousal='4.05277777778' dominance='5.36666666667'>Oberon</entity> was, with his host, defeated ;  and his majesty received a wound in the leg which proved  incurable ; none of the herbs in his dominions have hitherto  had the least beneficial effects, though his principal secretary</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='132'>These tiny elves are said to delight in solitary places, tO:  love pleasant hills and pathless woods, or to disport them-  selves on the margins of rivers and mountain streams. Of  all their amusements dancing forms their chief delight;  and this exercise they are said always to practise, like the  Druids of old, in a circle or ring. These dainty beings,  though represented as of exceeding beauty in their higher  order, are nevertheless^ in some instances, of strange, un-  couth, and fantastic figure and visage ; though such natural  deformity need give them very little uneasiness, since they  are traditionally believed to possess the power of assuming  various shapes at will.</paragraph>

But Gammer  Guy would interfere; and as Sir Simon de Noodle was, in  respect to knowledge of the law, quite as much an old  woman as herself, he did not check her. So she persuaded  the friends of the dead to drop prosecution for witchcraft  and murder solely on the accused subscribing to the follow-  ing conditions of ordeal : namely, that Betsy Humming  should spin one hundred and forty threads (that being the  number in agreement with the years of the deceased) , and  spin them so fine, that they should all pass through, and  remain in the eye of Trim Trickett"s needle with which he  usually worked in his shop. But unless this were done by  the expiration of one month, and if they eventually failed  in such object, then they should both be put upon their trial  for witchcraft and murder. The ordeal was a severe one;  and the luckless spinster and tailor looked at each other  aghast with affright. But Betsy had a stout heart, far  stouter than the tailor; and so, raising her hand after a  minute"s pause, she gave Trim an encouraging slap on the  back, exclaiming, " Never start from the trial, man ! never  fear. We have done no wrong ; let us do right still ; and  trust the rest to all the good saints in the calendar.

Master constable bowed  profoundly to this command; and a bag was ordered to  convey pussy out of the court to the safe keeping of the  law officer.

This is dug out and smelted with  fire, so as to free it from the dross mixed with it, and then  it becomes a valuable metal ; and the copper-smith works  it into many useful things for household and other purposes.  A pit, or hole, is made in the earth, and sometimes a mine  is found and worked several hundred feet below the surface ;  and men are let down into it with buckets, not unlike  those used at a well. Water is always found in mines ;  very large machines, therefore, are erected, by which it is  constantly pumped up, or the men would be drowned  whilst digging out the copper ore. As the light of day  cannot penetrate thus deep in the earthy the miners used  candles in lanterns ; but, in our days, more frequently the  safety lamp invented by Sir Humphrey Davy. Boys are  much wanted in mines, to do many slight matters of work ;  such as to wheel small quantities of the ore in barrows to  the heap, whence the men remove the load above ground*  They are sometimes also employed to pick and wash the  copper, so as to firee it from the loose earth with which it is  mixed.

As to the  wet rags and the hair, she did not know what to think of  them either, for though she wiped down the creature"s locks  with the tail of her own petticoat, as hard as a groom  wipes down a horse after a heat, and got all the wet from  its head, yet the tail of the petticoat remained bone dry,  and looked cleaner and better than when it was new ; and  when she took the urchin to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='rag;horse;head;urchin;lock;groom;petticoat;tail;hair;s;trice;clothes;heat;bone;creature' adjectives='dry;cleaner;own;hard;better;wet;new' verbs='dry;do;look;get;drip;think;remain;know;smoke;be;wipe;take' valence='5.42275' arousal='4.13725' dominance='5.43675'>the fire</entity> in her dripping clothes,  they dried in a trice, but never once smoked !</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='619'>About midnight, the Countess was awakened by a strange  sound without the window. The raoon shone brightly, for  it was at the full, and streamed into the apartment in a  flood of light, when she fancied she saw a small creature  like a child in form, but not so high as her hand, pulling  the ears of the little dog which the Princess Picket had  given to Patience, and which, by that affectionate girl^s  wish, the Countess had taken to sleep in her bed-chamber  ever since she had been frightened about the Baron. She  now looked and wondered, and fancied that she must be  dreaming. The dog growled on having his ears pulled,  but did not raise up his nose, which, was turned towards  his hind legs, as he lay in a manner rolled up on the rushes  near the bed-side. But before the lady could satisfy her-  self if she were waking or sleeping, she heard a noise at the  window, and, on looking up, saw, to her astonishment, a  man squeezing himself through it, and getting into her  room. The moon gleamed partially upon him, and showed  that he wore a steel casque or cap: something glittered that  he carried in. his hand.  " At that moment, before the Countess could spring from  fcer bed, the dog roused up, and barked so furiously, that  tiie man, who had cleared the window and leaped down on  the floor, first made at the dog with the intent to silence it.  But though he struck at it again and again, the little crea-  ture ran round and round and. round him in so quick a</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='623'>In the interval, the Countess leaped firom her bed, and-  rushing towards that side of the room where her zealous ^  little guard still fought so bravely for her defence, she-  slipped under the arras or tapestry that hung loose over the  walls, opened a secret door which it concealed, and in  another moment called up the page. She told him he was  too young and too slight to encounter the armed man, but-  bade him run and sound the alarm-bell that was near her  chamber, and do all he could to rouse the castle, and call-  up the guard, who, night and day, were on the watch at the .  castle gates.</paragraph>

At  length the Countess was much relieved by hearing that the  Baron la Zouch was absent from the country, and had taken  with him all his men, except a few that he left to guard his  own castle which was far distant from hers. She now  thought herself safe for a time; and as she had been very  much confined within her own walls, she began to wish for  firesh air. A ride in the forest was proposed. After con-  sulting with the priest and the captain of the guard, they  gave it as their opinion that the safest way would be for the  Countess and one of her daughters to dress themselves very  plainly, like their waiting damsels; and so to go out together  without any attendance, as if they were merely two of the  household going on their own affairs to the neighbouring  market; whereas did so great a lady go forth with her  accustomed state it might attract notice, and some new plan  be devised for her. injury.</paragraph>

Part L  DUEING the latter part of the turbulent reign of John,  king of England, Sir Roger de Stevenson became the  guardian, appointed by that sovereign, of the young Henry  de Bath, the orphan heir of the honourable house of  Bathon, OjiBath; whose principal residence, at that time,  was Bath Hall, in the parish of North Tawton, Devonshire.  On the estate, and within sight of the mansion, was a large  circular pool, not very deep, but of such exceedingly pure  water, issuing from some spring in the earth, that it was  considered to possess a coolness, freshness, and an invigo-  rating quality unequalled even in that county where rocky  rivers, streams, and wells of every description are found in  such abundance. It was said to be favoured and protected  by the Pixies ; who, according to tradition and the current  opinion, delighted to sport on its margin, to sail on its tiny  waves by moonlight (for Pixies are great lovers of moon-  shine), and above all to make it their bath.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='726'>Whether Pixies delighted in it or not, the poor certainly  did so; and when the labourers were toiling in the fields  during the harvest either for hay or com, and got heated  under a scorching sun, they would gladly come and slake  their thirst at the Pixies" bath.

He liked not to have his purse drawn  upon, nor his pride and grandeur disturbed by the solicita-  tions or the presence of the lame, the old and the ragged.  With great cruelty, therefore, did he order the iron cup to  be removed, thinking by so doing to hinder poor folk from  obtaining water from the pool. But, strange to say, though  this was twice done, the cup was found, each time, restored  to its former place the next morning. Sir Roger was very  angry, and though the servants, one and all, protested that  they had nothing to do with it, yet he would insist it was  their act and deed in opposition to his will. Accordingly  he employed one or two of his own sturdy followers to  remove the cup, and took it into his own possession, locked  it up in his strong oak chest, and put the key in his pocket.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='924'>Serena took leave of her aged counsellor with repeated  promises to mind what she said. She passed the castle  gates in a somewhat hurried manner, for fear of meeting  Father Hilary, as she liked not to be lectured by him on  her way. With a quick step did she also pass the village  of Trevenna. As she began to ascend the high ground  beyond it, she slackened her pace^ and looked back upon  Tintagel^ which now opened with all its grandeur of castle  and cliff upon the view. She had never so attentively ob-  served it as on this day; and, she could not tell why, but  "she then gazed upon it with a melancholy interest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='925'>It was indeed a fine sight, and whilst the walls and towers  of her father"s ancient dwelling were lit up with a flood of  light, the rock called Long Island, was in complete gloom  from the overshadowing clouds. This rock wild, lofty, broken^  close in shore, though surrounded by the waves, was said  to be peopled, and especially after nightfall, by sea-gulls  and spirits. Serena now, therefore, looked upon it in its  sombre hue with a secret sense of dread. Nor was it with-  out a shudder that as she turned to continue her walk she  saw a solitary magpie pacing up and down on the very road  she had to cross. She did not like the evil sign, and she  thought that she would take a shorter way, and find out  that <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='chapel;people;way;sign' adjectives='shorter;evil' verbs='do;like;think;take;go;find' valence='5.664' arousal='4.01' dominance='5.354'>the country</entity> people sometimes took in going to chapel.</paragraph>

She could hear the running  of water, and soon came in aght of a stream tliat ran  rapidly under a vast number of trees. This she crossed  and still advanced. She now perceived some overhanging  rocks, and on the hill above these stood the little chapel.  She had not advanced very far, when she heard the vesper  bell. Mindful of her promise she determined to retrace  her steps as speedily^ as possible, and no longer linger^  though in so lovely a scene.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='930'>But at that very moment she heard strains of the most  enchanting music. Nothing earthly seemed to mingle with  those sounds. " Serena ! Serena, quickly turn, hark to  the vesper bell." She fencied that a voice above the rocks  spoke these words. But, alas I she neglected the friendly-  warning. She looked this way, that way, up the ravine,  among the trees, and could see no one; whilst every step  she advanced, the music of the unseen musician appeared  to move on before her. ** I will but tarry a few minutes  to see who it is plays thus sweetly, and where the sounds  come from," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sound;bell;yonder;ringing;chapel' adjectives='' verbs='be;play;do;tarry;reach;say;see;have;come' valence='5.76388888889' arousal='3.84722222222' dominance='5.56'>Serena</entity>, "I shall yet reach the chapel  yonder, before the bell has done ringing."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='935'>Again did Serena listen, and still could she hear, even  above the sounds of the rushing waters, the vesper-bell.  She now in good earnest determined to turn back. But at  that moment, such a strain of sweetness arose; it caught  Iter ear, and she became once more fixed by the spell of  sach enchanting harmony. Alas! it was of more power  than the call of duty over her wavering mind.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='936'>The music now seemed to come from the opposite side  of the stream ; and so much was her curiosity excited, that  she took the resolution to try to cross it, and to find out  the unseen minstrel. She looked round and perceived  some large loose stones, which served, though not without  risk, for stepping-stones. Serena was light of foot and very  active; and so by marking well where to venture, and  springing from rock to rock, she managed to get over the  stream. Again did she enter on a narrow path, and fol-  lowed it for a few yards, when, on a sudden turn, she came  in sight of the loveliest waterfall that she had ever beheld.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='937'>It was situated at the extremity of a recess among the  wildest rocks. These formed so complete an inclosure, that  it was only in front facing the fall that a view of it could  be gained. The cascade itself was not lofty, not above fifty  or sixty feet in height; it was its form and accompaniments  which rendered it of such surpassing loveliness. A few  yards distant from the fall, there stood fronting it some  rocks, which half way up had the appearance of a natural  arch; and through this opening the foaming waters were</paragraph>

Thence they rushed on in the wildest  tumult over vast masses of granite, which lay in the bed of  the stream as if to impede its course. Here and there,  occasioned by the hollows beneath, might be found a calm  deep pool, undisturbed by the impetuosity of the flood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='941'>Serena stopped, delighted with the beauty of the scene.  " This is the sweetest ravine in the world," she said; " such  a beautiful waterfall, and the rocks so wild and broken;  and all shut in to keep it, as it were, from the approach of  common mortals. Surely this must be the very place in  which my nurse tells me, that Merlin of old, the great  magician, in the days of Prince Arthur, used to work his  spells; where the Pixies make their fiivourite haunt, and  where they are now most powerfiil, and, therefore, most to  be feared.

She paused a moment; her eyes became as much fascinated  by the beautiful appearance of the sleeping figure, as her  ears had before been charmed by the mysterious music.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='959'>It was a strange place for repose. The sleeper was a  young man, of a very good person, and handsome features,  with light brown curly hair. His attire was at once rich  and elegant. He wore such a cloak and vest as Serena  had never before seen; the plumage of the finest birds  seemed to have been rifled to give it splendour. And  then the cap on his head, and the tiara which was bound  around his brows, was so radiant and glittering with jewels,  that they looked as if diamonds, and emeralds, and rubies^  and sapphires had been clustered together so as to emulate  in the manner of their arrangement the colours of the  butterfly"s wing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='960'>Serena gazed till her admiration of the manly beauty and  splendid attire of the youthful sleeper became as great as  that which she had felt, a little while before, for the music;  and far exceeded her admiration of the beauties of the scene.  She thought that, if ever she married, it should be to just  such a beautiful youth; and then his dress was so graceful^  so rich ; and as for his tiara, it would be the prettiest thing  imaginable to have just such another to bind around her  own dark and flowing hair. She felt quite sure none but a  prince could altogether be so charmingly dressed, and so  handsome ; and he it must be who had produced from that  lute such exquisite tones.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='963'>Serena was now in no hurry to pass on, but looked about  her, and seeing an opening in some rocks near at hand, that  were overshadowed by thick and pendant boughs, she de-  termined to conceal herself and to survey more at her  leisure the noble features and the splendid adornments of  the sleeper; hoping that, when he awoke, he would again  touch the strings of his lute. The vesper bell was forgotten ;  and to think from what a cause! Serena had given  herself up to the influence of a vain curiosity ! Soon had  she cause to rue her folly; for most sadly was she beguiled  by what could be nothing more than an illusion to ensnare  and deceive her; the work of an enemy to her peace.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='964'>After a while, a thick mist suddenly fell like a cloud over  every object around her. The very rocks and trees which  sheltered her were no longer visible. The wind moaned,  and the river rushed along in tumult as the roar of the  waterfall became loud as rolling thunder. Serena trembled  in every limb; her heart beat quick; she knew not what to  do. Move from the spot of her concealment she dared not ;  she was on the verge of despair, when gradually the mist  rose like a veil that had been thrown over the landscape,  and now raised by an invisible hand. The rocks, woods,  and waterfall once more were distinctly seen, but under a  melancholy aspect; no sun-beam fell upon them; all was  shadow and gloom. She looked down on the narrow  pathway; but neither the beautiful sleeping youth, nor the  lute by his side were to be seen; they were gone; and she  saw only the broken and mossy rocks wet with the spray  and foam of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foam;side;youth;spray;lute;rock;pathway' adjectives='beautiful;broken;mossy;narrow;wet' verbs='go;be;see;sleep;look' valence='5.762' arousal='4.0065' dominance='5.4315'>the stream</entity> I</paragraph>

Lastly, as what she had to do must be performed  at the Kieve, and in sight of the waterfall, at the full of the  moon, he offered to accompany her to the- spot.

No one knew where it had a nest.  It was popularly believed to be the spirit of the great  enchanter. Merlin, thus inhabiting the body of a bird for  a certain term of years. Merlin, it was said, had been a  cruel enemy to the Pixies. Serena was directed to watch ;  and when she saw something dark come sailing over the  rocks above, on out-spread wings, and with loud screams  prepare to dash itself into the midst of the fall, then was  she to address it in a form of words, which the wizard  instructed her how to repeat.

After they were pretty well tired with their sports, the little  Pixy who looked more old and ugly than all the rest, gave  a sharp shrill cry, and immediately all the party began to  collect the scattered bones, and to put them together with  wonderful ease and precision, fastening them with ligatures  and sinews. The little creatures, however, in building up  the ox, missed the small bone, and appeared greatly alarmed  lest it should bring upon them the anger of their king.

I know not if it  is still in being, as great havoc of late years has taken place on the  moor ; many rocks have been blasted with gunpowder, broken up  for the roads, and otherwise destroyed. But the Church Rock was  long remembered ; and many old persons have declared, that they  could recollect the time when, if you placed your ear close to it on  a Sunday, you could hear a low tinkling sound like the bells of  Tavistock Church, and always at the time of warning for service;  and they also said, that the chimes, at the regular hours of the day  for chiming, could be so heard at the rock. All this was duly  ascribed to the Pixies, who, it was believed, loved bell-ringing, and  went to church. Hence the rock in question received the name of  the Pixies^ Church.

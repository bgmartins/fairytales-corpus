	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='244'>Blondine slept calmly all night; no ferocious beast came to trouble her slumbers. She did not suffer from the cold and awakened at a late hour in the morning.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='279'>The table was served by gazelles who were marvellously adroit. They waited, carved and even divined the wishes of Blondine, Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='286'>Blondine slept profoundly, and on awaking she found herself entirely changed. Indeed, it seemed to her she could not be the same person. She was much taller, her intellect was developed, her knowledge enlarged. She remembered a number of books she thought she had read during her sleep. She was sure she had been writing, drawing, singing and playing on the piano and harp.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='287'>She looked around, however, and knew that <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='same' verbs='be;look;sleep;know;have;conduct;go' valence='6.01666666667' arousal='3.79444444444' dominance='5.65'>the chamber</entity> was the same to which <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='same' verbs='be;look;sleep;know;have;conduct;go' valence='6.01666666667' arousal='3.79444444444' dominance='5.65'>Bonne-Biche</entity> had conducted her and in which she had gone to sleep.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='291'>"Yes, my dear Blondine, you are fourteen years old to-day. But you have slept peacefully seven years. My son Beau-Minon and I wished to spare you the weariness of all early studies. When you first entered the castle you knew nothing; not even how to read. I put you to sleep for seven years, and Beau-Minon and I have passed this time in instructing you during your sleep. I see by the wonder expressed in your eyes, sweet princess, that you doubt all this. Come into your study and reassure yourself on this point."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='292'>Blondine followed Bonne-Biche to the little room. She ran first to the piano, commenced playing and found that she played remarkably well. She then tried the harp and drew from it the most ravishing sounds, and she sang enchantingly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='293'>She took her pencil and brushes and drew and painted with a facility which denoted a true talent. She wrote and found her handwriting clear and elegant.

The queen, Fourbette, entered and related to him that notwithstanding the remonstrances of Gourmandinet, Blondine had herself seized the reins and guided the ostriches who becoming frightened dashed off in the direction of the Forest of Lilacs and overturned the carriage. Blondine was thrown over the grating which bounded the forest. She stated that Gourmandinet had become insane from terror and grief and she had sent him home to his parents. The king was in wild despair at this news. He ran to the Forest of Lilacs and he had to be withheld by force from throwing himself across the boundary in order to search for his cherished Blondine. They carried him to the palace where he yielded to the most frightful sorrow and despair, calling unceasingly upon his dear Blondine, his beloved child. At last, overcome by grief, he slept and saw in a dream Blondine in the castle of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='childhood;assurance' adjectives='sweet;calm;happy' verbs='be;restore;give' valence='6.73909090909' arousal='3.65636363636' dominance='6.07'>Bonne-Biche</entity> gave him the sweet assurance that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='childhood;assurance' adjectives='sweet;calm;happy' verbs='be;restore;give' valence='6.73909090909' arousal='3.65636363636' dominance='6.07'>Blondine</entity> should one day be restored to him and that her childhood should be calm and happy.</paragraph>

All the world supposed you to be dead. As to your sister Brunette, she became so wicked, so insupportable, that the king hastened to give her in marriage last year to the prince Violent, who charged himself with the duty of reforming the character of the cruel and envious princess Brunette.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='306'>The days passed away quietly and pleasantly. Blondine was much occupied, but was sometimes melancholy.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='755'>Rosette entered her ugly garret and saw before her a magnificent box of rosewood, wide open. She undressed and as she removed her articles of clothing they arranged themselves in the box, which then closed firmly. She arranged her hair and dressed herself with her usual neatness and then ran to the glass. She could not suppress a cry of admiration.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='756'>Her robe was of gauze and was so fine and light, and brilliant it looked as if woven of the wings of butterflies. It was studded with diamonds as brilliant as stars. The hem of this robe, the corsage and the waist were trimmed with diamond fringe which sparkled like suns. Her hair was partly covered with a net of diamonds from which a tassel of immense diamonds fell to her shoulders. Every diamond was as large as a pear and was worth a kingdom. Her necklace and bracelets were so immense and so brilliant that you could not look at them fixedly without being blinded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='757'>The young princess thanked her godmother most tenderly and felt again upon her fair cheek the sweet kiss of the morning.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='759'>Rosette was indeed sad to find herself the object of hatred to her father, mother and sisters. Charmant perceived her melancholy and asked the cause. She explained it to him frankly.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='763'>After dinner the king gave orders for the ball to commence.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='764'>The modest Rosette hesitated and drew back because it was repugnant to her to show herself in public and attract the general regard. But the more she declined, the more her envious sisters insisted, hoping that she would at last suffer a real humiliation.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='765'>The queen now interfered and sternly commanded Rosette to dance. Rosette rose at once to obey the queen. Charmant, seeing her embarrassment, said to her in low tones:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='768'>And now Rosette and Charmant commenced. A more animated, graceful and light dance was never seen. All present gazed at them with ever increasing admiration. Rosette was so superior in dancing to Orangine and Roussette, that they could scarcely suppress their rage.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='771'>Orangine and Roussette could no longer control themselves. They were suffocating with rage, fainted and were carried from the room. They had become so marked by the passions of envy and rage that they had lost every vestige of beauty and no one had any sympathy for them, as all had seen their jealousy and wickedness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='772'>The applause and enthusiasm for Rosette and Charmant were so overpowering that they sought refuge in the garden. They walked side by side during the rest of the evening, and talked merrily and happily over their plans for the future, if the fairy Puissante would permit them to unite the smooth current of their lives. The diamonds of Rosette sparkled with such brilliancy that the alleys where they walked and the little groves where they seated themselves, seemed illuminated by a thousand stars. At last it was necessary to separate.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='781'>While Rosette was thus sleeping peacefully, the king, the queen, and Orangine and Roussette, purple with rage, were quarrelling and disputing amongst themselves. Each was accusing the other of having brought about the triumph of Rosette and their own humiliating defeat. One last hope remained for them. In the morning there was to be a chariot race. Each chariot was to be drawn by two horses and driven by a lady. It was resolved to give <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;chariot' adjectives='high;wild;untrained' verbs='be;draw;resolve;prance;give' valence='5.92166666667' arousal='4.20583333333' dominance='5.69083333333'>Rosette</entity> a very high chariot, drawn by two wild, untrained and prancing horses.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='783'>The consoling thought that Rosette might be killed or grievously wounded and disfigured on the morrow brought peace to these four wicked beings.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='784'>Rosette, who had a tranquil conscience and contented heart, slept all night calmly. She had been much fatigued and did not wake till a late hour. Indeed, on rising she found she had scarcely time to dress. The coarse kitchen girl brought her a cup of milk and a piece of bread. This was by order of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='servant;order' adjectives='' verbs='be;direct;treat' valence='5.97' arousal='4.17333333333' dominance='5.84777777778'>the queen</entity> who directed that she should be treated like a servant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='785'>Rosette was not difficult to please. She ate the coarse bread and milk with appetite and began to dress. The case of carved ivory had disappeared.

On her neck was a chain of sapphires, at the end of which was a watch, the face of which was opal, the back a carved sapphire and the glass diamond. This watch was always going, was never out of order and never required to be wound up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='787'>Rosette heard her page at the door and followed him. On entering the salon she perceived Prince Charmant, who was awaiting her with the most lively impatience. He sprang forward to receive her, offered his arm and said with eagerness:--</paragraph>

Unfortunately I forgot to invoke the fairy Detestable, who was already irritated against me for having married a princess, after having refused one of her daughters. She was so exasperated against me that she swore an implacable hatred against me, my wife and my children.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='934'>Saying these words, she seized the hem of Rosalie"s dress with her sharp little teeth and tried to draw her away. Rosalie uttered a piercing cry and clung convulsively to her father but an irresistible force bore her off.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='936'>The mouse pulled Rosalie without ceasing. Her arms were still clasped around her father, striving to resist the overpowering force of her enemy. The mouse uttered a discordant little cry and suddenly the house was in flames.

Whereas, if she preserved her own life there remained always some chance of rescuing him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='943'>Weeping bitterly, Rosalie continued her journey, and wherever she presented herself they refused to receive her and the mouse, who never quitted her side. She entered a forest where happily she found a brook at which she quenched her thirst. She found also fruits and nuts in abundance.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='944'>While Rosalie was thus musing she kept her eyes closed so as not to see the wicked little gray mouse. Her fatigue, and the silence and darkness around her, brought on sleep and she slept a long time profoundly.</paragraph>

Suddenly the dogs ceased barking and grouped themselves silently around Rosalie. The prince dismounted from his horse to set the dogs again upon the trail of the deer but what was his surprise to see a lovely young girl asleep in this lonely forest! He looked carefully around but saw no one else. She was indeed alone--abandoned. On examining her more closely, he saw traces of tears upon her cheeks and indeed they were still escaping slowly from her closed eyelids.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='948'>Rosalie was simply clothed but the richness of her silk dress denoted wealth.

He suffered no one to touch her but carried her himself to her chamber and laid her gently upon the bed, ordering the women who were to wait upon and watch over her to apprise him as soon as she awaked.

Your father will soon be restored to you and we will celebrate our happy marriage."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='969'>Rosalie thanked her young and handsome cousin heartily and then returned to her chamber, where she found her maids awaiting her with a wonderful selection of rich and splendid robes and head-dresses. Rosalie, who had never given much attention to her toilet, took the first dress that was presented to her. It was of rose-colored gauze, ornamented with fine lace with a head-dress of lace and moss rosebuds. Her beautiful chestnut hair was arranged in bands, forming a crown. When her toilet was completed, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='toilet;breakfast' adjectives='' verbs='be;come;complete;conduct' valence='5.72428571429' arousal='3.98' dominance='6.04571428571'>the prince</entity> came to conduct her to breakfast.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='970'>Rosalie ate like a person who had not dined the day before. After the repast, the prince led her to the garden and conducted her to the green-houses, which were very magnificent. At the end of one of the hot-houses there was a little rotunda, ornamented with choice flowers; in the centre of this rotunda there was a large case which seemed to contain a tree but a thick heavy cloth was thrown over it and tightly sewed together.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='980'>These last words made Rosalie tremble, for they recalled to her the little gray mouse and the misfortunes which menaced her as well as her father, if she allowed herself to fall under the temptation, which, without doubt, her enemy the fairy Detestable had placed before her. She spoke no more of the mysterious case, and continued her walk with the prince. The day passed most agreeably. The prince presented her to the ladies of his court and commanded them to honor and respect in her the princess Rosalie, whom the queen of the fairies had selected as his bride. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='queen;idea' adjectives='lovely;amiable;charming' verbs='be;rejoice;have' valence='6.514' arousal='4.169' dominance='6.108'>Rosalie</entity> was very amiable to every one and they all rejoiced in the idea of having so charming and lovely a queen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='981'>The following days were passed in every species of festivity. The prince and Rosalie both saw with joyous hearts the approach of the birth-day which was to be also that of their marriage:--the prince, because he tenderly loved his cousin, and Rosalie because she loved the prince, because she desired strongly to see her father again, and also because she hoped to see what the case in the rotunda contained. She thought of this incessantly. She dreamed of it during the night and whenever she was alone she could with difficulty restrain herself from rushing to the green-house to try to discover the secret.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='982'>Finally, the last day of anticipation and anxiety arrived. In the morning Rosalie would be fifteen. The prince was much occupied with the preparations for his marriage; it was to be a very grand affair. All the good fairies of his acquaintance were to be present as well as the queen of the fairies. Rosalie found herself alone in the morning and she resolved to take a walk. While musing upon the happiness of the morrow, she involuntarily approached the green-house. She entered, smiling pensively, and found herself face to face with the cloth which covered the treasure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='983'>"To-morrow," said she, "I shall at last know what this thick cloth conceals from me. If I wished, indeed I might see it to-day, for I plainly perceive some little openings in which I might insert my fingers and by enlarging just a little----. In fact, who would ever know it? I would sew the cloth after having taken a glimpse. Since to-morrow is so near, when I am to see all, I may as well take a glance to-day."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='985'>She passed her fingers through the little apertures and strained them lightly. The cloth was rent from the top to the bottom with a noise like thunder and Rosalie saw before her eyes a tree of marvellous beauty, with a coral trunk and leaves of emeralds. The seeming fruits which covered the tree were of precious stones of all colors--diamonds, sapphires, pearls, rubies, opals, topazes, all as large as the fruits they were intended to represent and of such brilliancy that Rosalie was completely dazzled by them. But scarcely had she seen this rare and unparalleled tree, when a noise louder than the first drew her from her ecstasy. She felt herself lifted up and transported to a vast plain, from which she saw the palace of the king falling in ruins and heard the most frightful cries of terror and suffering issue from its walls. Soon Rosalie saw the prince himself creep from the ruins bleeding and his clothing almost torn from him. He advanced towards her and said sadly:--</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='986'>"Rosalie! ungrateful Rosalie! see what you have done to me, not only to me, but to my whole court. After what you have done, I do not doubt that you will yield a third time to your curiosity; that you will complete my misfortunes, those of your unhappy father and your own. Adieu, Rosalie, adieu!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1056'>Three months after the appearance of the toad and the cruel sentence of the fairy Furious, Agnella gave birth to a boy whom she named Ourson, as the fairy Drolette had commanded. Neither Agnella nor Passerose could decide if he was ugly or handsome for he was so hairy, so covered with long brown bristles, you could see nothing but his eyes and his mouth, and not even these unless he opened them.</paragraph>

He had nothing of the bear but his skin: he was the sweetest-tempered, the most knowing, the most affectionate child that ever was seen. Passerose soon loved him with all her heart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1066'>As Ourson grew up he was sometimes permitted to leave the farm. He was in no danger for no one knew him in the country. The children always ran away at his approach and the women repulsed him. Men avoided him--they looked upon him as something accursed. Sometimes when Agnella went to market she put him on her donkey and took him with her and on those days she found more difficulty in selling her vegetables and cheese. The mothers fled from her, fearing that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mother' adjectives='' verbs='come;fear;flee' valence='5.17' arousal='4.64' dominance='5.262'>Ourson</entity> would come too near them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1067'>Agnella wept often and vainly implored the fairy Drolette. Whenever a lark flew near her, hope was born in her breast. But the larks, alas, were real larks, fit only to make pies and not fairies in disguise.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1070'>Ourson at eight years of age was tall and strong, with magnificent eyes and a sweet voice; his bristles were no longer stiff but his hair was soft as silk, and those who loved him could embrace him without being scratched, as Passerose had been the day of his birth. Ourson loved his mother tenderly and Passerose almost as well but he was often alone and very sad. He saw too well the horror he inspired and he saw also that he was unlike other children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1071'>One day he was walking along a beautiful road which bordered on the farm. He had walked a long time and overcome with heat and fatigue he looked about him for some fresh and quiet spot for repose when he thought he saw a little object, fair and rosy, a few steps from him. Drawing near with precaution he saw a little girl asleep. She seemed to be about three years old and she was beautiful as the Loves and Graces. Her blonde hair partly covered her fair and dimpled shoulders while her soft cheeks were round and fresh and dimpled and a half smile played upon her rosy and parted lips, through which small teeth, white and even as pearls, could be seen. Her charming head was reposing upon a lovely rounded arm and the little hand was beautifully formed and white as snow. The attitude of this little girl was so graceful, so enchanting, that Ourson stood before her immovable with admiration. He watched with as much surprise as pleasure, this child sleeping as soundly and peacefully in the wood as if she had been at home in her own little bed. Ourson looked at her a long time and examined her toilet which was more rich and elegant than anything he had ever seen. Her dress was of white silk embroidered in gold; her boots were of blue satin also embroidered in gold; her stockings were silk and fine as a spider"s web; magnificent bracelets were sparkling upon her arms and the clasp seemed to contain her portrait; a string of beautiful pearls encircled her throat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1072'>A lark now commenced its song just above the lovely little girl and awakened her from her profound slumber.

At midday Passerose hung on Violette"s arm a basket containing wine, bread, a little pot of butter, some ham and some cherries. Violette set off eagerly. The morning had appeared to her very long and she was impatient to be again with Ourson.

He seemed greatly enraged, ploughed the ground with his tusks and rubbed the bark from the trees as he passed along. His heavy snorting and breathing were as distinctly heard as his step. Violette did not know where to fly or to hide herself. While she was hesitating the wild boar came in sight, saw her, and paused. His eyes were flaming, his whole body bristling, his tusks clashing together. He uttered a ferocious grunt, and sprang towards Violette. Happily she was near a tree whose branches were within her reach. She seized one, sprang up with it, and climbed from branch to branch, until she knew she was beyond his reach. Scarcely was she in safety when the savage animal precipitated himself with all his weight against the tree in which she had taken refuge. Furious at this obstacle, he commenced tearing the bark from the tree and gave it such furious blows with his snout that Violette was terribly frightened. The concussion caused by these violent and repeated blows might at last cause the fall of the tree.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1361'>Agnella, Violette and Passerose walked slowly towards the burned walls of the farmhouse. With the courage of despair they removed the smoking ruins. They worked diligently two days before this work was completed. No vestige of poor Ourson appeared and yet they had removed piece by piece, handful by handful, all that covered the site. On removing the last half-burned planks, Violette perceived an aperture, which she quickly enlarged. It was the orifice of a well. Her heart beat violently--a vague hope inspired it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1362'>"Ourson!" cried she, with a faint voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1363'>"Violette! dear Violette! I am here; I am saved!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1364'>Violette could reply only by a smothered cry; she lost her consciousness and fell into the well which enclosed her dear Ourson. If the good fairy Drolette had not watched over her fall, she would have broken her head and limbs against the sides of the well. But their kind protectress, who had already rendered them so many services, sustained her and she fell safely at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foot;kind;s;service;protectress' adjectives='many' verbs='sustain;render;have;fall' valence='5.5725' arousal='3.695' dominance='5.66'>Ourson</entity>"s feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1365'>Violette soon returned to consciousness. Their happiness was too great to be believed in--to be trusted. They did not cease to give the most tender assurances of affection. And now they were aroused from their ecstasy by the cries of Passerose, who, losing sight of Violette and seeking her amongst the ruins, discovered the open well. Peering into the darkness she saw Violette"s white robe and she imagined that the poor girl had thrown herself intentionally into the well and there found the death she sought. Passerose screamed loud enough to destroy her lungs. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='alarm;cause' adjectives='' verbs='come;know' valence='5.365' arousal='4.285' dominance='5.8675'>Agnella</entity> came slowly forward to know the cause of this alarm.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1368'>Agnella, pale, and half dead with emotion, listened to Passerose without comprehending her. She fell on her knees and had not strength to rise. But when she heard the voice of her dear Ourson calling to her: "Mother, mother, your poor son Ourson still lives!" she sprang toward <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='passerose;arm' adjectives='back' verbs='spring;draw;seize;have;precipitate' valence='5.68' arousal='3.755' dominance='5.75875'>the well</entity>, and would have precipitated herself within, had not Passerose seized her by the arms and drawn her back suddenly.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1371'>Passerose was absent a long time which was excusable as she was somewhat confused. First she seized a cord, then a pitchfork, then a chair.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1385'>Violette on her part comprehended better than Ourson why the next return of the fairy would be painful to him. Since Agnella had revealed to her in confidence the nature of the sacrifice that she could impose upon herself, she was resolved to accomplish it, in spite of the opposition of Ourson.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1389'>After having seen Violette in safety, Ourson sprang from the well and threw himself into his mother"s arms.

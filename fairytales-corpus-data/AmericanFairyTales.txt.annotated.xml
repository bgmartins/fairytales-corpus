	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='10'>No one intended to leave Martha alone that afternoon, but it happened that everyone was called away, for one reason or another. Mrs. McFarland was attending the weekly card party held by the Women"s Anti-Gambling League. Sister Nell"s young man had called quite unexpectedly to take her for a long drive. Papa was at the office, as usual. It was Mary Ann"s day out. As for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='girl;nature' adjectives='little;restless' verbs='look;have;stay' valence='5.957' arousal='4.037' dominance='5.424'>Emeline</entity>, she certainly should have stayed in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='girl;nature' adjectives='little;restless' verbs='look;have;stay' valence='5.957' arousal='4.037' dominance='5.424'>the house</entity> and looked after the little girl; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='girl;nature' adjectives='little;restless' verbs='look;have;stay' valence='5.957' arousal='4.037' dominance='5.424'>Emeline</entity> had a restless nature.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='11'>"Would you mind, miss, if I just crossed the alley to speak a word to Mrs. Carleton"s girl?" she asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.95' arousal='3.48' dominance='6.29'>Martha</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='12'>""Course not," replied the child. "You"d better lock the back door, though, and take the key, for I shall be upstairs."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='13'>"Oh, I"ll do that, of course, miss," said the delighted maid, and ran away to spend the afternoon with her friend, leaving <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='maid;house;ll;bargain;course;friend' adjectives='big;delighted' verbs='do;run;lock;leave;say;miss;spend' valence='5.805' arousal='4.245' dominance='5.7075'>Martha</entity> quite alone in the big house, and locked in, into the bargain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='14'>The little girl read a few pages in her new book, sewed a few stitches in her embroidery and started to "play visiting" with her four favorite dolls. Then she remembered that in the attic was a doll"s playhouse that hadn"t been used for months, so she decided she would dust it and put it in order.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='15'>Filled with this idea, the girl climbed the winding stairs to the big room under the roof. It was well lighted by three dormer windows and was warm and pleasant. Around the walls were rows of boxes and trunks, piles of old carpeting, pieces of damaged furniture, bundles of discarded clothing and other odds and ends of more or less value. Every well-regulated house has an attic of this sort, so I need not describe it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='16'>The doll"s house had been moved, but after a search <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='search;doll;house;s;corner;chimney' adjectives='big' verbs='be;move;find;have' valence='5.57153846154' arousal='3.93692307692' dominance='5.41'>Martha</entity> found it away over in a corner near the big chimney.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='17'>She drew it out and noticed that behind it was a black wooden chest which Uncle Walter had sent over from Italy years and years ago--before Martha was born, in fact. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hunt;hunter;uncle;key;elephant;home' adjectives='unopened;mighty' verbs='be;return;wish;wander;remain;hear;have;go;tell' valence='6.05416666667' arousal='3.8175' dominance='5.67458333333'>Mamma</entity> had told her about it one day; how there was no key to it, because Uncle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hunt;hunter;uncle;key;elephant;home' adjectives='unopened;mighty' verbs='be;return;wish;wander;remain;hear;have;go;tell' valence='6.05416666667' arousal='3.8175' dominance='5.67458333333'>Walter</entity> wished it to remain unopened until he returned home; and how this wandering uncle, who was a mighty hunter, had gone into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hunt;hunter;uncle;key;elephant;home' adjectives='unopened;mighty' verbs='be;return;wish;wander;remain;hear;have;go;tell' valence='6.05416666667' arousal='3.8175' dominance='5.67458333333'>Africa</entity> to hunt elephants and had never been heard from afterwards.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='18'>The little girl looked at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='girl;accident;attention' adjectives='little' verbs='attract;look;have' valence='5.7075' arousal='4.49875' dominance='5.4625'>the chest</entity> curiously, now that it had by accident attracted her attention.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='19'>It was quite big--bigger even than mamma"s traveling trunk--and was studded all over with tarnished brassheaded nails. It was heavy, too, for when Martha tried to lift one end of it she found she could not stir it a bit. But there was a place in the side of the cover for a key. She stooped to examine the lock, and saw that it would take a rather big key to open it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>Then, as you may suspect, the little girl longed to open Uncle Walter"s big box and see what was in it. For we are all curious, and little girls are just as curious as the rest of us.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'>"I don"t b"lieve Uncle Walter"ll ever come back," she thought. "Papa said once that some elephant must have killed him. If I only had a key--" She stopped and clapped her little hands together gayly as she remembered a big basket of keys on the shelf in the linen closet. They were of all sorts and sizes; perhaps one of them would unlock the mysterious chest!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='22'>She flew down the stairs, found the basket and returned with it to the attic. Then she sat down before the brass-studded box and began trying one key after another in the curious old lock. Some were too large, but most were too small. One would go into the lock but would not turn; another stuck so fast that she feared for a time that she would never get it out again. But at last, when the basket was almost empty, an oddly-shaped, ancient brass key slipped easily into the lock. With a cry of joy <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lid;accord;joy;cry;hand;moment' adjectives='heavy;sharp;own;key;next' verbs='fly;turn;hear;click' valence='5.672' arousal='4.21' dominance='5.472'>Martha</entity> turned the key with both hands; then she heard a sharp "click," and the next moment the heavy lid flew up of its own accord!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='23'>The little girl leaned over the edge of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='eye;edge;sight;amazement;instant;girl' adjectives='little' verbs='meet;cause;lean;start' valence='5.945' arousal='4.21071428571' dominance='5.60642857143'>the chest</entity> an instant, and the sight that met her eyes caused her to start back in amazement.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='24'>Slowly and carefully a man unpacked himself from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='limb;child;hat;man' adjectives='astonished;unpacked' verbs='stretch;step;take;bow' valence='5.4525' arousal='4.23833333333' dominance='5.75583333333'>the chest</entity>, stepped out upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='limb;child;hat;man' adjectives='astonished;unpacked' verbs='stretch;step;take;bow' valence='5.4525' arousal='4.23833333333' dominance='5.75583333333'>the floor</entity>, stretched his limbs and then took off his hat and bowed politely to the astonished child.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='25'>He was tall and thin and his face seemed badly tanned or sunburnt.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='26'>Then another man emerged from the chest, yawning and rubbing his eyes like a sleepy schoolboy. He was of middle size and his skin seemed as badly tanned as that of the first.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='27'>While Martha stared open-mouthed at the remarkable sight a third man crawled from the chest. He had the same complexion as his fellows, but was short and fat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='28'>All three were dressed in a curious manner. They wore short jackets of red velvet braided with gold, and knee breeches of sky-blue satin with silver buttons. Over their stockings were laced wide ribbons of red and yellow and blue, while their hats had broad brims with high, peaked crowns, from which fluttered yards of bright-colored ribbons.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='29'>They had big gold rings in their ears and rows of knives and pistols in their belts. Their eyes were black and glittering and they wore long, fierce mustaches, curling at the ends like a pig"s tail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='30'>"My! but you were heavy," exclaimed the fat one, when he had pulled down his velvet jacket and brushed the dust from his sky-blue breeches. "And you squeezed me all out of shape."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='31'>"It was unavoidable, Luigi," responded the thin man, lightly; "the lid of the chest pressed me down upon you. Yet I tender you my regrets."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='32'>"As for me," said the middle-sized man, carelessly rolling a cigarette and lighting it, "you must acknowledge I have been your nearest friend for years; so do not be disagreeable."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='33'>"You mustn"t smoke in the attic," said Martha, recovering herself at sight of the cigarette. "You might set <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fire' adjectives='' verbs='set' valence='5.58' arousal='4.36666666667' dominance='5.59666666667'>the house</entity> on fire."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='34'>The middle-sized man, who had not noticed her before, at this speech turned to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='speech;man' adjectives='middle-sized' verbs='turn;notice;have;bow' valence='5.84285714286' arousal='3.98857142857' dominance='5.72142857143'>the girl</entity> and bowed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='35'>"Since a lady requests it," said he, "I shall abandon my cigarette," and he threw it on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foot;request;lady;cigarette' adjectives='' verbs='abandon;say;extinguish;throw' valence='5.0325' arousal='4.1425' dominance='5.5525'>the floor</entity> and extinguished it with his foot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='36'>"Who are you?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='astonished' verbs='ask;be;have;frighten' valence='5.50666666667' arousal='4.2' dominance='5.155'>Martha</entity>, who until now had been too astonished to be frightened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='37'>"Permit us to introduce ourselves," said the thin man, flourishing his hat gracefully. "This is Lugui," the fat man nodded; "and this is Beni," the middle-sized man bowed; "and I am Victor. We are three bandits--Italian bandits."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='38'>"Bandits!" cried <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horror;look' adjectives='' verbs='cry' valence='4.3875' arousal='5.085' dominance='4.2325'>Martha</entity>, with a look of horror.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='39'>"Exactly. Perhaps in all the world there are not three other bandits so terrible and fierce as ourselves," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bandit;world' adjectives='fierce;other;terrible' verbs='be;say' valence='4.92125' arousal='4.3175' dominance='5.3525'>Victor</entity>, proudly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='40'>""Tis so," said the fat man, nodding gravely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='41'>"But it"s wicked!" exclaimed <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='exclaim' valence='5.0' arousal='5.0' dominance='5.0'>Martha</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='42'>"Yes, indeed," replied Victor. "We are extremely and tremendously wicked. Perhaps in all the world you could not find three men more wicked than those who now stand before you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>""Tis so," said the fat man, approvingly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='44'>"But you shouldn"t be so wicked," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;t' adjectives='naughty;wicked' verbs='be;shouldn;say' valence='5.36375' arousal='5.1125' dominance='5.2525'>the girl</entity>; "it"s--it"s--naughty!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='46'>"Naughty!" gasped <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='look' adjectives='horrified' verbs='gasp' valence='5.15' arousal='4.79' dominance='5.18666666667'>Beni</entity>, with a horrified look.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='47'>""Tis a hard word," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='face;word;hand;tis' adjectives='hard' verbs='say;bury' valence='5.03428571429' arousal='4.57857142857' dominance='5.67'>Luigi</entity>, sadly, and buried his face in his hands.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='48'>"I little thought," murmured Victor, in a voice broken by emotion, "ever to be so reviled--and by a lady! Yet, perhaps you spoke thoughtlessly. You must consider, miss, that our wickedness has an excuse. For how are we to be bandits, let me ask, unless we are wicked?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>Martha was puzzled and shook her head, thoughtfully. Then she remembered something.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='50'>"You can"t remain bandits any longer," said she, "because you are now in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bandit;t' adjectives='longer' verbs='be;remain;say' valence='5.51' arousal='4.06333333333' dominance='5.86166666667'>America</entity>."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='53'>The bandits seemed greatly bewildered by this announcement. Lugui sat down on an old chair with a broken rocker and wiped his forehead with a yellow silk handkerchief. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;face' adjectives='pale' verbs='stare;look;fall' valence='5.15875' arousal='3.89625' dominance='5.49625'>Beni</entity> and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;face' adjectives='pale' verbs='stare;look;fall' valence='5.15875' arousal='3.89625' dominance='5.49625'>Victor</entity> fell back upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='eye;face' adjectives='pale' verbs='stare;look;fall' valence='5.15875' arousal='3.89625' dominance='5.49625'>the chest</entity> and looked at her with pale faces and staring eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='54'>When he had somewhat recovered himself <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='recover;have;speak' valence='6.05666666667' arousal='4.04333333333' dominance='5.84'>Victor</entity> spoke.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='55'>"Your Uncle Walter has greatly wronged us," he said, reproachfully.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>""Tis so!" said the fat man, slapping his leg sharply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='57'>"And we had won such fine reputations in Italy!" said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='regretfully' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='5.91' arousal='4.43' dominance='6.88'>Beni</entity>, regretfully.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>"A great deal can be done in a big American city," said the child. "My father is a lawyer" (the bandits shuddered), "and my mother"s cousin is a police inspector."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='140'>An accomplished wizard once lived on the top floor of a tenement house and passed his time in thoughtful study and studious thought. What he didn"t know about wizardry was hardly worth knowing, for he possessed all the books and recipes of all the wizards who had lived before him; and, moreover, he had invented several wizardments himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='141'>This admirable person would have been completely happy but for the numerous interruptions to his studies caused by folk who came to consult him about their troubles (in which he was not interested), and by the loud knocks of the iceman, the milkman, the baker"s boy, the laundryman and the peanut woman. He never dealt with any of these people; but they rapped at his door every day to see him about this or that or to try to sell him their wares. Just when he was most deeply interested in his books or engaged in watching the bubbling of a cauldron there would come a knock at his door. And after sending the intruder away he always found he had lost his train of thought or ruined his compound.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='142'>At length these interruptions aroused his anger, and he decided he must have a dog to keep people away from his door. He didn"t know where to find a dog, but in the next room lived a poor glass-blower with whom he had a slight acquaintance; so he went into <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='acquaintance;room;glass-blower;dog;s;apartment;t' adjectives='poor;slight;next' verbs='didn;ask;live;know;have;go;find' valence='5.66055555556' arousal='4.26166666667' dominance='5.44333333333'>the man</entity>"s apartment and asked:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='143'>"Where can I find a dog?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='144'>"What sort of a dog?" inquired the glass-blower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='145'>"A good dog. One that will bark at people and drive them away. One that will be no trouble to keep and won"t expect to be fed. One that has no fleas and is neat in his habits. One that will obey me when I speak to him. In short, a good dog," said the wizard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='146'>"Such a dog is hard to find," returned the glass-blower, who was busy making a blue glass flower pot with a pink glass rosebush in it, having green glass leaves and yellow glass roses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='147'>The wizard watched him thoughtfully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='148'>"Why cannot you blow me a dog out of glass?" he asked, presently.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='149'>"I can," declared the glass-blower; "but it would not bark at people, you know."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='150'>"Oh, I"ll fix that easily enough," replied the other. "If I could not make a glass dog bark I would be a mighty poor wizard."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='151'>"Very well; if you can use a glass dog I"ll be pleased to blow one for you. Only, you must pay for my work."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='152'>"Certainly," agreed the wizard. "But I have none of that horrid stuff you call money. You must take some of my wares in exchange."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='153'>The glass-blower considered the matter for a moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='154'>"Could you give me something to cure my rheumatism?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='155'>"Oh, yes; easily."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='156'>"Then it"s a bargain. I"ll start the dog at once. What color of glass shall I use?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='157'>"Pink is a pretty color," said the wizard, "and it"s unusual for a dog, isn"t it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='158'>"Very," answered the glass-blower; "but it shall be pink."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='159'>So the wizard went back to his studies and the glass-blower began to make the dog.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='160'>Next morning he entered the wizard"s room with the glass dog under his arm and set it carefully upon the table. It was a beautiful pink in color, with a fine coat of spun glass, and about its neck was twisted a blue glass ribbon. Its eyes were specks of black glass and sparkled intelligently, as do many of the glass eyes worn by men.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='161'>The wizard expressed himself pleased with the glass-blower"s skill and at once handed him a small vial.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='162'>"This will cure your rheumatism," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='163'>"But the vial is empty!" protested the glass-blower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='164'>"Oh, no; there is one drop of liquid in it," was the wizard"s reply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='165'>"Will one drop cure my rheumatism?" inquired the glass-blower, in wonder.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='166'>"Most certainly. That is a marvelous remedy. The one drop contained in the vial will cure instantly any kind of disease ever known to humanity. Therefore it is especially good for rheumatism. But guard it well, for it is the only drop of its kind in the world, and I"ve forgotten the recipe."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='167'>"Thank you," said the glass-blower, and went back to his room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='168'>Then the wizard cast a wizzy spell and mumbled several very learned words in the wizardese language over the glass dog. Whereupon the little animal first wagged its tail from side to side, then winked his left eye knowingly, and at last began barking in a most frightful manner--that is, when you stop to consider the noise came from a pink glass dog. There is something almost astonishing in the magic arts of wizards; unless, of course, you know how to do the things yourself, when you are not expected to be surprised at them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='169'>The wizard was as delighted as a school teacher at the success of his spell, although he was not astonished. Immediately he placed the dog outside his door, where it would bark at anyone who dared knock and so disturb the studies of its master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='170'>The glass-blower, on returning to his room, decided not to use the one drop of wizard cure-all just then.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='171'>"My rheumatism is better to-day," he reflected, "and I will be wise to save the medicine for a time when I am very ill, when it will be of more service to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='172'>So he placed the vial in his cupboard and went to work blowing more roses out of glass. Presently he happened to think the medicine might not keep, so he started to ask the wizard about it. But when he reached the door the glass dog barked so fiercely that he dared not knock, and returned in great haste to his own room. Indeed, the poor man was quite upset at so unfriendly a reception from the dog he had himself so carefully and skillfully made.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='173'>The next morning, as he read his newspaper, he noticed an article stating that the beautiful Miss Mydas, the richest young lady in town, was very ill, and the doctors had given up hope of her recovery.</paragraph>

He suddenly recollected his precious medicine, and determined to use it to better advantage than relieving his own ills.

But the foolish king just deceased had squandered every penny in riotous living. He had then taxed his subjects until most of them became paupers, and this money vanished in more riotous living. Next he sold all the grand old furniture in the palace; all the silver and gold plate and bric-a-brac; all the rich carpets and furnishings and even his own kingly wardrobe, reserving only a soiled and moth-eaten ermine robe to fold over his threadbare raiment. And he spent the money in further riotous living.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='286'>Like all boys, be they kings or paupers, his majesty had torn and soiled his one suit of clothes, so that they were hardly presentable; and there was no money to buy new ones.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='454'>THE ENCHANTED TYPES</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='455'>One time a knook became tired of his beautiful life and longed for something new to do. The knooks have more wonderful powers than any other immortal folk--except, perhaps, the fairies and ryls. So one would suppose that a knook who might gain anything he desired by a simple wish could not be otherwise than happy and contented. But such was not the case with Popopo, the knook we are speaking of. He had lived thousands of years, and had enjoyed all the wonders he could think of. Yet life had become as tedious to him now as it might be to one who was unable to gratify a single wish.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='456'>Finally, by chance, Popopo thought of the earth people who dwell in cities, and so he resolved to visit them and see how they lived. This would surely be fine amusement, and serve to pass away many wearisome hours.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='457'>Therefore one morning, after a breakfast so dainty that you could scarcely imagine it, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='city;breakfast;midst' adjectives='big;dainty' verbs='be;set;imagine' valence='6.05846153846' arousal='4.02923076923' dominance='5.66076923077'>Popopo</entity> set out for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='city;breakfast;midst' adjectives='big;dainty' verbs='be;set;imagine' valence='6.05846153846' arousal='4.02923076923' dominance='5.66076923077'>the earth</entity> and at once was in the midst of a big city.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='458'>His own dwelling was so quiet and peaceful that the roaring noise of the town startled him. His nerves were so shocked that before he had looked around three minutes he decided to give up the adventure, and instantly returned home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='459'>This satisfied for a time his desire to visit the earth cities, but soon the monotony of his existence again made him restless and gave him another thought. At night the people slept and the cities would be quiet. He would visit them at night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>So at the proper time Popopo transported himself in a jiffy to a great city, where he began wandering about the streets. Everyone was in bed. No wagons rattled along the pavements; no throngs of busy men shouted and halloaed. Even the policemen slumbered slyly and there happened to be no prowling thieves abroad.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='461'>His nerves being soothed by the stillness, Popopo began to enjoy himself. He entered many of the houses and examined their rooms with much curiosity. Locks and bolts made no difference to a knook, and he saw as well in darkness as in daylight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='462'>After a time he strolled into the business portion of the city. Stores are unknown among the immortals, who have no need of money or of barter and exchange; so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='goods;barter;exchange;money;collection;immortal;merchandise;sight;need;store' adjectives='unknown;many;interested;novel' verbs='be;have' valence='6.00866666667' arousal='4.20866666667' dominance='5.608'>Popopo</entity> was greatly interested by the novel sight of so many collections of goods and merchandise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>During his wanderings he entered a millinery shop, and was surprised to see within a large glass case a great number of women"s hats, each bearing in one position or another a stuffed bird. Indeed, some of the most elaborate hats had two or three birds upon them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='464'>Now knooks are the especial guardians of birds, and love them dearly. To see so many of his little friends shut up in a glass case annoyed and grieved Popopo, who had no idea they had purposely been placed upon the hats by the milliner. So he slid back one of the doors of the case, gave the little chirruping whistle of the knooks that all birds know well, and called:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='465'>"Come, friends; <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='friend' adjectives='open' verbs='fly;be;come' valence='6.04' arousal='3.96833333333' dominance='5.88333333333'>the door</entity> is open--fly out!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='466'>Popopo did not know the birds were stuffed; but, stuffed or not, every bird is bound to obey a knook"s whistle and a knook"s call.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='468'>Then he opened the outer door for them and cried: "Off with you! Fly away, my beauties, and be happy again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='469'>The astonished birds at once obeyed, and when they had soared away into the night air the knook closed <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='knook;street;bird;air' adjectives='astonished' verbs='obey;continue;have;close;wander;soar' valence='5.94916666667' arousal='3.825' dominance='5.55166666667'>the door</entity> and continued his wandering through the streets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='470'>By dawn he saw many interesting sights, but day broke before he had finished <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='dawn;sight' adjectives='many;interesting' verbs='finish;break;see;resolve;have;come' valence='5.94785714286' arousal='3.85857142857' dominance='5.64571428571'>the city</entity>, and he resolved to come the next evening a few hours earlier.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='471'>As soon as it was dark the following day he came again to the city and on passing the millinery shop noticed a light within.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='473'>"Cheer up, sister," said one. "Even though your pretty birds have all been stolen the hats themselves remain."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='474'>"Alas!" cried the other, who was the milliner, "no one will buy my hats partly trimmed, for the fashion is to wear birds upon them. And if I cannot sell my goods I shall be utterly ruined."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='475'>Then she renewed her sobbing and the knook stole away, feeling a little ashamed to realized that in his love for the birds he had unconsciously wronged one of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sobbing;people;love;knook;bird' adjectives='little;unhappy;ashamed' verbs='feel;make;renew;wrong;have;steal;realize' valence='5.30875' arousal='4.3525' dominance='5.32375'>the earth</entity> people and made her unhappy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='476'>This thought brought him back to the millinery shop later in the night, when the two women had gone home. He wanted, in some way, to replace the birds upon the hats, that the poor woman might be happy again. So he searched until he came upon a nearby cellar full of little gray mice, who lived quite undisturbed and gained a livelihood by gnawing through the walls into neighboring houses and stealing food from the pantries.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='477'>"Here are just the creatures," thought Popopo, "to place upon the woman"s hats. Their fur is almost as soft as the plumage of the birds, and it strikes me the mice are remarkably pretty and graceful animals. Moreover, they now pass their lives in stealing, and were they obliged to remain always upon women"s hats their morals would be much improved."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='478'>So he exercised a charm that drew all the mice from the cellar and placed them upon the hats in the glass case, where they occupied the places the birds had vacated and looked very becoming--at least, in the eyes of the unworldly knook.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='479'>She came in the early morning, accompanied by her sister, and her face wore a sad and resigned expression.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='480'>But when she saw a tiny gray mouse nestling among the ribbons and laces she gave a loud shriek, and, dropping the hat, sprang with one bound to the top of the table.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='484'>Instantly they all jumped from the hats, dashed out the open door of the glass case and scampered away to their cellar.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='486'>Yet he could not escape a sad feeling of responsibility, and after thinking upon the matter he decided that since he had caused the milliner"s unhappiness by freeing the birds, he could set the matter right by restoring them to the glass case.

Sometimes he called upon the busy editors and befuddled their brains until they wrote exactly what he wanted them to.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='875'>Tanko-Mankie laughed to himself the low, gurgling little laugh that always means mischief. Then he flew close to the wax figure and breathed twice upon its forehead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='876'>From that instant the dummy began to live, but so dazed and astonished was she at the unexpected sensation that she continued to stand stupidly staring at the women outside and holding out the placard as before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='877'>The ryl laughed again and flew away. Anyone but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='elf;anyone;wax;fun;world;trouble;lady' adjectives='naughty;rare;loose;heartless;sure;cold;inexperienced' verbs='be;overtake;help;shift;leave;turn;remain;have;think' valence='5.5016' arousal='4.3168' dominance='5.64'>Tanko-Mankie</entity> would have remained to help the wax lady out of the troubles that were sure to overtake her; but this naughty elf thought it rare fun to turn the inexperienced lady loose in a cold and heartless world and leave her to shift for herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='878'>Fortunately it was almost six o"clock when the dummy first realized that she was alive, and before she had collected her new thoughts and decided what to do a man came around and drew down all <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='dummy;shopper;clock;shades;o;thought;view;man' adjectives='new;alive;curious' verbs='do;draw;have;be;shut;collect;decide;come;realize' valence='5.89583333333' arousal='3.99208333333' dominance='5.80625'>the window</entity> shades, shutting off the view from the curious shoppers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='879'>Then the clerks and cashiers and floorwalkers and cash girls went home and the store was closed for the night, although the sweepers and scrubbers remained to clean the floors for the following day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='880'>The window inhabited by the wax lady was boxed in, like a little room, one small door being left at the side for the window-trimmer to creep in and out of. So the scrubbers never noticed that the dummy, when left to herself, dropped the placard to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='scrubber;dummy;silk;placard;pile' adjectives='alive' verbs='be;notice;sit;drop;leave;happen;wonder' valence='5.53666666667' arousal='4.012' dominance='5.528'>the floor</entity> and sat down upon a pile of silks to wonder who she was, where she was, and how she happened to be alive.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='881'>For you must consider, dear reader, that in spite of her size and her rich costume, in spite of her pink cheeks and fluffy yellow hair, this lady was very young--no older, in reality, than a baby born but half an hour. All she knew of the world was contained in the glimpse she had secured of the busy street facing her window; all she knew of people lay in the actions of the group of women which had stood before her on the other side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='glimpse;woman;group;fit;people;appearance;window;street;pane;action;world;dress;side' adjectives='stylish;busy;other' verbs='be;remark;secure;criticise;face;stand;know;have;contain;lay' valence='5.95714285714' arousal='3.78178571429' dominance='5.72964285714'>the window</entity> pane and criticised the fit of her dress or remarked upon its stylish appearance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='882'>So she had little enough to think about, and her thoughts moved somewhat slowly; yet one thing she really decided upon, and that was not to remain in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thought;thing;woman;lot' adjectives='little;enough;handsome' verbs='stare;be;have;move;remain;decide;dress;think' valence='6.04888888889' arousal='3.80277777778' dominance='5.80888888889'>the window</entity> and be insolently stared at by a lot of women who were not nearly so handsome or well dressed as herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='883'>By the time she reached this important conclusion, it was after midnight; but dim lights were burning in the big, deserted store, so she crept through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='aisle;wealth;light;finery;window;curiosity;time;side;store;conclusion' adjectives='dim;important;much;long;big' verbs='be;pause;look;confront;burn;reach;walk;desert;creep' valence='5.58375' arousal='3.90666666667' dominance='5.63'>the door</entity> of her window and walked down the long aisles, pausing now and then to look with much curiosity at the wealth of finery confronting her on every side.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='884'>When she came to the glass cases filled with trimmed hats she remembered having seen upon the heads of the women in the street similar creations. So she selected one that suited her fancy and placed it carefully upon her yellow locks. I won"t attempt to explain what instinct it was that made her glance into a near-by mirror to see if the hat was straight, but this she certainly did. It didn"t correspond with her dress very well, but the poor thing was too young to have much taste in matching colors.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='885'>When she reached the glove counter she remembered that gloves were also worn by the women she had seen. She took a pair from the case and tried to fit them upon her stiff, wax-coated fingers; but the gloves were too small and ripped in the seams. Then she tried another pair, and several others, as well; but hours passed before she finally succeeded in getting her hands covered with a pair of pea-green kids.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='886'>Next she selected a parasol from a large and varied assortment in the rear of the store. Not that she had any idea what it was used for; but other ladies carried such things, so she also would have one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='887'>When she again examined herself critically in the mirror she decided her outfit was now complete, and to her inexperienced eyes there was no perceptible difference between her and the women who had stood outside the window. Whereupon she tried to leave the store, but found every door fast locked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='888'>The wax lady was in no hurry. She inherited patience from her previous existence. Just to be alive and to wear beautiful clothes was sufficient enjoyment for her at present. So she sat down upon a stool and waited quietly until daylight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='889'>When the janitor unlocked the door in the morning the wax lady swept past him and walked with stiff but stately strides down the street. The poor fellow was so completely whuckered at seeing the well-known wax lady leave her window and march away from the store that he fell over in a heap and only saved himself from fainting by striking his funny bone against the doorstep. When he recovered his wits she had turned the corner and disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='890'>The wax lady"s immature mind had reasoned that, since she had come to life, her evident duty was to mix with the world and do whatever other folks did. She could not realize how different she was from people of flesh and blood; nor did she know she was the first dummy that had ever lived, or that she owed her unique experience to Tanko-Mankie"s love of mischief. So ignorance gave her a confidence in herself that she was not justly entitled to.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='891'>It was yet early in the day, and the few people she met were hurrying along the streets. Many of them turned into restaurants and eating houses, and following their example the wax lady also entered one and sat upon a stool before a lunch counter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='892'>"Coffee "n" rolls!" said a shop girl on the next stool.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='893'>"Coffee "n" rolls!" repeated the dummy, and soon the waiter placed them before her. Of course she had no appetite, as her constitution, being mostly wood, did not require food; but she watched the shop girl, and saw her put the coffee to her mouth and drink it. Therefore the wax lady did the same, and the next instant was surprised to feel the hot liquid trickling out between her wooden ribs. The coffee also blistered her wax lips, and so disagreeable was the experience that she arose and left the restaurant, paying no attention to the demands of the waiter for "20 cents, mum." Not that she intended to defraud him, but the poor creature had no idea what he meant by "20 cents, mum."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='894'>As she came out she met the window trimmer at Floman"s store. The man was rather near-sighted, but seeing something familiar in the lady"s features he politely raised his hat. The wax lady also raised her hat, thinking it the proper thing to do, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hat;face;thing;lady;wax' adjectives='proper;horrified' verbs='do;hurry;raise;think' valence='5.74333333333' arousal='4.07833333333' dominance='5.84083333333'>the man</entity> hurried away with a horrified face.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='895'>Then a woman touched her arm and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='896'>"Beg pardon, ma"am; but there"s a price-mark hanging on your dress behind."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='897'>"Yes, I know," replied the wax lady, stiffly; "it was originally $20, but it"s been reduced to $19.98."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='898'>The woman looked surprised at such indifference and walked on. Some carriages were standing at the edge of the sidewalk, and seeing the dummy hesitate a driver approached her and touched his cap.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='899'>"Cab, ma"am?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='900'>"No," said she, misunderstanding him; "I"m wax."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='907'>She shook her head and glanced at a paper.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='913'>"I wonder that he means," thought the poor lady. "Am I really different in some way from all the others? I look like them, certainly; and I try to act like them; yet that boy called me a dummy and seemed to think I acted queerly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='914'>This idea worried her a little, but she walked on to the corner, where she noticed a street car stop to let some people on. The wax lady, still determined to do as others did, also boarded the car and sat down quietly in a corner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='915'>After riding a few blocks the conductor approached her and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='916'>"Fare, please!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='919'>She stared at him stupidly, trying to think what he meant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='920'>"Come, come!" growled the conductor, "either pay up or get off!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='921'>Still she did not understand, and he grabbed her rudely by the arm and lifted her to her feet. But when his hand came in contact with the hard wood of which her arm was made the fellow was filled with surprise. He stooped down and peered into her face, and, seeing it was wax instead of flesh, he gave a yell of fear and jumped from the car, running as if he had seen a ghost.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='922'>At this the other passengers also yelled and sprang from the car, fearing a collision; and the motorman, knowing something was wrong, followed suit. The wax lady, seeing the others run, jumped from the car last of all, and stepped in front of another car coming at full speed from the opposite direction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='923'>She heard cries of fear and of warning on all sides, but before she understood her danger she was knocked down and dragged for half a block.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='924'>When the car was brought to a stop a policeman reached down and pulled her from under the wheels. Her dress was badly torn and soiled.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='961'>The King of the Polar Bears lived among the icebergs in the far north country. He was old and monstrous big; he was wise and friendly to all who knew him. His body was thickly covered with long, white hair that glistened like silver under the rays of the midnight sun. His claws were strong and sharp, that he might walk safely over the smooth ice or grasp and tear the fishes and seals upon which he fed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='962'>The seals were afraid when he drew near, and tried to avoid him; but the gulls, both white and gray, loved him because he left the remnants of his feasts for them to devour.</paragraph>

The poor creature ran away with piteous bleats, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bleat;animal;creature' adjectives='poor;frightened;piteous' verbs='strike;follow;run;laugh' valence='5.21444444444' arousal='4.95555555556' dominance='4.89'>the boy</entity> laughed and followed after it, striking the frightened animal again and again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1063'>"Really," thought the butterfly, "I do not wonder <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='butterfly;child' adjectives='cruel;wicked' verbs='do;be;hate;think;wonder' valence='5.265' arousal='4.39166666667' dominance='5.40666666667'>the mandarin</entity> hates children, if they are all so cruel and wicked as this one."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1064'>The calf having escaped him the boy came back to the road, where he met two little girls on their way to school. One of them had a red apple in her hand, and the boy snatched it away and began eating it. The little girl commenced to cry, but her companion, more brave and sturdy, cried out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1065'>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you nasty boy!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1066'>At this <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='whereupon;face' adjectives='pretty' verbs='begin;sob;reach;slap' valence='5.38857142857' arousal='4.26857142857' dominance='5.38142857143'>the boy</entity> reached out and slapped her pretty face, whereupon she also began to sob.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1067'>Although possessed of neither soul nor conscience, the butterfly had a very tender heart, and now decided it could endure this boy no longer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1068'>"If I permitted him to exist," it reflected, "I should never forgive myself, for the monster would do nothing but evil from morning "til night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1069'>So it flew directly into his face and touched his forehead with its sticky front feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1070'>The next instant <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='direction;instant;sty;pig' adjectives='next' verbs='grunt;run;disappear;have' valence='5.335' arousal='4.124' dominance='5.637'>the boy</entity> had disappeared, but a grunting pig ran swiftly up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='direction;instant;sty;pig' adjectives='next' verbs='grunt;run;disappear;have' valence='5.335' arousal='4.124' dominance='5.637'>the road</entity> in the direction of its sty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1071'>The butterfly gave a sigh of relief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1072'>"This time I have indeed used the mandarin"s magic upon a child," it whispered, as it floated lazily upon the light breeze; "but since the child was originally a pig I do not think I have any cause to reproach myself. The little girls were sweet and gentle, and I would not injure them to save my life, but were all boys like this transformed pig, I should not hesitate to carry out <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='boy;life;pig;s;girl;order' adjectives='sweet;little;gentle' verbs='be;hesitate;injure;transform;carry;save' valence='5.95238095238' arousal='4.29047619048' dominance='5.5480952381'>the mandarin</entity>"s orders."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1073'>Then it flew into a rose bush, where it remained comfortably until evening. At sundown it returned to its master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1074'>"Have you changed two of them into pigs?" he asked, at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1075'>"I have," replied the butterfly. "One was a pretty, black-eyed baby, and the other a freckle-faced, red-haired, barefooted newboy."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1076'>"Good! Good! Good!" screamed the mandarin, in an ecstasy of delight. "Those are the ones who torment me the most! Change every newboy you meet into a pig!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1077'>"Very well," answered the butterfly, quietly, and ate its supper of molasses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1078'>Several days were passed by the butterfly in the same manner. It fluttered aimlessly about the flower gardens while the sun shone, and returned at night to the mandarin with false tales of turning children into swine. Sometimes it would be one child which was transformed, sometimes two, and occasionally three; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='butterfly;child;delight;s;molasses;supper' adjectives='intense' verbs='report;be;transform;greet;give' valence='6.275' arousal='4.03388888889' dominance='5.65611111111'>the mandarin</entity> always greeted the butterfly"s report with intense delight and gave him molasses for supper.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1079'>One evening, however, the butterfly thought it might be well to vary the report, so that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='butterfly;pig;master;child;report;creature' adjectives='suspicious' verbs='be;lie;vary;grow;answer;have;ask;think;change' valence='5.72125' arousal='3.8425' dominance='5.36125'>the mandarin</entity> might not grow suspicious; and when its master asked what child had been had been changed into a pig that day the lying creature answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1080'>"It was a Chinese boy, and when I touched him he became a black pig."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1081'>This angered the mandarin, who was in an especially cross mood. He spitefully snapped the butterfly with his finger, and nearly broke its beautiful wing; for he forgot that Chinese boys had once mocked him and only remembered his hatred for American boys.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1082'>The butterfly became very indignant at this abuse from the mandarin. It refused to eat its molasses and sulked all the evening, for it had grown to hate <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='molasses;child' adjectives='hated;much' verbs='refuse;eat;have;sulk;hate;grow' valence='5.40818181818' arousal='3.95272727273' dominance='5.37545454545'>the mandarin</entity> almost as much as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='molasses;child' adjectives='hated;much' verbs='refuse;eat;have;sulk;hate;grow' valence='5.40818181818' arousal='3.95272727273' dominance='5.37545454545'>the mandarin</entity> hated children.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1085'>The butterfly did not reply.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1086'>Soon after a gentleman came into the room for his laundry. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='place;pig' adjectives='scrawny;repulsive' verbs='be;run;squeal' valence='5.171' arousal='4.332' dominance='5.079'>The mandarin</entity> was not there, but running around the place was a repulsive, scrawny pig, which squealed most miserably.</paragraph>

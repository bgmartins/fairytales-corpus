	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='10'>No one intended to leave Martha alone that afternoon, but it happened that everyone was called away, for one reason or another. Mrs. McFarland was attending the weekly card party held by the Women"s Anti-Gambling League. Sister Nell"s young man had called quite unexpectedly to take her for a long drive. Papa was at the office, as usual. It was Mary Ann"s day out. As for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='house;girl;nature' adjectives='little;restless' verbs='look;have;stay' valence='5.957' arousal='4.037' dominance='5.424'>Emeline</entity>, she certainly should have stayed in the house and looked after the little girl; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='house;girl;nature' adjectives='little;restless' verbs='look;have;stay' valence='5.957' arousal='4.037' dominance='5.424'>Emeline</entity> had a restless nature.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='11'>"Would you mind, miss, if I just crossed the alley to speak a word to Mrs. Carleton"s girl?" she asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.95' arousal='3.48' dominance='6.29'>Martha</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='12'>""Course not," replied the child. "You"d better lock the back door, though, and take the key, for I shall be upstairs."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='13'>"Oh, I"ll do that, of course, miss," said the delighted maid, and ran away to spend the afternoon with her friend, leaving <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='maid;house;ll;bargain;course;friend' adjectives='big;delighted' verbs='do;run;lock;leave;say;miss;spend' valence='5.805' arousal='4.245' dominance='5.7075'>Martha</entity> quite alone in the big house, and locked in, into the bargain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='14'>The little girl read a few pages in her new book, sewed a few stitches in her embroidery and started to "play visiting" with her four favorite dolls. Then she remembered that in the attic was a doll"s playhouse that hadn"t been used for months, so she decided she would dust it and put it in order.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='15'>Filled with this idea, the girl climbed the winding stairs to the big room under the roof. It was well lighted by three dormer windows and was warm and pleasant. Around the walls were rows of boxes and trunks, piles of old carpeting, pieces of damaged furniture, bundles of discarded clothing and other odds and ends of more or less value. Every well-regulated house has an attic of this sort, so I need not describe it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='16'>The doll"s house had been moved, but after a search <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='search;doll;house;s;corner;chimney' adjectives='big' verbs='be;move;find;have' valence='5.57153846154' arousal='3.93692307692' dominance='5.41'>Martha</entity> found it away over in a corner near the big chimney.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='17'>She drew it out and noticed that behind it was a black wooden chest which Uncle Walter had sent over from Italy years and years ago--before Martha was born, in fact. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hunt;hunter;uncle;key;elephant;home' adjectives='unopened;mighty' verbs='be;return;wish;wander;remain;hear;have;go;tell' valence='6.05416666667' arousal='3.8175' dominance='5.67458333333'>Mamma</entity> had told her about it one day; how there was no key to it, because Uncle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hunt;hunter;uncle;key;elephant;home' adjectives='unopened;mighty' verbs='be;return;wish;wander;remain;hear;have;go;tell' valence='6.05416666667' arousal='3.8175' dominance='5.67458333333'>Walter</entity> wished it to remain unopened until he returned home; and how this wandering uncle, who was a mighty hunter, had gone into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hunt;hunter;uncle;key;elephant;home' adjectives='unopened;mighty' verbs='be;return;wish;wander;remain;hear;have;go;tell' valence='6.05416666667' arousal='3.8175' dominance='5.67458333333'>Africa</entity> to hunt elephants and had never been heard from afterwards.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='18'>The little girl looked at the chest curiously, now that it had by accident attracted her attention.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='19'>It was quite big--bigger even than mamma"s traveling trunk--and was studded all over with tarnished brassheaded nails. It was heavy, too, for when Martha tried to lift one end of it she found she could not stir it a bit. But there was a place in the side of the cover for a key. She stooped to examine the lock, and saw that it would take a rather big key to open it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>Then, as you may suspect, the little girl longed to open Uncle Walter"s big box and see what was in it. For we are all curious, and little girls are just as curious as the rest of us.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'>"I don"t b"lieve Uncle Walter"ll ever come back," she thought. "Papa said once that some elephant must have killed him. If I only had a key--" She stopped and clapped her little hands together gayly as she remembered a big basket of keys on the shelf in the linen closet. They were of all sorts and sizes; perhaps one of them would unlock the mysterious chest!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='22'>She flew down the stairs, found the basket and returned with it to the attic. Then she sat down before the brass-studded box and began trying one key after another in the curious old lock. Some were too large, but most were too small. One would go into the lock but would not turn; another stuck so fast that she feared for a time that she would never get it out again. But at last, when the basket was almost empty, an oddly-shaped, ancient brass key slipped easily into the lock. With a cry of joy <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lid;accord;joy;cry;hand;moment' adjectives='heavy;sharp;own;key;next' verbs='fly;turn;hear;click' valence='5.672' arousal='4.21' dominance='5.472'>Martha</entity> turned the key with both hands; then she heard a sharp "click," and the next moment the heavy lid flew up of its own accord!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='23'>The little girl leaned over the edge of the chest an instant, and the sight that met her eyes caused her to start back in amazement.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='24'>Slowly and carefully a man unpacked himself from the chest, stepped out upon the floor, stretched his limbs and then took off his hat and bowed politely to the astonished child.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='25'>He was tall and thin and his face seemed badly tanned or sunburnt.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='26'>Then another man emerged from the chest, yawning and rubbing his eyes like a sleepy schoolboy. He was of middle size and his skin seemed as badly tanned as that of the first.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='27'>While Martha stared open-mouthed at the remarkable sight a third man crawled from the chest. He had the same complexion as his fellows, but was short and fat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='28'>All three were dressed in a curious manner. They wore short jackets of red velvet braided with gold, and knee breeches of sky-blue satin with silver buttons. Over their stockings were laced wide ribbons of red and yellow and blue, while their hats had broad brims with high, peaked crowns, from which fluttered yards of bright-colored ribbons.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='29'>They had big gold rings in their ears and rows of knives and pistols in their belts. Their eyes were black and glittering and they wore long, fierce mustaches, curling at the ends like a pig"s tail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='30'>"My! but you were heavy," exclaimed the fat one, when he had pulled down his velvet jacket and brushed the dust from his sky-blue breeches. "And you squeezed me all out of shape."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='31'>"It was unavoidable, Luigi," responded the thin man, lightly; "the lid of the chest pressed me down upon you. Yet I tender you my regrets."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='32'>"As for me," said the middle-sized man, carelessly rolling a cigarette and lighting it, "you must acknowledge I have been your nearest friend for years; so do not be disagreeable."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='33'>"You mustn"t smoke in the attic," said Martha, recovering herself at sight of the cigarette. "You might set the house on fire."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='34'>The middle-sized man, who had not noticed her before, at this speech turned to the girl and bowed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='35'>"Since a lady requests it," said he, "I shall abandon my cigarette," and he threw it on the floor and extinguished it with his foot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='36'>"Who are you?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='astonished' verbs='ask;be;have;frighten' valence='5.50666666667' arousal='4.2' dominance='5.155'>Martha</entity>, who until now had been too astonished to be frightened.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='37'>"Permit us to introduce ourselves," said the thin man, flourishing his hat gracefully. "This is Lugui," the fat man nodded; "and this is Beni," the middle-sized man bowed; "and I am Victor. We are three bandits--Italian bandits."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='38'>"Bandits!" cried <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horror;look' adjectives='' verbs='cry' valence='4.3875' arousal='5.085' dominance='4.2325'>Martha</entity>, with a look of horror.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='39'>"Exactly. Perhaps in all the world there are not three other bandits so terrible and fierce as ourselves," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bandit;world' adjectives='fierce;other;terrible' verbs='be;say' valence='4.92125' arousal='4.3175' dominance='5.3525'>Victor</entity>, proudly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='40'>""Tis so," said the fat man, nodding gravely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='41'>"But it"s wicked!" exclaimed <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='exclaim' valence='5.0' arousal='5.0' dominance='5.0'>Martha</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='42'>"Yes, indeed," replied Victor. "We are extremely and tremendously wicked. Perhaps in all the world you could not find three men more wicked than those who now stand before you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>""Tis so," said the fat man, approvingly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='44'>"But you shouldn"t be so wicked," said the girl; "it"s--it"s--naughty!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='45'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye' adjectives='' verbs='cast;blush' valence='6.07' arousal='3.82333333333' dominance='5.08'>Victor</entity> cast down his eyes and blushed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='46'>"Naughty!" gasped <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='look' adjectives='horrified' verbs='gasp' valence='5.15' arousal='4.79' dominance='5.18666666667'>Beni</entity>, with a horrified look.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='47'>""Tis a hard word," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='face;word;hand;tis' adjectives='hard' verbs='say;bury' valence='5.03428571429' arousal='4.57857142857' dominance='5.67'>Luigi</entity>, sadly, and buried his face in his hands.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='48'>"I little thought," murmured Victor, in a voice broken by emotion, "ever to be so reviled--and by a lady! Yet, perhaps you spoke thoughtlessly. You must consider, miss, that our wickedness has an excuse. For how are we to be bandits, let me ask, unless we are wicked?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>Martha was puzzled and shook her head, thoughtfully. Then she remembered something.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='50'>"You can"t remain bandits any longer," said she, "because you are now in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bandit;t' adjectives='longer' verbs='be;remain;say' valence='5.51' arousal='4.06333333333' dominance='5.86166666667'>America</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>"America!" cried the three, together.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='52'>"Certainly. You are on Prairie avenue, in Chicago. Uncle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chest;uncle' adjectives='' verbs='send' valence='5.95333333333' arousal='4.14333333333' dominance='5.92'>Walter</entity> sent you here from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='chest;uncle' adjectives='' verbs='send' valence='5.95333333333' arousal='4.14333333333' dominance='5.92'>Italy</entity> in this chest."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='53'>The bandits seemed greatly bewildered by this announcement. Lugui sat down on an old chair with a broken rocker and wiped his forehead with a yellow silk handkerchief. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chest;eye;face' adjectives='pale' verbs='stare;look;fall' valence='5.15875' arousal='3.89625' dominance='5.49625'>Beni</entity> and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chest;eye;face' adjectives='pale' verbs='stare;look;fall' valence='5.15875' arousal='3.89625' dominance='5.49625'>Victor</entity> fell back upon the chest and looked at her with pale faces and staring eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='54'>When he had somewhat recovered himself <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='recover;have;speak' valence='6.05666666667' arousal='4.04333333333' dominance='5.84'>Victor</entity> spoke.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='55'>"Your Uncle Walter has greatly wronged us," he said, reproachfully. "He has taken us from our beloved <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bandit;country;rob;ransom' adjectives='much;strange;beloved' verbs='be;bring;know;have;ask;respect;take' valence='5.28125' arousal='4.255' dominance='5.39'>Italy</entity>, where bandits are highly respected, and brought us to a strange country where we shall not know whom to rob or how much to ask for a ransom."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>""Tis so!" said the fat man, slapping his leg sharply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='57'>"And we had won such fine reputations in Italy!" said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='regretfully' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='5.91' arousal='4.43' dominance='6.88'>Beni</entity>, regretfully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='58'>"Perhaps Uncle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='uncle' adjectives='' verbs='suggest;want;reform' valence='5.775' arousal='4.4675' dominance='5.51'>Walter</entity> wanted to reform you," suggested <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='uncle' adjectives='' verbs='suggest;want;reform' valence='5.775' arousal='4.4675' dominance='5.51'>Martha</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='59'>"Are there, then, no bandits in Chicago?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.95' arousal='3.48' dominance='6.29'>Victor</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>"Well," replied the girl, blushing in her turn, "we do not call them bandits."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='61'>"Then what shall we do for a living?" inquired <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='inquire' valence='5.32' arousal='3.73' dominance='6.25'>Beni</entity>, despairingly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>"A great deal can be done in a big American city," said the child. "My father is a lawyer" (the bandits shuddered), "and my mother"s cousin is a police inspector."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='63'>"Ah," said Victor, "that is a good employment. The police need to be inspected, especially in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='need;police' adjectives='' verbs='be;inspect' valence='5.37' arousal='4.275' dominance='4.695'>Italy</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='64'>"Everywhere!" added <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='add' valence='6.23' arousal='4.0' dominance='6.79'>Beni</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>"Then you could do other things," continued Martha, encouragingly. "You could be motor men on trolley cars, or clerks in a department store. Some people even become aldermen to earn a living."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>The bandits shook their heads sadly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>"We are not fitted for such work," said Victor. "Our business is to rob."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='68'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='try;think' valence='6.16' arousal='3.875' dominance='6.22'>Martha</entity> tried to think.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>"It is rather hard to get positions in the gas office," she said, "but you might become politicians."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>"No!" cried Beni, with sudden fierceness; "we must not abandon our high calling. Bandits we have always been, and bandits we must remain!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>""Tis so!" agreed the fat man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='72'>"Even in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='rob;cheerfulness;people' adjectives='' verbs='be;remark' valence='4.896' arousal='3.968' dominance='5.166'>Chicago</entity> there must be people to rob," remarked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rob;cheerfulness;people' adjectives='' verbs='be;remark' valence='4.896' arousal='3.968' dominance='5.166'>Victor</entity>, with cheerfulness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='73'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='distressed' verbs='be' valence='4.78' arousal='4.855' dominance='4.83'>Martha</entity> was distressed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>"I think they have all been robbed," she objected.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='75'>"Then we can rob the robbers, for we have experience and talent beyond the ordinary," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='talent;experience;robber' adjectives='ordinary' verbs='rob;say;have' valence='5.1775' arousal='4.375' dominance='5.68375'>Beni</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='76'>"Oh, dear; oh, dear!" moaned the girl; "why did Uncle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='girl;uncle;chest' adjectives='' verbs='moan;send;do' valence='5.745' arousal='4.475' dominance='5.90333333333'>Walter</entity> ever send you here in this chest?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>The bandits became interested.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='78'>"That is what we should like to know," declared <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='declare;be;like;know' valence='6.465' arousal='3.8675' dominance='5.9225'>Victor</entity>, eagerly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='79'>"But no one will ever know, for Uncle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='uncle;conviction;hunting;elephant' adjectives='' verbs='be;continue;know;lose' valence='5.386' arousal='3.691' dominance='5.432'>Walter</entity> was lost while hunting elephants in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='uncle;conviction;hunting;elephant' adjectives='' verbs='be;continue;know;lose' valence='5.386' arousal='3.691' dominance='5.432'>Africa</entity>," she continued, with conviction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>"Then we must accept our fate and rob to the best of our ability," said Victor. "So long as we are faithful to our beloved profession we need not be ashamed."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>""Tis so!" cried the fat man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>"Brothers! we will begin now. Let us rob the house we are in."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>"Good!" shouted the others and sprang to their feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='84'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='child' adjectives='' verbs='turn' valence='6.325' arousal='4.405' dominance='5.54'>Beni</entity> turned threateningly upon the child.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"Remain here!" he commanded. "If you stir one step your blood will be on your own head!" Then he added, in a gentler voice: "Don"t be afraid; that"s the way all bandits talk to their captives. But of course we wouldn"t hurt a young lady under any circumstances."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='86'>"Of course not," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='5.91' arousal='4.43' dominance='6.88'>Victor</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>The fat man drew a big knife from his belt and flourished it about his head.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='91'>And then the three bent themselves nearly double and crept stealthily down the stairway with cocked pistols in their hands and glittering knives between their teeth, leaving <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stairway;help;tooth;hand;fear;pistol;knife' adjectives='double;bent;cocked' verbs='glitter;cry;leave;horrify;tremble;creep' valence='4.71714285714' arousal='4.56785714286' dominance='4.99857142857'>Martha</entity> trembling with fear and too horrified to even cry for help.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>How long she remained alone in the attic she never knew, but finally she heard the catlike tread of the returning bandits and saw them coming up the stairs in single file.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='93'>All bore heavy loads of plunder in their arms, and Lugui was balancing a mince pie on the top of a pile of her mother"s best evening dresses.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='96'>"We have much wealth," continued Victor, holding the mince pie while Lugui added his spoils to the heap; "and all from one house! This <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='place' adjectives='rich' verbs='be' valence='5.864' arousal='4.572' dominance='5.784'>America</entity> must be a rich place."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='97'>With a dagger he then cut himself a piece of the pie and handed the remainder to his comrades.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='98'>"We should have a cave," remarked Beni; "for we must store our plunder in a safe place.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>"There"s a Mammoth cave," she answered, "but it"s in Kentucky. You would be obliged to ride on the cars a long time to get there."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>The three bandits looked thoughtful and munched their pie silently, but the next moment they were startled by the ringing of the electric doorbell, which was heard plainly even in the remote attic.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='139'>THE GLASS DOG</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='140'>An accomplished wizard once lived on the top floor of a tenement house and passed his time in thoughtful study and studious thought. What he didn"t know about wizardry was hardly worth knowing, for he possessed all the books and recipes of all the wizards who had lived before him; and, moreover, he had invented several wizardments himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='141'>This admirable person would have been completely happy but for the numerous interruptions to his studies caused by folk who came to consult him about their troubles (in which he was not interested), and by the loud knocks of the iceman, the milkman, the baker"s boy, the laundryman and the peanut woman. He never dealt with any of these people; but they rapped at his door every day to see him about this or that or to try to sell him their wares. Just when he was most deeply interested in his books or engaged in watching the bubbling of a cauldron there would come a knock at his door. And after sending the intruder away he always found he had lost his train of thought or ruined his compound.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='142'>At length these interruptions aroused his anger, and he decided he must have a dog to keep people away from his door. He didn"t know where to find a dog, but in the next room lived a poor glass-blower with whom he had a slight acquaintance; so he went into the man"s apartment and asked:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='143'>"Where can I find a dog?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='144'>"What sort of a dog?" inquired the glass-blower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='145'>"A good dog. One that will bark at people and drive them away. One that will be no trouble to keep and won"t expect to be fed. One that has no fleas and is neat in his habits. One that will obey me when I speak to him. In short, a good dog," said the wizard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='146'>"Such a dog is hard to find," returned the glass-blower, who was busy making a blue glass flower pot with a pink glass rosebush in it, having green glass leaves and yellow glass roses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='147'>The wizard watched him thoughtfully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='148'>"Why cannot you blow me a dog out of glass?" he asked, presently.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='149'>"I can," declared the glass-blower; "but it would not bark at people, you know."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='150'>"Oh, I"ll fix that easily enough," replied the other. "If I could not make a glass dog bark I would be a mighty poor wizard."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='151'>"Very well; if you can use a glass dog I"ll be pleased to blow one for you. Only, you must pay for my work."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='152'>"Certainly," agreed the wizard. "But I have none of that horrid stuff you call money. You must take some of my wares in exchange."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='153'>The glass-blower considered the matter for a moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='154'>"Could you give me something to cure my rheumatism?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='155'>"Oh, yes; easily."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='156'>"Then it"s a bargain. I"ll start the dog at once. What color of glass shall I use?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='157'>"Pink is a pretty color," said the wizard, "and it"s unusual for a dog, isn"t it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='158'>"Very," answered the glass-blower; "but it shall be pink."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='159'>So the wizard went back to his studies and the glass-blower began to make the dog.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='160'>Next morning he entered the wizard"s room with the glass dog under his arm and set it carefully upon the table. It was a beautiful pink in color, with a fine coat of spun glass, and about its neck was twisted a blue glass ribbon. Its eyes were specks of black glass and sparkled intelligently, as do many of the glass eyes worn by men.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='161'>The wizard expressed himself pleased with the glass-blower"s skill and at once handed him a small vial.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='162'>"This will cure your rheumatism," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='163'>"But the vial is empty!" protested the glass-blower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='164'>"Oh, no; there is one drop of liquid in it," was the wizard"s reply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='165'>"Will one drop cure my rheumatism?" inquired the glass-blower, in wonder.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='166'>"Most certainly. That is a marvelous remedy. The one drop contained in the vial will cure instantly any kind of disease ever known to humanity. Therefore it is especially good for rheumatism. But guard it well, for it is the only drop of its kind in the world, and I"ve forgotten the recipe."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='167'>"Thank you," said the glass-blower, and went back to his room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='168'>Then the wizard cast a wizzy spell and mumbled several very learned words in the wizardese language over the glass dog. Whereupon the little animal first wagged its tail from side to side, then winked his left eye knowingly, and at last began barking in a most frightful manner--that is, when you stop to consider the noise came from a pink glass dog. There is something almost astonishing in the magic arts of wizards; unless, of course, you know how to do the things yourself, when you are not expected to be surprised at them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='169'>The wizard was as delighted as a school teacher at the success of his spell, although he was not astonished. Immediately he placed the dog outside his door, where it would bark at anyone who dared knock and so disturb the studies of its master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='170'>The glass-blower, on returning to his room, decided not to use the one drop of wizard cure-all just then.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='171'>"My rheumatism is better to-day," he reflected, "and I will be wise to save the medicine for a time when I am very ill, when it will be of more service to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='172'>So he placed the vial in his cupboard and went to work blowing more roses out of glass. Presently he happened to think the medicine might not keep, so he started to ask the wizard about it. But when he reached the door the glass dog barked so fiercely that he dared not knock, and returned in great haste to his own room. Indeed, the poor man was quite upset at so unfriendly a reception from the dog he had himself so carefully and skillfully made.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='173'>The next morning, as he read his newspaper, he noticed an article stating that the beautiful Miss Mydas, the richest young lady in town, was very ill, and the doctors had given up hope of her recovery.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='174'>The glass-blower, although miserably poor, hard-working and homely of feature, was a man of ideas. He suddenly recollected his precious medicine, and determined to use it to better advantage than relieving his own ills. He dressed himself in his best clothes, brushed his hair and combed his whiskers, washed his hands and tied his necktie, blackened his hoes and sponged his vest, and then put the vial of magic cure-all in his pocket. Next he locked his door, went downstairs and walked through the streets to the grand mansion where the wealthy Miss <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mansion;miss;street;door' adjectives='wealthy;grand' verbs='go;lock;reside;walk' valence='5.709' arousal='3.896' dominance='5.62'>Mydas</entity> resided.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='175'>The butler opened the door and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='176'>"No soap, no chromos, no vegetables, no hair oil, no books, no baking powder. My young lady is dying and we"re well supplied for the funeral."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='177'>The glass-blower was grieved at being taken for a peddler.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='178'>"My friend," he began, proudly; but the butler interrupted him, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='179'>"No tombstones, either; there"s a family graveyard and the monument"s built."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='180'>"The graveyard won"t be needed if you will permit me to speak," said the glass-blower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='181'>"No doctors, sir; they"ve given up my young lady, and she"s given up the doctors," continued the butler, calmly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='182'>"I"m no doctor," returned the glass-blower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='183'>"Nor are the others. But what is your errand?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='184'>"I called to cure your young lady by means of a magical compound."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='185'>"Step in, please, and take a seat in the hall. I"ll speak to the housekeeper," said the butler, more politely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='186'>So he spoke to the housekeeper and the housekeeper mentioned the matter to the steward and the steward consulted the chef and the chef kissed the lady"s maid and sent her to see the stranger. Thus are the very wealthy hedged around with ceremony, even when dying.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='187'>When the lady"s maid heard from the glass-blower that he had a medicine which would cure her mistress, she said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='188'>"I"m glad you came."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='189'>"But," said he, "if I restore your mistress to health she must marry me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='190'>"I"ll make inquiries and see if she"s willing," answered the maid, and went at once to consult Miss Mydas.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='191'>The young lady did not hesitate an instant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='192'>"I"d marry any old thing rather than die!" she cried. "Bring him here at once!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='193'>So the glass-blower came, poured the magic drop into a little water, gave it to the patient, and the next minute Miss <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;patient;drop;glass-blower;water;miss' adjectives='little;magic' verbs='be;come;have;pour;give' valence='5.93666666667' arousal='4.09666666667' dominance='5.346'>Mydas</entity> was as well as she had ever been in her life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='194'>"Dear me!" she exclaimed; "I"ve an engagement at the Fritters" reception to-night. Bring my pearl-colored silk, Marie, and I will begin my toilet at once. And don"t forget to cancel the order for the funeral flowers and your mourning gown."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='195'>"But, Miss Mydas," remonstrated the glass-blower, who stood by, "you promised to marry me if I cured you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='196'>"I know," said the young lady, "but we must have time to make proper announcement in the society papers and have the wedding cards engraved. Call to-morrow and we"ll talk it over."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='197'>The glass-blower had not impressed her favorably as a husband, and she was glad to find an excuse for getting rid of him for a time. And she did not want to miss the Fritters" reception.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='198'>Yet the man went home filled with joy; for he thought his stratagem had succeeded and he was about to marry a rich wife who would keep him in luxury forever afterward.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='199'>The first thing he did on reaching his room was to smash his glass-blowing tools and throw them out of the window.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='200'>He then sat down to figure out ways of spending his wife"s money.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='201'>The following day he called upon <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;cream;chocolate' adjectives='novel;eating' verbs='read;be;call;have' valence='6.00153846154' arousal='3.96846153846' dominance='5.53307692308'>Miss Mydas</entity>, who was reading a novel and eating chocolate creams as happily as if she had never been ill in her life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='202'>"Where did you get the magic compound that cured me?" she asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='203'>"From a learned wizard," said he; and then, thinking it would interest her, he told how he had made the glass dog for the wizard, and how it barked and kept everybody from bothering him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='204'>"How delightful!" she said. "I"ve always wanted a glass dog that could bark."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='205'>"But there is only one in the world," he answered, "and it belongs to the wizard."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='206'>"You must buy it for me," said the lady.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='207'>"The wizard cares nothing for money," replied the glass-blower.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='208'>"Then you must steal it for me," she retorted. "I can never live happily another day unless I have a glass dog that can bark."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='209'>The glass-blower was much distressed at this, but said he would see what he could do.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='210'>On his way home he purchased a heavy sack, and when he passed the wizard"s door and the pink glass dog ran out to bark at him he threw the sack over the dog, tied the opening with a piece of twine, and carried him away to his own room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='211'>The next day he sent the sack by a messenger boy to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gratitude;boy;dog;sack;person;messenger;compliment' adjectives='sure' verbs='desire;be;feel;send;receive;call;steal' valence='6.014' arousal='4.271' dominance='5.841'>Miss Mydas</entity>, with his compliments, and later in the afternoon he called upon her in person, feeling quite sure he would be received with gratitude for stealing the dog she so greatly desired.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='212'>But when he came to the door and the butler opened it, what was his amazement to see the glass dog rush out and begin barking at him furiously.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='213'>"Call off your dog," he shouted, in terror.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='214'>"I can"t, sir," answered the butler. "My young lady has ordered the glass dog to bark whenever you call here. You"d better look out, sir," he added, "for if it bites you, you may have glassophobia!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='215'>This so frightened the poor glass-blower that he went away hurriedly. But he stopped at a drug store and put his last dime in the telephone box so he could talk to Miss Mydas without being bitten by the dog.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='221'>"Well, to tell the truth," said the lady, "I don"t like your looks. Your cheeks are pale and baggy, your hair is coarse and long, your eyes are small and red, your hands are big and rough, and you are bow-legged."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='222'>"But I can"t help my looks!" pleaded the glass-blower; "and you really promised to marry me."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='245'>The wizard went at once to see if this were true, and, sure enough, the glass dog ran out and began barking at him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='255'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='256'>THE QUEEN OF QUOK</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='257'>A king once died, as kings are apt to do, being as liable to shortness of breath as other mortals.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='258'>It was high time this king abandoned his earth life, for he had lived in a sadly extravagant manner, and his subjects could spare him without the slightest inconvenience.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='259'>His father had left him a full treasury, both money and jewels being in abundance. But the foolish king just deceased had squandered every penny in riotous living. He had then taxed his subjects until most of them became paupers, and this money vanished in more riotous living. Next he sold all the grand old furniture in the palace; all the silver and gold plate and bric-a-brac; all the rich carpets and furnishings and even his own kingly wardrobe, reserving only a soiled and moth-eaten ermine robe to fold over his threadbare raiment. And he spent the money in further riotous living.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='260'>Don"t ask me to explain what riotous living is. I only know, from hearsay, that it is an excellent way to get rid of money. And so this spendthrift king found it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='261'>He now picked all the magnificent jewels from this kingly crown and from the round ball on the top of his scepter, and sold them and spent the money. Riotous living, of course. But at last he was at the end of his resources. He couldn"t sell the crown itself, because no one but the king had the right to wear it. Neither could he sell the royal palace, because only the king had the right to live there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='262'>So, finally, he found himself reduced to a bare palace, containing only a big mahogany bedstead that he slept in, a small stool on which he sat to pull off his shoes and the moth-eaten ermine robe.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='263'>In this straight he was reduced to the necessity of borrowing an occasional dime from his chief counselor, with which to buy a ham sandwich. And the chief counselor hadn"t many dimes. One who counseled his king so foolishly was likely to ruin his own prospects as well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='264'>So the king, having nothing more to live for, died suddenly and left a ten-year-old son to inherit the dismantled kingdom, the moth-eaten robe and the jewel-stripped crown.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='265'>No one envied the child, who had scarcely been thought of until he became king himself. Then he was recognized as a personage of some importance, and the politicians and hangers-on, headed by the chief counselor of the kingdom, held a meeting to determine what could be done for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='266'>These folk had helped the old king to live riotously while his money lasted, and now they were poor and too proud to work. So they tried to think of a plan that would bring more money into the little king"s treasury, where it would be handy for them to help themselves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='267'>After the meeting was over the chief counselor came to the young king, who was playing peg-top in the courtyard, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='268'>"Your majesty, we have thought of a way to restore your kingdom to its former power and magnificence."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='269'>"All right," replied his majesty, carelessly. "How will you do it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='270'>"By marrying you to a lady of great wealth," replied the counselor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='271'>"Marrying me!" cried the king. "Why, I am only ten years old!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='272'>"I know; it is to be regretted. But your majesty will grow older, and the affairs of the kingdom demand that you marry a wife."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='273'>"Can"t I marry a mother, instead?" asked the poor little king, who had lost his mother when a baby.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='274'>"Certainly not," declared the counselor. "To marry a mother would be illegal; to marry a wife is right and proper."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='275'>"Can"t you marry her yourself?" inquired his majesty, aiming his peg-top at the chief counselor"s toe, and laughing to see how he jumped to escape it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='276'>"Let me explain," said the other. "You haven"t a penny in the world, but you have a kingdom. There are many rich women who would be glad to give their wealth in exchange for a queen"s coronet--even if the king is but a child. So we have decided to advertise that the one who bids the highest shall become the queen of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='queen' adjectives='highest' verbs='become;advertise;bid;decide;have' valence='5.90625' arousal='3.6975' dominance='5.885'>Quok</entity>."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='278'>"She is too poor," replied the counselor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='279'>"Her teeth are pearls, her eyes are amethysts, and her hair is gold," declared the little king.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='280'>"True, your majesty. But consider that your wife"s wealth must be used.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='281'>The boy shuddered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='282'>"Have your own way," he said, despairingly. "Only let the lady be as dainty as possible and a good playfellow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='283'>"We shall do our best," returned the chief counselor, and went away to advertise throughout the neighboring kingdoms for a wife for the boy king of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;boy;counselor;king;wife' adjectives='chief;best' verbs='go;do;advertise;return;neighbor' valence='5.88230769231' arousal='4.01923076923' dominance='5.53923076923'>Quok</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='284'>There were so many applicants for the privilege of marrying the little king that it was decided to put him up at auction, in order that the largest possible sum of money should be brought into the kingdom. So, on the day appointed, the ladies gathered at the palace from all the surrounding kingdoms--from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='kingdom;republic;lady;palace' adjectives='' verbs='appoint;gather;surround' valence='6.0' arousal='3.91125' dominance='5.62625'>Bilkon</entity>, <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='kingdom;republic;lady;palace' adjectives='' verbs='appoint;gather;surround' valence='6.0' arousal='3.91125' dominance='5.62625'>Mulgravia</entity>, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;republic;lady;palace' adjectives='' verbs='appoint;gather;surround' valence='6.0' arousal='3.91125' dominance='5.62625'>Junkum</entity> and even as far away as the republic of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='kingdom;republic;lady;palace' adjectives='' verbs='appoint;gather;surround' valence='6.0' arousal='3.91125' dominance='5.62625'>Macvelt</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='285'>The chief counselor came to the palace early in the morning and had the king"s face washed and his hair combed; and then he padded the inside of the crown with old newspapers to make it small enough to fit his majesty"s head. It was a sorry looking crown, having many big and little holes in it where the jewels had once been; and it had been neglected and knocked around until it was quite battered and tarnished. Yet, as the counselor said, it was the king"s crown, and it was quite proper he should wear it on the solemn occasion of his auction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='286'>Like all boys, be they kings or paupers, his majesty had torn and soiled his one suit of clothes, so that they were hardly presentable; and there was no money to buy new ones. Therefore the counselor wound the old ermine robe around the king and sat him upon the stool in the middle of the otherwise empty audience chamber.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='287'>And around him stood all the courtiers and politicians and hangers-on of the kingdom, consisting of such people as were too proud or lazy to work for a living. There was a great number of them, you may be sure, and they made an imposing appearance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='288'>Then the doors of the audience chamber were thrown open, and the wealthy ladies who aspired to being queen of Quok came trooping in. The king looked them over with much anxiety, and decided they were each and all old enough to be his grandmother, and ugly enough to scare away the crows from the royal cornfields. After which he lost interest in them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='289'>But the rich ladies never looked at the poor little king squatting upon his stool. They gathered at once about the chief counselor, who acted as auctioneer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='290'>"How much am I offered for the coronet of the queen of Quok?" asked the counselor, in a loud voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='291'>"Where is the coronet?" inquired a fussy old lady who had just buried her ninth husband and was worth several millions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='292'>"There isn"t any coronet at present," explained the chief counselor, "but whoever bids highest will have the right to wear one, and she can then buy it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='293'>"Oh," said the fussy old lady, "I see." Then she added: "I"ll bid fourteen dollars."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='294'>"Fourteen thousand dollars!" cried a sour-looking woman who was thin and tall and had wrinkles all over her skin--"like a frosted apple," the king thought.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='295'>The bidding now became fast and furious, and the poverty-stricken courtiers brightened up as the sum began to mount into the millions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='296'>"He"ll bring us a very pretty fortune, after all," whispered one to his comrade, "and then we shall have the pleasure of helping him spend it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='297'>The king began to be anxious. All the women who looked at all kind-hearted or pleasant had stopped bidding for lack of money, and the slender old dame with the wrinkles seemed determined to get the coronet at any price, and with it the boy husband. This ancient creature finally became so excited that her wig got crosswise of her head and her false teeth kept slipping out, which horrified the little king greatly; but she would not give up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='298'>At last the chief counselor ended the auction by crying out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='299'>"Sold to Mary Ann Brodjinsky de la Porkus for three million, nine hundred thousand, six hundred and twenty-four dollars and sixteen cents!" And the sour-looking old woman paid the money in cash and on the spot, which proves this is a fairy story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='300'>The king was so disturbed at the thought that he must marry this hideous creature that he began to wail and weep; whereupon the woman boxed his ears soundly. But the counselor reproved her for punishing her future husband in public, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='301'>"You are not married yet. Wait until to-morrow, after the wedding takes place. Then you can abuse him as much as you wish. But at present we prefer to have people think this is a love match."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='302'>The poor king slept but little that night, so filled was he with terror of his future wife. Nor could he get the idea out of his head that he preferred to marry the armorer"s daughter, who was about his own age. He tossed and tumbled around upon his hard bed until the moonlight came in at the window and lay like a great white sheet upon the bare floor. Finally, in turning over for the hundredth time, his hand struck against a secret spring in the headboard of the big mahogany bedstead, and at once, with a sharp click, a panel flew open.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='303'>The noise caused the king to look up, and, seeing the open panel, he stood upon tiptoe, and, reaching within, drew out a folded paper. It had several leaves fastened together like a book, and upon the first page was written:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='304'>"When the king is in trouble   This leaf he must double   And set it on fire   To obtain his desire."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='305'>This was not very good poetry, but when the king had spelled it out in the moonlight he was filled with joy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='306'>"There"s no doubt about my being in trouble," he exclaimed; "so I"ll burn it at once, and see what happens."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='307'>He tore off the leaf and put the rest of the book in its secret hiding place. Then, folding the paper double, he placed it on the top of his stool, lighted a match and set fire to it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='308'>It made a horrid smudge for so small a paper, and the king sat on the edge of the bed and watched it eagerly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='309'>When the smoke cleared away he was surprised to see, sitting upon the stool, a round little man, who, with folded arms and crossed legs, sat calmly facing the king and smoking a black briarwood pipe.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>"Well, here I am," said he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='311'>"So I see," replied the little king. "But how did you get here?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='312'>"Didn"t you burn the paper?" demanded the round man, by way of answer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='313'>"Yes, I did," acknowledged the king.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='314'>"Then you are in trouble, and I"ve come to help you out of it. I"m the Slave of the Royal Bedstead."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='315'>"Oh!" said the king. "I didn"t know there was one."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='316'>"Neither did your father, or he would not have been so foolish as to sell everything he had for money. By the way, it"s lucky for you he did not sell this bedstead. Now, then, what do you want?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='317'>"I"m not sure what I want," replied the king; "but I know what I don"t want, and that is the old woman who is going to marry me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='318'>"That"s easy enough," said the Slave of the Royal Bedstead. "All you need do is to return her the money she paid the chief counselor and declare the match off. Don"t be afraid. You are the king, and your word is law."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='319'>"To be sure," said the majesty. "But I am in great need of money. How am I going to live if the chief counselor returns to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='counselor;return;million' adjectives='chief' verbs='go;be;live' valence='6.31125' arousal='4.17125' dominance='5.4575'>Mary Ann Brodjinski</entity> her millions?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='320'>"Phoo! that"s easy enough," again answered the man, and, putting his hand in his pocket, he drew out and tossed to the king an old-fashioned leather purse. "Keep that with you," said he, "and you will always be rich, for you can take out of the purse as many twenty-five-cent silver pieces as you wish, one at a time. No matter how often you take one out, another will instantly appear in its place within the purse."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='321'>"Thank you," said the king, gratefully. "You have rendered me a rare favor; for now I shall have money for all my needs and will not be obliged to marry anyone. Thank you a thousand times!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='322'>"Don"t mention it," answered the other, puffing his pipe slowly and watching the smoke curl into the moonlight. "Such things are easy to me. Is that all you want?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='323'>"All I can think of just now," returned the king.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='324'>"Then, please close that secret panel in the bedstead," said the man; "the other leaves of the book may be of use to you some time."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='325'>The boy stood upon the bed as before and, reaching up, closed the opening so that no one else could discover it. Then he turned to face his visitor, but the Slave of the Royal Bedstead had disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='326'>"I expected that," said his majesty; "yet I am sorry he did not wait to say good-by."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='327'>With a lightened heart and a sense of great relief the boy king placed the leathern purse underneath his pillow, and climbing into bed again slept soundly until morning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='328'>When the sun rose his majesty rose also, refreshed and comforted, and the first thing he did was to send for the chief counselor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='329'>That mighty personage arrived looking glum and unhappy, but the boy was too full of his own good fortune to notice it. Said he:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='330'>"I have decided not to marry anyone, for I have just come into a fortune of my own. Therefore I command you return to that old woman the money she has paid you for the right to wear the coronet of the queen of Quok. And make public declaration that the wedding will not take place."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='331'>Hearing this the counselor began to tremble, for he saw the young king had decided to reign in earnest; and he looked so guilty that his majesty inquired:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='332'>"Well! what is the matter now?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='333'>"Sire," replied the wretch, in a shaking voice, "I cannot return the woman her money, for I have lost it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='334'>"Lost it!" cried the king, in mingled astonishment and anger.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='335'>"Even so, your majesty. On my way home from the auction last night I stopped at the drug store to get some potash lozenges for my throat, which was dry and hoarse with so much loud talking; and your majesty will admit it was through my efforts the woman was induced to pay so great a price. Well, going into the drug store I carelessly left the package of money lying on the seat of my carriage, and when I came out again it was gone. Nor was the thief anywhere to be seen."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='336'>"Did you call the police?" asked the king.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='337'>"Yes, I called; but they were all on the next block, and although they have promised to search for the robber I have little hope they will ever find him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='338'>The king sighed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='339'>"What shall we do now?" he asked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='340'>"I fear you must marry <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='executioner;head;counselor' adjectives='chief' verbs='answer;fear;cut;marry;order' valence='5.08363636364' arousal='4.61454545455' dominance='5.01363636364'>Mary Ann Brodjinski</entity>," answered the chief counselor; "unless, indeed, you order the executioner to cut her head off."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='341'>"That would be wrong," declared the king. "The woman must not be harmed. And it is just that we return her money, for I will not marry her under any circumstances."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='342'>"Is that private fortune you mentioned large enough to repay her?" asked the counselor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='343'>"Why, yes," said the king, thoughtfully, "but it will take some time to do it, and that shall be your task. Call the woman here."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='344'>The counselor went in search of Mary Ann, who, when she heard she was not to become a queen, but would receive her money back, flew into a violent passion and boxed the chief counselor"s ears so viciously that they stung for nearly an hour. But she followed him into the king"s audience chamber, where she demanded her money in a loud voice, claiming as well the interest due upon it over night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='345'>"The counselor has lost your money," said the boy king, "but he shall pay you every penny out of my own private purse. I fear, however, you will be obliged to take it in small change."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='346'>"That will not matter," she said, scowling upon the counselor as if she longed to reach his ears again; "I don"t care how small the change is so long as I get every penny that belongs to me, and the interest. Where is it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='347'>"Here," answered the king, handing the counselor the leathern purse. "It is all in silver quarters, and they must be taken from the purse one at a time; but there will be plenty to pay your demands, and to spare."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='348'>So, there being no chairs, the counselor sat down upon the floor in one corner and began counting out silver twenty-five-cent pieces from the purse, one by one. And the old woman sat upon the floor opposite him and took each piece of money from his hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='349'>It was a large sum: three million, nine hundred thousand, six hundred and twenty-four dollars and sixteen cents. And it takes four times as many twenty-five-cent pieces as it would dollars to make up the amount.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='350'>The king left them sitting there and went to school, and often thereafter he came to the counselor and interrupted him long enough to get from the purse what money he needed to reign in a proper and dignified manner. This somewhat delayed the counting, but as it was a long job, anyway, that did not matter much.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='351'>The king grew to manhood and married the pretty daughter of the armorer, and they now have two lovely children of their own. Once in awhile they go into the big audience chamber of the palace and let the little ones watch the aged, hoary-headed counselor count out silver twenty-five-cent pieces to a withered old woman, who watched his every movement to see that he does not cheat her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='352'>It is a big sum, three million, nine hundred thousand, six hundred and twenty-four dollars and sixteen cents in twenty-five-cent pieces.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='353'>But this is how the counselor was punished for being so careless with the woman"s money.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='364'>"That is a secret," he said, mysteriously.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>This was enough to put the girl on her guard. She looked at the man and the man looked at her, and both looks were grave and somewhat anxious.</paragraph>

"Your father may be very kind to you, for you are his little girl, you know. But when he"s down-town in his office he"s inclined to be rather severe, especially on book agents.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='382'>When the door had closed behind the queer little man the child sat down in the window again and glanced at the book. It had a red and yellow cover and the word "Thingamajigs" was across the front in big letters.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='399'>"How do you know? Have you ever been one yourself?" inquired the animal; and then he laughed loudly, and the clown laughed, too, as if he enjoyed the remark.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='400'>The girl was quite bewildered by this time. She thoughtlessly turned another leaf, and before she had time to look twice a gray donkey leaped from the book and stumbled from the window seat to the floor with a great clatter.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='454'>THE ENCHANTED TYPES</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='455'>One time a knook became tired of his beautiful life and longed for something new to do. The knooks have more wonderful powers than any other immortal folk--except, perhaps, the fairies and ryls. So one would suppose that a knook who might gain anything he desired by a simple wish could not be otherwise than happy and contented. But such was not the case with Popopo, the knook we are speaking of. He had lived thousands of years, and had enjoyed all the wonders he could think of. Yet life had become as tedious to him now as it might be to one who was unable to gratify a single wish.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='456'>Finally, by chance, Popopo thought of the earth people who dwell in cities, and so he resolved to visit them and see how they lived. This would surely be fine amusement, and serve to pass away many wearisome hours.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='457'>Therefore one morning, after a breakfast so dainty that you could scarcely imagine it, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='earth;breakfast;midst;city' adjectives='big;dainty' verbs='be;set;imagine' valence='6.05846153846' arousal='4.02923076923' dominance='5.66076923077'>Popopo</entity> set out for the earth and at once was in the midst of a big city.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='458'>His own dwelling was so quiet and peaceful that the roaring noise of the town startled him. His nerves were so shocked that before he had looked around three minutes he decided to give up the adventure, and instantly returned home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='459'>This satisfied for a time his desire to visit the earth cities, but soon the monotony of his existence again made him restless and gave him another thought. At night the people slept and the cities would be quiet. He would visit them at night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>So at the proper time Popopo transported himself in a jiffy to a great city, where he began wandering about the streets. Everyone was in bed. No wagons rattled along the pavements; no throngs of busy men shouted and halloaed. Even the policemen slumbered slyly and there happened to be no prowling thieves abroad.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='461'>His nerves being soothed by the stillness, Popopo began to enjoy himself. He entered many of the houses and examined their rooms with much curiosity. Locks and bolts made no difference to a knook, and he saw as well in darkness as in daylight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='462'>After a time he strolled into the business portion of the city. Stores are unknown among the immortals, who have no need of money or of barter and exchange; so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='goods;barter;exchange;money;collection;immortal;merchandise;sight;need;store' adjectives='unknown;many;interested;novel' verbs='be;have' valence='6.00866666667' arousal='4.20866666667' dominance='5.608'>Popopo</entity> was greatly interested by the novel sight of so many collections of goods and merchandise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>During his wanderings he entered a millinery shop, and was surprised to see within a large glass case a great number of women"s hats, each bearing in one position or another a stuffed bird. Indeed, some of the most elaborate hats had two or three birds upon them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='464'>Now knooks are the especial guardians of birds, and love them dearly. To see so many of his little friends shut up in a glass case annoyed and grieved Popopo, who had no idea they had purposely been placed upon the hats by the milliner. So he slid back one of the doors of the case, gave the little chirruping whistle of the knooks that all birds know well, and called:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='465'>"Come, friends; the door is open--fly out!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='466'>Popopo did not know the birds were stuffed; but, stuffed or not, every bird is bound to obey a knook"s whistle and a knook"s call. So they left the hats, flew out of the case and began fluttering about the room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='467'>"Poor dears!" said the kind-hearted knook, "you long to be in the fields and forests again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='468'>Then he opened the outer door for them and cried: "Off with you! Fly away, my beauties, and be happy again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='469'>The astonished birds at once obeyed, and when they had soared away into the night air the knook closed the door and continued his wandering through the streets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='470'>By dawn he saw many interesting sights, but day broke before he had finished the city, and he resolved to come the next evening a few hours earlier.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='471'>As soon as it was dark the following day he came again to the city and on passing the millinery shop noticed a light within. Entering he found two women, one of whom leaned her head upon the table and sobbed bitterly, while the other strove to comfort her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='472'>Of course <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;eye;conversation' adjectives='invisible;mortal' verbs='be;stand;listen' valence='5.86285714286' arousal='3.37428571429' dominance='5.33142857143'>Popopo</entity> was invisible to mortal eyes, so he stood by and listened to their conversation.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='473'>"Cheer up, sister," said one. "Even though your pretty birds have all been stolen the hats themselves remain."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='474'>"Alas!" cried the other, who was the milliner, "no one will buy my hats partly trimmed, for the fashion is to wear birds upon them. And if I cannot sell my goods I shall be utterly ruined."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='475'>Then she renewed her sobbing and the knook stole away, feeling a little ashamed to realized that in his love for the birds he had unconsciously wronged one of the earth people and made her unhappy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='476'>This thought brought him back to the millinery shop later in the night, when the two women had gone home. He wanted, in some way, to replace the birds upon the hats, that the poor woman might be happy again. So he searched until he came upon a nearby cellar full of little gray mice, who lived quite undisturbed and gained a livelihood by gnawing through the walls into neighboring houses and stealing food from the pantries.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='477'>"Here are just the creatures," thought Popopo, "to place upon the woman"s hats. Their fur is almost as soft as the plumage of the birds, and it strikes me the mice are remarkably pretty and graceful animals. Moreover, they now pass their lives in stealing, and were they obliged to remain always upon women"s hats their morals would be much improved."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='478'>So he exercised a charm that drew all the mice from the cellar and placed them upon the hats in the glass case, where they occupied the places the birds had vacated and looked very becoming--at least, in the eyes of the unworldly knook. To prevent their running about and leaving the hats Popopo rendered them motionless, and then he was so pleased with his work that he decided to remain in the shop and witness the delight of the milliner when she saw how daintily her hats were now trimmed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='479'>She came in the early morning, accompanied by her sister, and her face wore a sad and resigned expression. After sweeping and dusting the shop and drawing the blinds she opened the glass case and took out a hat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='480'>But when she saw a tiny gray mouse nestling among the ribbons and laces she gave a loud shriek, and, dropping the hat, sprang with one bound to the top of the table.

Sometimes he called upon the busy editors and befuddled their brains until they wrote exactly what he wanted them to.

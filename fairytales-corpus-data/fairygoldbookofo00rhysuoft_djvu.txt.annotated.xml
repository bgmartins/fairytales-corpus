	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='58'>HE Fairyland that is entered through the  golden door of this book is pictured in  tales and rhymes that have all been  told at one time or another to English  children. Some of these tales have  been forgotten and some have been  lost or long-buried, and so there are several that will  seem new to you who read them here to-day. Such  a story is that of the elfin Green-Knight, which is a  case of a delightful old fairy-tale that grew into as  delightful a romance. A romance indeed is little else  than a fairy-tale for older folk ; and with an eye to the  close kinship between the two the first part of this  book of "Fairy-Gold" tries to show in a new way how  the fairy-tale-tellers and the romancers "swapped" (as  school-boys say) their good things. There you have  a story like that of King Arthur and the Giant of St.  Michael"s Mount, which comes from that noble old  romancer, Sir Thomas Malory. For a fairy-tale, like a cat,  lias nine lives ; it can pass into many queer shapes, and  l^pet not die. You may cut off its head, or drown it in  sentiment or sea-water, or tie a moral to its tail; but it  will still survive, and be found sitting safe by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;tail;sea-water;sentiment' adjectives='safe;moral' verbs='be;cut;sit;drown;survive;tie;find' valence='5.62166666667' arousal='3.87777777778' dominance='5.43611111111'>the fire</entity> some  winter night.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>helped me to find new versions of old favourites like " The  Lambton Worm." And using a ballad-monger"s right, I  have put into its natural shape that other "Laidley" or  "loathly" worm of Spindleston. Every change in these  tales has been made with a real regard for the jealous love  that children feel for their favourites ; and so the literary  touches added by some earlier collectors have been got  rid of here, and the simpler colours of folk-lore and  nursery-lore restored.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>The genuine teller of fairy-tales long ago was an old  woman or gossip of the Mother Goose kind. I am sure  that "Mother Jak," who was nurse to the small prince  who became Edward VI., was one of these. Another  "Mother Jack,"* formerly cook and housewife at Castle  Fortune, who nursed several of the children, has been  made godmother to the second part of this book. It is  sure and certain that she must have told every tale and  sung every song there put down to her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>This too may be said of her,  she could have told us  many things which, now that she has long been dead,  must remain unexplained for ever. She could have told  you what to do if you were "pixy-led,"  like that west-  countryman " who declared and offered to take his Bible-  oath upon it, that, as sure as ever he was alive to tell it,  whilst his head was running round like a mill-wheel, he  heard with his own ears they bits of Pisgies a-laughing and  2^-tacking their hands, all to see he led-astray, and never  able to find the right road, though he had travelled it  scores of times long agone, by night or by day, as a body  might tell," or she could have told you of that girl, who  once knew a man who, "one night, could not find his  way out of his own fields, all he could do, until he  recollected to turn his coat" The moment he did so, he  heard the Pixies all fly away, up into the trees, and there  they sat and laughed. " Oh ! how they did laugh ! "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='69'>In " Mother Jack"s Fairy Book," will be found many of  those shorter fairy-fables and stories, which, just because  they are brief, are in danger of being lost sight of alto-  gether. In Part III., which follows, are fairy tales and  poems from some later writers and poets. Among them  will be found Browning"s "Pied Piper of Hamelin,"  because there is every reason to believe that Hamelin was  as near home as Newtown (Isle of Wight), and that " the  river Weser deep and wide " was the Solent. Of the  stories in the third part, one, "the Defeat of Time," is by  Elia; "Melilot," ** Bacon Pie," and four others are from  the "Oberon"s Horn" of Henry Morley. And of the  songs and poems, Wordsworth, Keats, Tom Hood, each,  have given you one. It was " Robin " Herrick who wrote  the " Queen Mab " poems and the " Fairy Beggar," that  appear in the first part; and John Lyly who wrote the  "Fairies" Frolic." "Catskin," in the same part, has  simply made another change of dress, very much as she  does in the story itself. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='' valence='5.0' arousal='5.0' dominance='5.0'>E.

The second  would take a prince or a great duke even. " Pho,  pho," said the youngest, laughing, "you are both so  proud ; now, I would be content with the Black Bull o"  Norroway." Well, they thought no more of the matter till  the next morning, when, as they sat at breakfast, they  heard the most dreadful bellowing at the door, and what  should it be but the Black Bull come for his bride. You  may be sure they were all terribly frightened at this, for the  Black Bull was one of the most horrible creatures ever  seen in the world. And the king and queen did not know  how to save their daughter. At last they determined to  send him off with the old henwife. So they put her on  his back, and away he went with her till he came to a  great black forest, when, throwing her down, he returned,  roaring louder and more frightfully than ever. They then  sent, one by one, all the servants, then the two eldest  princesses ; but not one of them met with any better treat-  ment than the old henwife, and at last they were forced to  send their youngest and favourite child.</paragraph>

All was joy  then in hall and chamber; and when  the New Year came, it was kept with  great joy. Rich gifts were given and  many lords and ladies took their seats at the, table, where  Queen Guenever sat at the king"s side, and a lady fairer  of form might no one say he had ever before seen. But  King Arthur would not eat nor would he long sit, until he  should have witnessed some wondrous adventure.

Gaily was the knight attired ; his great  beard, like a green bush, hung on his breast. His horse"s  mane was decked with golden threads, and its tail bound  with a green band ; such a horse and such a knight were  never before seen. It seemed that no man might endure  the Green Knight"s blows, but he carried neither spear nor  shield. In one hand he held a holly bough, and in the  other an axe the edge of which was as keen as a sharp  razor, and the handle was encased in iron, curiously graven  with green.</paragraph>

He is dubbed in a doublet  of Tarsic silk, and a well-made hood ; they set steel shoes  on his feet, lap his legs in steel greaves ; put on the steel  habergeon, the well-burnished braces, elbow pieces, and  gloves of plate: while over all is placed the coat armour.  His spurs are then fixed, and his sword is attached to his  side by a silken girdle. Thus attired the knight hears  mass, and afterwards takes leave of Arthur and his Court.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='575'>Here, in our bleak old Cornwall, the first mole was  once a lady of the land. Her abode was in the far west,  among the hills of Morwenna, beside the Severn Sea.  She was the daughter of a lordly race, the only child of  her mother, and the father of the house was dead : her  name was Alice of the Combe. Fair was she and comely,  tender and tall ; and she stood upon the threshold of her  youth. But most of all did men marvel at the glory of  her large blue eyes. They were, to look upon, like the  summer waters, when the sea is soft with light. They  were to her mother a joy, and to the maiden herself, ah,  benedicite ! a pride. She trusted in the loveliness of those  eyes, and in her face and features and form ; and so it  was that the damsel was wont to pass the whole summer  day in the choice of rich apparel and precious stones and  gold. Howbeit this was one of the ancient and "^ommon  usages of those old departed days. Now, in the fashion  of her stateliness and in the hue and texture of her gar-  ments, there was none among the maidens of old Cornwall  like Alice of the Combe. Men sought her far and near,  but she was to them all, like a form of graven stone,  careless and cold. Her soul was set upon a Granville"s  love, fair Sir Beville of Stowe  the flower of the Cornish  chivalry  that noble gentleman ! That valorous knight !</paragraph>

Robes, precious  and many, were unfolded from their rest, and the casket  poured forth jewel and gem, that the maiden might stand  before the knight victorious. It was the day  the hour   the time  her mother sat at her wheel by the hearth  the  page waited in the hall  she came down in her loveliness,  into the old oak room, and stood before the mirrored  glass  her robe was of woven velvet, rich and glossy and  soft ; jewels shone like stars in the midnight of her raven  hair, and on her hand there gleamed afar off a bright and  glorious ring !

East sought they her, and west, in northern  parts and south ; but she was never more seen in the land.  Her mother wept till she had not a tear left ; none sought  to comfort her, for it was vain.

His mill has  been rebuilt; but when 1 was a boy  there, the great old building still stood.  In front of the house was a long mound,  which went by the name of "the  Giant"s grave," and in the mill was  shown a long blade of iron something like a scythe-  blade, but not curved, which was the Giant"s knife.  Now, the Giant who lived at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ground;s;mill;man;bone;bread' adjectives='' verbs='live;make' valence='5.81111111111' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.79444444444'>Dalton</entity> mill, ground men"s  bones to make his bread.</paragraph>

Topcliffe  fair was coming on, and very hard Jack entreated that he  might be allowed to go there to see the lasses and buy  some fairings.

Jack seized the moment, drew the knife away,  and holding it with both his hands drove the blade into  the single eye of the giant, who woke with a howl of  agony, and starting up barred the door.

He was  witty, strong, and valiant, by which  means he subdued his enemies abroad,  and planted peace among his subjects  at home. Nevertheless, in the midst  of all his glory, his queen died, leaving behind her an only  daughter, about fifteen years of age. This little lady, from  her courtly carriage, beauty and affability, was the wonder  of all that knew her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='846'>But as covetousness is the root of all evil, so it  happened here. The king, hearing of a rich dame, who  had an only daughter, for the sake of her riches had a  mind to marry her ; and though she was old, ugly, hook-  nosed, and hump-backed, yet all this could not deter  him from doing so. Her daughter was a yellow dowdy,  full of envy and ill-nature; and, in short, was much of  the same mould as her mother. This signified nothing,  for in a few weeks the king, attended by the nobility  and gentry brought his new queen home to his palace.

She went to the queen,  who gave her a canvas bag of brown bread and hard  cheese, with a bottle of beer ; though this was but a  very pitiful dowry for a king"s daughter.  E 65</paragraph>

His mother could not persuade him to  do anything for her, and was obliged at last to tell him  that if he did not begin to work for his porridge, she  would turn him out to get his living as he could.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='904'>This threat at length roused Jack, and he went out and  hired himself for the day to a farmer for a penny ; but as  he was coming home, never having had any money before,  he lost it in passing over a brook.

Now,  it happened that in the course of his journey there lived a  rich man with his only daughter, a beautiful girl, but  unfortunately deaf and dumb. She had never laughed in  her life, and the doctors said she would never recover till  somebody made her laugh. Many tried without success,  and at last the father, in despair, offered to marry her to  the first man who could make her laugh. This young  lady happened to be looking out of the window when Jack  was passing with the donkey on his shoulders, the legs  sticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical and  strange, that she burst out into a great fit of laughter, and  immediately recovered her speech and hearing. Her  father was overjoyed, and fulfilled his promise by marrying  her to Jack, who was thus made a rich man for life.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1005'>ONG before William the Conqueror,  there dwelt a man in the Isle of Ely,  named Thomas Hickathrift, a poor  labouring man, but so strong that he  was able to do in one day the ordinary  work of two. He had an only son,  whoni he christened Thomas, after his  own name. The old man put his son  to good learning, but he would take none, for he was none  of the wisest, but something soft, and had no docility at all  in him. God calling this good man, the father, to his rest,  his mother, being tender of him, kept him by her hard  labour as well as she could ; but this was no easy matter,  for Tom would sit all day in the chimney-corner, instead  of doing anything to help her, and although at the time  we are speaking of he was only ten years old, he would  eat more than four or five ordinary men, and was five feet  and a half in height, and two feet and a half broad. His  hand was more like a shoulder of mutton than a boy"s  hand, and he was altogether like a little monster ; but yet  his great strength was not known.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1006'>Tom"s strength came to be known in this manner : his  mother, it seems, as well as himself, for they lived in the  days of merry old England, slept upon straw. Now, being  a tidy old creature, she must every now and then have a  new bed, and one day having been promised a bottle of  straw by a neighbouring farmer, after much begging, she  got her son to fetch it. Tom, however, made her borrow  a cart-rope first, before he would budge a step, without  saying what he wanted it for ; but the poor woman, too  glad to gain his help upon any terms, let him have it at  once. Tom, swinging the rope round his shoulders, went  to the farmer"s, and found him with two men threshing in  a barn. Having told what he wanted, the farmer said he  might take as much straw as he could carry. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='' valence='5.0' arousal='5.0' dominance='5.0'>Tom</entity> at</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1011'>After this exploit Tom was no longer allowed to be idle.  Every one tried to secure his services, and we are told  many tales of his mighty strength. On one occasion,  having been offered as great a bundle of firewood as he  could carry, he marched off with one of the largest trees  in the forest. Tom was also extremely fond of attending  fairs; and in cudgelling, wrestling, or throwing the  hammer, there was no one who could compete with him.  He thought nothing of flinging a huge hammer into the  middle of a river a mile off", and, in fact, performed such  extraordinary feats, that the folk began to have a fear of  him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1012'>At length a brewer at Lynn, who required a strong lusty  fellow to carry his beer to the Marsh and to Wisbeach,  after much persuasion, and promising him a new suit of  clothes and as much as he liked to eat and drink, secured  Tom for his business. The distance he daily travelled  with the beer was upwards of twenty miles, for although  there was a shorter cut through the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='distance;giant;cut;slave;district;portion;hand;beer;mile;way;lord;durst;fear;upward' adjectives='shorter;monstrous' verbs='be;travel;kill;lay;go;make' valence='5.21862068966' arousal='4.25517241379' dominance='5.13793103448'>Marsh</entity>, no one durst  go that way for fear of a monstrous giant, who was lord of  a portion of the district, and who killed or made slaves of  every one he could lay his hands upon.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1013'>Now, in the course of time, Tom was thoroughly tired  of going such a roundabout way, and without telling his  plans to any one, he resolved to pass through the giant"s  domain, or lose his life in the attempt. This was a bold  undertaking, but good living had so increased Tom"s  strength and courage, that venturesome as he was before,  his hardiness was so much increased that he would have  faced a still greater danger. He accordingly drove his  cart in the forbidden direction, flinging the gates wide  open, as if for the purpose of making his daring more  plain to be seen.</paragraph>

Do not you care what you do ? But I will  make you an example for all rogues under the sun ! Dost  thou not see how many thousand heads hang upon yonder  tree  heads of those who have offended against my laws ?  But thy head shall hang higher than all the rest for an  example ! " But Tom made him answer : " A dishclout  in your teeth for your news, for you shall not find me to  be one of them." " No ! " said the giant, in astonishment  and indignation ; "and what a fool you must be if you  come to fight with such a one as I am, and bring never  a weapon to defend yourself ! " Quoth Tom, " I have a  weapon here that will make you know you are a traitorly  rogue." This speech highly incensed the giant, who  immediately ran to his cave for his club, intending to  dash out Tom"s brains at one blow. Tom was now much  distressed for a weapon, as by some chance he had forgot  one, and he began to reflect how very little his whip  would help him against a monster twelve feet in height  and six feet round the waist. But while the giant was  gone for his club, Tom bethought himself, and turning his  cart upside down, adroitly takes out the axletree, which  would serve him for a staff, and removing a wheel, fits it  to his arm instead of a shield  very good weapons indeed  in time of trouble, and worthy of Tom"s wit. When the  monster returned with his club, he was amazed to see the  weapons with which Tom had armed himself; but utter-  ing a word of defiance, he bore down upon the poor fellow  with such heavy strokes that it was as much as Tom could  do to defend himself with his wheel. Tom, however, at  length cut the giant a heavy blow with the axletree on the  side of his head, that he nearly reeled over. " What ! "  said Tom, " have you drunk of my strong beer already ? "  This inquiry did not, as we may suppose, mollify the  giant, who laid on his blows so sharply and heavily that  Tom was obliged to defend himself. By-and-bye, not  making any impression on the wheel, he got almost tired  out, and was obliged to ask <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wheel;impression;by-and-bye' adjectives='' verbs='be;tire;get;oblige;make;let;ask' valence='5.755' arousal='3.604' dominance='5.742'>Tom</entity> if he would let him</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1086'>This great magician, who could  assume any form he pleased, was  travelling in the disguise of a poor beggar, and being very  much fatigued, he stopped at the cottage of an honest  ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some refreshment.  The countryman gave him a hearty welcome, and his  wife, who was a very good-hearted, hospitable woman,  soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl, and some  coarse brown bread on a platter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1087'>Merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and  the kindness of the ploughman and his wife ; but he could  not help seeing that though everything was neat and com-  fortable in the cottage, they seemed both to be sad and  much cast down. He therefore questioned them on the  cause of their sadness, and learned that they were miserable  because they had no children.</paragraph>

The droll fancy of such a little  person among the human race pleased the fairy queen too,  greatly, and she promised Merlin that the wish should be  granted. Accordingly, in a short time after, the plough-  man"s wife had a son, who, wonderful to relate, was not a  bit bigger than his father"s thumb.</paragraph>

In the meantime Fortunatus,  when he found himself out of the Earl"s country, stopped  at an inn to refresh himself, and began to reckon how  much he had about him. He took out all his fine clothes  and jewels, and could not help putting them on. He then  looked at himself in the glass, and thought that, to be sure,  he was quite a fine smart fellow. Next he took out his  purse, and counted the money that had been given him by  the lords and ladies of the Earl"s court. He found that in  all he had five hundred crowns ; so he bought a horse,  and took care to send back the one that he had taken from  the Earl"s stable.</paragraph>

This sort of life, as anybody may well  think, soon made away with his little stock of money.  When Fortunatus found that he had not a penny left, he  began to think of going back again to France ; and soon  after went on board a ship bound to Picardy. He landed  in that country ; but finding no employment he set off for  Brittany, when he lost his way in crossing a wood, and was  forced to stay in it all night. The next morning he was  little better off, for he could find no path. So he walked</paragraph>

This drove the bear so very savage,  that he made a great spring to get at him ; the bough  broke, and down he fell, and lay sprawling and howling on  the ground. Fortunatus now looked around on all sides ;  and as he saw no more wild beasts near, he thought this  would be a good time to get rid of the bear at once ; so  down he came, and killed him at a single blow. Being  almost starved for want of food, the poor youth stooped  down, and was going to suck the blood of the bear ; but  looking round once more, to see if any wild beast were  coming, he on a sudden beheld a beautiful lady standing  by his side, with a bandage over her eyes, leaning upon a  wheel, and looking as if she were going to speak, which  she soon did, in these words : " Know, young man, that  my name is Fortune ; I have the power to bestow wisdom,  strength, riches, health, beauty, and long life : one of these  I am willing to grant you  choose for yourself which it  shall be."</paragraph>

But before he went into it, he  thought it would be best to see whether the Lady Fortune  had been as good as her word ; so he put his hand into  his purse, and to his great joy he counted ten pieces of  gold. Having nothing to fear, Fortunatus walked boldly  up to the inn, and called for the best supper they could  get ready in a minute ; " For," said he, " I must wait till  to-morrow before I am very nice. I am so hungry now,  that almost anything will do." Fortunatus very soon ate  quite enough, and then called for every sort of wine in the  house, and drank his fill. After supper, he began to think  what sort of life he should lead ; " For," said he to him-  self, "1 shall now have money enough for everything I  can desire." He slept that night in the very best bed in  the house ; and the next day he ordered the finest victuals  of all kinds.

Fortunatus thought to  himself, "This is the very man I stand in need of;" so  at once he made him a good offer, which the old gentle-  man agreed to, but made the bargain that he might first  go and visit his family. Fortunatus told him that he  should. "And," said he, "as I am a little tired of being  always in the midst of such noisy pleasures as we find at  Paris, I will, with your leave, go with you to Scotland^  and see your wife and children." They set out the very  next day, and came safe to the house of Loch-Fitty ; and  in all the journey, Forlunatus did not once wish to change  his kind companion for all the pleasures and grandeur he  had left behind. Loch-Fitty kissed his wife and children,  five of whom were daughters, and the most beautiful  creatures that were ever beheld. When they were seated,  .his wife said to him: "Ah! dear Lord Loch-Fitty, how  happy I am to see you once again ! Now I hope we shall  enjoy each other"s company for the rest of our lives.

When Lord Loch-Fitty  had ended his story, they agreed that the very next  morning the Lady Cassandra should be asked to accept  the hand of Fortunatus ; and that, if she should consent^  they would set sail in a few days for Famagosta.

However, as he was an easy-tempered gentleman, and  had his betrothed Cassandra and her whole family to  reconcile him to his grief, it did not last very long ;  the wedding took place almost immediately ; so they lived  all together in Famagosta, and in very great style.

A place  more solitary and wild could scarcely  be imagined ; the garden and walks were overgrown with  weeds and briers, and the woods were tangled and un-  pruned. About this domain I would wander till over-  taken by fatigue, and there I would sit down with my back  against some beech, elm or stately alder tree, and, taking  out my book, would pass hours in a state of unmixed  enjoyment, my eyes now fixed on the wondrous pages,  now glancing at the sylvan scene around ; and sometimes  I would drop the book and listen to the voice of the rooks  and wild pigeons, or to the croaking of multitudes of frogs  from the neighbouring swamps and fens.</paragraph>

About seven years ago I happened to  be far down yonder to the west, on the other side of  England. It was a very sultry day, about three o"clock in  the afternoon, when I found myself on some heathy land  near the sea, on the ridge of a hill, the side of which,  nearly as far down as the sea, was heath ; but on the top  there was ground which had been planted, and from which  the harvest had been gathered  oats or barley, I know not  which  but I remember that the ground was covered with  stubble. Well, from the heat of the day and from having  walked about for hours, I felt very tired ; so I laid myself  down, my head just on the ridge of the hill, towards the  field, and my body over the side down amongst the heath.  My bag, which was nearly filled with creatures, lay at a  little distance from my face ; the creatures were struggling  in it, I remember, and I thought to myself, how much  more comfortably off I was than they ; I was taking my  ease on the nice open hill, cooled by the breezes, whilst  they were in the nasty close bag, coiling about one another,  and breaking their very hearts. Little by little I closed  my eyes, and fell into the sweetest snooze ; and there I  lay over the hill"s side, I don"t know how long. At last it  seemed to me that I heard a noise in my sleep, something  like a thing moving, very faint, however, far away ; then it  died, and then it came again upon my ear as I slept, and  now it appeared almost as if I heard crackle, crackle ; then  it died again, or I became yet more dead asleep than  before, I know not which, but I certainly lay some time  without hearing it. All of a sudden I became awake, and  there was I, on the ridge of the hill, with my cheek on the  ground towards the stubble, with a noise in my ear like  that of something moving towards me, among the stubble  of the field ; well, I lay a moment or two, listening to the  noise, and then I became frightened, for I did not like the  noise at all, it sounded so odd ; so I rolled myself over,  and looked towards the stubble. Mercy upon us ! there  was a huge snake, or rather a dreadful viper, for it was all  yellow and gold, moving towards me, bearing its head  about a foot and a half above the ground, the dry stubble  crackling beneath it. It might be about five yards off</paragraph>

Child, what I felt at that moment I can  scarcely say, but it was a sufficient punishment for all the  sins I ever committed : and there we two were, I looking  up at the viper, and the viper looking down upon me,  flickering at me with its tongue. It was only the kindness  of God that saved me : all at once there was a loud npise,  the report of a gun, for a fowler was shooting at some  birds, a little way off in the stubble. Whereupon the viper  sunk its head and immediately made off over the ridge of  the hill, down in the direction of the sea. As it passed by  me, however  and it passed close by me  it hesitated a  moment, as if it was doubtful whether it should not seize  me ; it did not, however, but made off down the hill.

Their habits used to be of red, blue,  or green, according to the old way of country garb, with  high-crowned hats. One time, about fifty years since, a  farmer living at Comb St. Nicholas, a parish lying on one  side of that hill, near Chard, was riding towards his home  that way, and saw, just before him, on the side of the hill,  a great company of people, that seemed to him like  country folks assembled as at a fair. There were all sorts  of commodities, as at our ordinary fairs ; and pewterers,  shoe-makers, pedlars with all kinds of trinkets, fruit and  drinking-booths. He could not remember anything he  had ever seen at a fair but what he saw there. All he  bought was a pewter pot, and when he got home, there  was only a puff-ball in its place.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2063'>The three neighbours refused to take another crumb ;  they had eaten so much tadpole, they said, for their  dinners. Melilot, therefore, supped, but left much bread  and milk, secretly thinking that her friends would require  breakfast, if they should consent to stay with her through-  out the night. It was long since the sun set, reddening  the mists of the plain, and now the mountain path beside  the torrent was all dark and very perilous. The monsters  eagerly watched their little hostess with their brilliant eyes,  and assented, as it seemed, with exultation, to her wish  that they would sleep in the hut. There were but two  beds under its roof  Melilot"s own little straw pallet, and  that on which her parents were to sleep no more, on which  she was no more to kneel beside them in the humble  morning prayer. With sacred thoughts of hospitality the  child gave up to the use of those who had smoothed for  her dear parents a new bed, the bed that was no longer  theirs ; and the three monsters, after looking at her grate-  fully, lay down on it together and went to sleep on it,  with their arms twisted about each other"s necks. The  child looked down upon them, clinging together in their  sleep as in their talk, and saw a weariness of pain defined  in many a kindly-turned line of their half frog-like faces.  If one stirred in sleep, it was to nestle closer to the other  two. " How strange," she said to herself, " that I should  at first have thought them ugly ! " Then she knelt in  prayer by her little nest of straw, and did not forget them  in her prayers. There was a blessing on them in her  heart as she lay down to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2064'>But when Melilot lay down with her face towards the  hearth, the dying embers shone with a red light on the  two solemn graves. She turned her face to the wall, and  the rush of the torrent on the other side was louder than  the passion of her weeping. But the noise of the water-  fall first soothed her, and then, fixing her attention, drew  her from her bed towards the little window, from which  she was able to look out into the black night through  which it roared. A night not altogether black, for there  was a short lull in the rain, though the wind howled round</paragraph>

An air of discomfort sate upon the  queen and upon her courtiers. Their tiny friskings and  gambols were forgot ; and even Robin Goodfellow, for the  first time in his little airy life, looked grave. For the  queen had had melancholy forebodings of late, founded  upon an ancient prophecy laid up in the records of Fairy-  land, that the date of fairy existence should be then extinct  when men should cease to believe in them. And she  knew how that the race of the Nymphs, which were her  predecessors, and had been the guardians of the sacred  floods, and of the silver fountains, and of the consecrated  hills and woods, had utterly disappeared before the chilling  touch of man"s incredulity ; and she sighed bitterly at the  approaching fate of herself and of her subjects, which was  dependent upon so fickle a lease as the capricious and  ever-mutable faith of man. When, as if to realise her  fears, a melancholy shape came gliding in, and that was   Time, who with his intolerable scythe mows down kings  and kingdoms ; at whose dread approach the fays huddled  together as a flock of timorous sheep; and the most  courageous among them crept into acorn-cups, not endur-  ing the sight of that ancientest of monarchs.

But she soon checked  that thought as vain ; for what could the prowess of the  mighty Oberon himself, albeit the stoutest champion in  Fairyland, have availed against so huge a giant, whose  bald top touched the skies ? So, in the mildest tone, she  besought the spectre, that in his mercy he would overlook  and pass by her small subjects, as too diminutive and  powerless to add any worthy trophy to his renown. And  she besought him to employ his resistless strength against  the ambitious children of men, and to lay waste their  aspiring works ; to tumble down their towers and turrets,  and the Babels of their pride,  fit objects of his devouring  scythe,  but to spare her and her harmless race, who had  no existence beyond a dream ; frail objects of a creed that  lived but in the faith of the believer. And with her little  arms, as well as she could, she grasped the stern knees of  Time ; and, waxing speechless with fear, she beckoned to  her chief attendants and maids of honour to come forth  from their hiding-places, and to plead the plea of the  fairies. And one of those small, delicate creatures came  forth at her bidding, clad all in white like a chorister, and  in a low melodious tone, not louder than the hum of a  pretty bee  when it seems to be demurring whether it  shall settle upon this sweet flower or that before it settles,   set forth her humble petition.

"And for lovers," he continued, "my  delight is, with a hurrying hand to snatch them away from  their love-meetings by stealth at nights ; and, in absence,  to stand like a motionless statue, or their leaden planet of  mishap (whence I had my name), till I make their minutes  seem ages."</paragraph>

Its pouting mouth, unknowing  how to speak, lay half opened like a rose-lipped shell ; and  its cheek was softer than any peach, upon which the tears,  for very roundness, could not long dwell, but fell off, in  clearness like pearls,  some on the grass, and some on  his little hand; and some haply wandered to the little  dimpled well under his mouth, which Love himself seemed  to have planned out, but less for tears than for smilings.

So, having com-  passion on its sad plight, my fellows and I turned ourselves  into grasshoppers, and swarmed about the babe, making  such shrill cries as that pretty little chirping creature  makes in its mirth, till with our noise we attracted the  attention of a passing rustic, a tender-hearted hind, who,  wondering at our small but loud concert, strayed aside  curiously, and found the babe, where it lay in the remote  grass, and taking it up, lapped it in his russet coat, and  bore it to his cottage, where his wife kindly nurtured it  till it grew up a goodly personage. How this babe pros-  pered afterwards, let proud London tell. This was that  famous Sir Thomas Gresham, who was the chiefest of her  merchants, the richest, the wisest. Witness his many  goodly vessels on the Thames, freighted with costly  merchandise, jewels from Ind, and pearls for courtly  dames, and silks of Samarcand. And witness, more than  all, that stately Bourse (or Exchange) which he caused to  be built, a mart for merchants from east and west, whose  graceful summit still bears, in token of the fairies" favours,  his chosen crest, the grasshopper.

But by the  golden lustre in his eye, and the passionate wanness in his  cheek, and by the fair and ample space of his forehead,  which seemed a palace framed for the habitation of all  glorious thoughts, he knew that this was his great rival,  who had power given him to rescue whatsoever victims  Time should clutch, and to cause them to live for ever in  his immortal verse.

When King Pipit went to  bed, his pillow was stuffed with those sounds, that soothed  him into easy slumber with assurance that his enemies  were safe. Pipit the Twenty-ninth-and-a-third, Hke his  royal predecessors, knew every captive by the sound of  his or of her footstep, by the rub of the chain, or the tone  of the cry of suffering, or nightly prayer. He made sure  that he had all his groans before he slept in peace, count-  ing them as a good monk might count his beads. When-  ever he missed the stir of any one prisoner, he sent one  of the jailers, who served as his grooms of the bedchamber  to see that all was safe, and to fetch out a groan in some  way for his full and perfect satisfaction. Obstinately silent  prisoners were scourged when Pipit went to bed.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2478'>NCE upon a time there was a great  magician, and his name was Picrotoxin.  His wife"s name was Menisper, and she  was not a conjurer at all, but no more  than a simple, orderly, hard-working  woman. Picrotoxin, being a great con-  jurer himself, did not want two of the  same trade under his roof. He wanted  to agree with a good housewifely soul, who would wonder  at him and obey him, and with whom he could forget his  magic when he pleased, and drop down  or it might be,  climb up  into a happy human life. They had no children,  and they lived in a lone cottage together, on a great lump  of a moorland hill that had a large iron beacon on the top.  In the grate of the beacon an old man, named Moonseed,  the only other person living on the hill, lighted a fire of  nights for the guidance of ships in a sea channel full of  perilous shoals, currents, and tide-ways, from which the  broad back of the hill could be seen when clouds were not  too low. That hill was a huge waste of stone, lichen, puff-  ball, and fern ; of bog, moss, rush, horse-tail, and liver-wort,  covering a tall heap of peat-bog, marshes, pools, and pebbly  wastes of marl, cornstone, and red conglomerate, that rose  and rose for miles about, until it came to a head wherein  the clouds hung when there was any rain at hand. When  the rain really came, it flooded the pools into lakes, soaked  with water the great spongy marshes, and made of nearly  the whole mountain a slough, over which the driving mists  raced after one another, and the water plashed till only <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mountain;door;bittern;lake;rain;water;marsh;slough;duck;mist;pool' adjectives='plashed;whole;great;spongy' verbs='be;soak;make;drive;flood;race;choose;come' valence='6.09173913043' arousal='3.84043478261' dominance='5.61347826087'>the wild</entity> ducks and the bitterns would choose to be out of  doors.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2486'>Somewhere upon the side of this hill lived Picrotoxin,  the immensely powerful magician, and his wife Menisper.  They had no settled address, for it pleased the great man  to move house on the most trivial occasions. Sometimes  his house slipped down hill. Sometimes he ran it round  from one side to another, much to the discomposure of his  wife. For Menisper was expected to do all that a good  cottager"s wife ought to do : to cook, to market, to keep  fowls and a pig ; and it was no small trouble to her, when  she came from market, with a heavy basket on her arm,  home to the place where she had left her house, and found  that it had pleased Picrotoxin, in her absence, to move to  the opposite side of the hill. If he had carried off the  cottage, and forgotten to take with it the poultry and the  pig, the poor woman had to take them along with her in a  search over the mountain-side. Again, if Picrotoxin wished  to keep his wife in her own natural place, and to solace  himself in the intervals of conjuring with that happy pastoral  life to which, as a country maid, she had been born, he  ought not to have turned away from her hog"s lard and fried  potatoes, her rich soup of oatmeal and treacle, her hard  buttered dumpling, or neglected to praise her bold execu-  tion of the favourite pie of the district, made of successive  layers of sliced apple, bacon-fat, and onion, thick layers  and plenty of them, covered in with a stout oily pie-crust.  Her pies could be smelt out at sea when Menisper was  baking them ; and once a ship was wrecked in the channel  below, because the pilot held his nose, instead of steering,  when it was a pie-day on the hill-side. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='conjurer;dinner;wife' adjectives='much' verbs='be;prepare;make;determine;bake;eat;market' valence='6.22' arousal='4.192' dominance='6.248'>Yet Picrotoxin</entity>,  though determined that his wife should market, make, and  bake, was too much of a conjurer to eat the dinners she  prepared for him.</paragraph>

Into those straits at high water the fleet  pushed, and therein at low water every ship was stranded  that had not already run aground.

So one  evening the poor fellow, slipping dole-  fully out of the town in which [he  starved, went for a walk on a neighbouring common. It  was a small rough piece of broken ground, ragged with  briar, fern, and furze, scratched over with deep rutted  paths, drilled into with rabbit-holes, here and there  scooped also into forgotten sand-pits, and dabbled with  pools. At one end a steep and jagged lump of sand-rock  cropped up through the brambles. On the top of the bit  of rock the shoemaker sat down to think. From that  height there was a view over the meadows round about the  common. Behind him they sloped up into a line of bare  downs, with the white chalk glimmering here and there  through their green banks. Before him the rich landscape  was warm with trees. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='deer-park;line;fruit-tree;elm;willow;pear;plum;oak;rank;side;poplar;blackberry;knoll;world;honeysuckle;avenue;hedge;road' adjectives='great;little;yellow;large;other;wild;country-town' verbs='be;gather;raise;lead;overtop;fringe;break;cluster;rise' valence='5.81941176471' arousal='3.79029411765' dominance='5.39529411765'>Alders</entity> and great willows were  clustered near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='deer-park;line;fruit-tree;elm;willow;pear;plum;oak;rank;side;poplar;blackberry;knoll;world;honeysuckle;avenue;hedge;road' adjectives='great;little;yellow;large;other;wild;country-town' verbs='be;gather;raise;lead;overtop;fringe;break;cluster;rise' valence='5.81941176471' arousal='3.79029411765' dominance='5.39529411765'>the river</entity> ; oaks gathered in knolls about <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='deer-park;line;fruit-tree;elm;willow;pear;plum;oak;rank;side;poplar;blackberry;knoll;world;honeysuckle;avenue;hedge;road' adjectives='great;little;yellow;large;other;wild;country-town' verbs='be;gather;raise;lead;overtop;fringe;break;cluster;rise' valence='5.81941176471' arousal='3.79029411765' dominance='5.39529411765'>the slopes</entity> of the deer-park; pear, plum, and other fruit-trees  overtopped the little country-town, and all the yellow roads  that led out from S<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='deer-park;line;fruit-tree;elm;willow;pear;plum;oak;rank;side;poplar;blackberry;knoll;world;honeysuckle;avenue;hedge;road' adjectives='great;little;yellow;large;other;wild;country-town' verbs='be;gather;raise;lead;overtop;fringe;break;cluster;rise' valence='5.81941176471' arousal='3.79029411765' dominance='5.39529411765'>Stavesacre</entity>into the world at large were  fringed with blackberry, wild rose, and honeysuckle hedges,  broken with elms, and upon one side, beyond t<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='deer-park;line;fruit-tree;elm;willow;pear;plum;oak;rank;side;poplar;blackberry;knoll;world;honeysuckle;avenue;hedge;road' adjectives='great;little;yellow;large;other;wild;country-town' verbs='be;gather;raise;lead;overtop;fringe;break;cluster;rise' valence='5.81941176471' arousal='3.79029411765' dominance='5.39529411765'>the bridge</entity>  raised to the rank of an avenue with lines of poplar.</paragraph>

Then he put the pieces back, and, sitting down upon Till"s  spectacle-case, put on the shoes. When they were on, he  got up and danced about in them to try their fit. They  fitted perfectly. Advancing at last to the edge of the table,  he said, " Brother Teel, I am authorised to appoint you  shoemaker in ordinary to the Fairies of the Downs and  Commons.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2804'>NCE upon a time there was a youth,  named Trigonel, who was a grief to  his mother, because he had never in  his Hfe eaten hot meat. As an infant  in arms, hot meat was not his food,  and when he could use his legs he was  abroad at work or at play, so busy or  so idle, that he never came to dinner  till his meat was cold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2805'>Dame Peaflower, Trigonel"s mother, was a proud and  particular woman. It was her noon of glory to set a hot  dish in the middle of her table at the very moment when  the sun  that hot dish on which all the flowers feast   stood in the middle of the day. For the sun to stand still  at noon would not have been more unnatural than for the  potatoes in the pot of Mistress Peaflower to need another  minute"s boiling when the clock struck twelve. Keeping  hot is overcooking. " Better," she said, " let meat be  cold than overcooked." Papilion, her husband, was of  the same mind ; and little Vetch, her only daughter, being  helpful to the mother in the house, and being indeed the  person who peeled the potatoes, always was on the spot  when she ought to be eating. But of her one son, Trigonel,  it was the single fault that he was always behind time in  coming to his dinner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2806'>Yet this Trigonel was a brave, stalwart lad ; able, in  hour of need, to bear the whole weight of the house upon  his shoulders.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2809'>worse, until at last his life was nearly at at end. Trigonel  worked with the strength of two men in the forest. In  many hours of the night he was his father"s watchful nurse.  He found odd moments, too, in which he could make  mirth and sing, with a voice cracking into manly rough-  ness, delicate songs for his small sister Vetch, whose joy  of childhood was not to be quenched because there was a  day of sorrow on its way to her. The young man was  true in short, to everything but his dinner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2810'>Happy are they who in youth have some acquaintance-  ship among the Fairies of the Hours. Aster, the noon  Fairy, was Trigonel"s good friend. She had come to him  in his childhood, when he rolled on his back among the  cowslips of the meadow. Then she appeared, and always,  like the sheen of a maiden in gold armour, with long locks  of golden hair. A plume like a flash of light waved over  the diamond helmet beneath which glanced her blue eyes,  more radiant than all. To other sight than that of  Trigonel she was a ray, and nothing more. At mid-day,  Papilion and Peaflower gave their minds to their meat ;  so that they did not see, as they must have seen had they  but dined at half-past twelve o"clock, the sunshine that  at noon, even when all the upper air was thick with fog  and sleet, would glitter daily for a little while about their  boy.

The light of his  Fairy shone on his brown face and dingy clothes, and  made the fagots glow as if they were ablaze. Grass-  hoppers chirped in the light, butterflies fluttered through  it, and the cups of the golden acorns overhead gleamed  like cut jewels. Aster sat at the youth"s feet, with her  helmet off. She held between her fondling palms the  hands from which the axe had fallen, and was dazzling  him by looking up into his face.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2819'>There was a narrow belt of moor between the forest in  which Trigonel cut wood and his father"s cottage. The  sun was hot on the dry turf, and there was a dropping  fire among the pods of the whin-blossoms that were  scattering their seeds with the pop of a Fairy cannonade.  Suddenly the air was chill, the wind screamed through the  forest, and the forest itself was not to be seen. Overhead  shone the sun, there was blue day over the cottage roof,  beyond was a far prospect over field, and copse, and  stream. But Trigonel looked back upon the blank of  night, through which the wind rushed wailing and sobbing.  Mightier than the wind was presently a sound as of the  stroke of hugest wings by which the air had been thus  beaten to tempest. Then the roar ceased, the storm  rolled back, and the great giant Time, with a face high  and hard as a mountain-top, and with his beard rolling  like a cloud among the clouds, stood still over Trigonel.  One huge arm he upreared, and with the gesture of a  reveller, swept his great hour-glass through the upper sky.</paragraph>

When Time beats with his wings in  angry flight we may be thrown by the wild weather he  makes, as Trigonel was, unexpectedly upon our faces.  Trigonel, when the darkness passed and left him in the  sun again  while it obscured the distant prospect of field,  copse, and stream  perceived with joy that he had fallen  so that his nose struck into a sandbag. Cruel or kind.  Father Time had granted him his wish, and had presented  him with as much as he could carry on his back of that  choice sand in which the grains are minutes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2834'>" Minuces, mother ! " Trigonel cried, jumping up. " A  little time ! " At the word he was down the ladder. In  the room below he fell upon a select party of porkers that  had found their way in, and were thrusting hungry snouts  into his treasure bag. There never was a man yet who  secured himself a little spare time but a part of it was eaten  by the pigs.</paragraph>

Time, he thought, is a thing to hold and  not to swallow. Hurrying back, therefore, to the sick-bed,  he pressed some of the sand into Papilion"s failing grasp.  It was clutched eagerly, and in that instant life flowed back  upon the dying.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2836'>Death-bed life was in this way prolonged. It soon ap-  peared that while Papilion had in his hand some of the  sand, he was the master of so much Time as he held.

But it depended  also on his own grasp of the Fairy gift.

It isn"t only meat that can  be overdone. If I were you, boy, I would throw away  that sackful of leisure.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2842'>In the old days, when the kitchen clock might have  been set by the ways of its mistress, it had never come  into the mind of Dame Peaflower to tell even her son that  she was a punctual woman. Punctuality was nature to  her  no more talked of than digestion by the healthy.  Now, however, she made daily assertion of her good old  principles against the heap of odd minutes that tempted  her. They were so handy. For the sands that had added  minutes to the life of which the time was out, gave also  to healthy people time outside the common day. Sixty  grains held in the hand melted into an hour, of which no  record was kept by clock or sun. If little Vetch wanted  two hours of play instead of one, she took a sixty-grain  packet of Trigonel"s sand ; went out at eleven, played for  two hours, and yet was home again at noon to dinner. If  Madam Peaflower had a day"s washing to get through, she  would hold a linen bag of sand between her little finger  and her palm, while she rubbed in the suds with the other  three fingers and thumb. It was not easy work, but a  day"s washing had been got through in that way, upon one  occasion, between eleven o"clock and one minute past  eleven, when the poor Peaflower was so tired and weary  that she would much rather have gone to bed than cooked  the dinner. The sand being at hand, no little delays were  heeded. There was always time for everything. At one  second to twelve it was not too late to roast an ox before  the clock struck. Always time for everything was on its  way to become no time for anything with the most  punctual of living creatures  and how tired she was !  Although the clock took no note of her added work, she  felt it in her bones. The Fairy-sand gave time, not  strength, beyond the common bounds. Then, too, if  she was tired, how fagged was Trigonel ! That young  man, eager to earn for his mother and sister silk attire,</paragraph>

And when he  did come home to dinner, very likely he would find his  mother fast asleep upon the floor. Always oppressed by  fatigue, she was apt to drop asleep suddenly and unex-  pectedly. Even when she had in her hand the Fairy-sand,  it would then slip from her hold, and the hours of the  day would march in procession over her, till Trigonel came  home and woke her up. Little Vetch, too, when she had  overplayed herself, would drop about the house like a fly  in November.

Lord Shark had made himself  a chain of state from the skeleton hands of good men lost  in a December tempest. He had wrapped himself in a gay  coat, that was the three-coloured flag of their wrecked  vessel ; but as it did not keep him comfortable, he thought  of enlarging it before his next ball with some patches bitten  out of other flags. My Lord had covered his tail with an  odd red cap, much dirtied, and had wriggled till his nose  was set fast in a gilt brass crown, which had in some way  fallen among the fishes. Being nearly stifled by this, he  was obliged to gasp so much that his teeth were constantly  on view. Still my Lord Shark he was, and the feast was his.  Two Cuttlefish, who had covered themselves with more  slime than belonged to them by nature, flaunted in goose  feather. These creatures waited near my Lord"s jaws, and  whenever they saw that he was preparing for a snap,  darkened the water round about him with their ink.

There were some Sprats who had  been present at the breaking of a barrel of pitch, and being  stained  for the pitch stuck  of the colour of Whales, they  believed themselves to be a sort of Whale, and as they  swam, half split themselves with struggling to blow water-  spouts out of their noses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3090'>Distinguished among the company there was the Crab,  who kept a stall or grotto of men"s bones, and who had  filled his grotto with old nails and chips of wood, crosses  and whips, and chains and curiosities in bottles. He had  a sceptre from the broken figure-head of an old war-vessel  fastened to one of his forelegs, and this he trailed behind  him in the mud as he crawled round and round his stall,  in anything but a straightforward way, begging of every  fish who seemed to be of consequence that he would please  to remember the grotto. A free kind of Sword-fish fell into  a passion with this Crab, ran at him, and turned him over  on his back, at the same time knocking his grotto down.  Then there came swimming through the holes they  made in an old three-crowned hat, files of Sardines, who  ran away with the clog on the Crab"s leg, and so left  the poor creature free to scramble quickly out of sight.</paragraph>

He stayed at home for a good  many different-sized reasons, and one great reason  that  he was too busy. For years he had devoted his whole  mind to a question of magic. He had been occupied  intensely with the study of that mysterious line which, till  this day, wit of man or fish never availed to decipher  the  line written in strange letters on the Mackerel"s back.  Clearly these are the varied letters of some words of  mystery. In a strange language writing is traced on the  back of the Mackerel, and it is even underlined in evidence  of its importance. Now, it happened that our Mackerel,  who had been studying his own back for a hundred  years in a glass borrowed from a Mermaid, read the first  letter of the magic line at a time when the revel of the  Shark"s great fancy ball was shaking all the water round  his cave. And in the moment when he knew what was the  interpretation of the first letter, his tail-fins grew into legs  having feet each with a thousand toes, and his gill-fins  stretched themselves into arms having hands each with a</paragraph>

Sometimes, when she meant  soon to come back, her harp had been left in a corner of  his cave. There it was at that moment, ready to be  touched, and the exulting Mackerel, taking it between his  feet, swept his two thousand fingers through its many  strings. Then music, such as no ten-fingered creature  ever made, brought all the Sirens to^his door. A magnifi-</paragraph>

Off and away went, therefore, the walls of the ball-  room. After the walls ran the guests, till, in a little while,  there remained only, in open water, my Lord Shark and his  black Sprats. My Lord, for want of better meat, snapped  at these creatures, made a wry face as he crunched them,  and then spat them out.

" Is it a Mackerel ? "  thought to himself Filarete, the fisherman. " Can a  Mackerel hold up a long arm, stretch a finger, and cry,  * Boat, ahoy ? " " Of course this fisherman did not know  how this fish was studying his letters with advantage to  himself. The first letter he learned gave him a thousand  fingers and a thousand toes. The interpretation of the  second letter on his back having now flashed upon him, he  was able to speak in a thousand tongues. As most fishes  are mute, the greater number of these tongues were those  of men, and beasts, and birds. " My talents are drowned  in the sea," said Mackerel ; " I care not for a fishy  reputation. Why have my tail-fins become legs, except  that I may walk upon the land ? To the land I will go,  being on fire to extend through earth and air the fame that  has already circled through the water." So, as he meant,  nevertheless, to go on studying his back, he tucked under  his arm the Mermaid"s glass, bought for a song. He took  also his new thousand-stringed harp. It was made for him  by the Sirens, of hair from their own tresses, stretched over  the shell of that crawling thing of the deep which once put  the chiefs of men into its purple livery.</paragraph>

But Filarete saw a bush growing near the Mackerel"s  retreat, and felt that he could produce what would be  more stirring than any nonsense verses. He tore off,,  therefore, a long straight bough, rapidly stripped it into a  small pole, and began savagely to thrust at Doctor Pesca-  dillo.

Still, also the slightest freak of  appetite in master and man was so well studied, that each  had under his hand exactly what he wanted, at the moment  when the notion of it came into his head. When they  had eaten, being foot-weary with yesterday"s race and the  morning"s scramble down the mountain"s side, and, further-  more, lazy with fulness of meat, the wayfarers lay down on  their backs and looked up at the sky, wishing for a coach  to come and carry them into the city. There was still  Mackerel enough overhead to engage the attention of the  Doctor. Was it possible that thus, when half asleep, he  seized the true reading of two letters at once? The  tremendous possibility caused him to leap to his feet.  He tried one of them  the fourth of his line  and instantly  a thousand horses, harnessed to a chariot, galloped by.  They halted when the chariot was abreast of Mackerel  and man. Their mouths were free ; there were no reins  to guide them ; and it was noticeable that when any of the  magic coursers put their heads to the dry ground and  opened their mouths, com or hay ran up between their  teeth, and little water springs welled up where they were  thirsty. "The other letter," thought the Doctor, "must  be right since this is right ; but as I get what I want by  the thousand for each letter, and don"t yet know anything  more that I want, let me keep it by me for a little while."</paragraph>

As they  galloped into the city of Picon by the Lake Picuda, there  was a commotion on the pavement, and a rush of bright  eyes to the windows. The two eyes of a lovely Princess  looked out of each of the ten windows of each of the  hundred royal palaces. As horse after horse galloped by  in the same traces, and still no coach, but still more  harnessed horses followed, first there was a cry of joy for  horse-riders, because clearly this was the troop of a grand  circus entering the town. Then, as there came by still  horses and horses, the people cried there were too many  horses, for the land did not yield corn to feed them, and  even if these riders brought so much corn with them, they  should give it to the people, who were hungry.

The hundred kings  deposed themselves for love of him, declared him sole  king, and themselves his viceroys. He changed the next  letter he read into a thousand palaces of wonders, and in  each there was a study, walled with looking-glass, so that  he worked with comfort at the writing on his back. Every  new letter he learnt to utter crowned with thousandfold  fulfilment the wish of the hour. The thousand Princesses  vied for his love ; but he began to see that he could not  be happy with a thousand wives. His last letter, except  the very last, he gave to the wish that the one thousand  dear Princesses could be all rolled into one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3169'>Then there was a sight to be seen ! Royal Princesses  tumbling out of windows and doors, rolling about the streets  like balls, every two that came together lost in one another,  till the thousand had all rolled together into one colossal  damsel. Her the poor little fish was very proud to marry.  He did not think himself small, and yet, being small, a large  wife was entirely to his fancy. Even in common life we  see the shrimps of men marrying whales of women. This  couple was married in great state  the fisherman being  groomsman to the Mackerel, and all her hundred fathers  standing by to give away the bride.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3170'>The wedding ball was so magnificent beyond belief that  King Pescadillo, in his brilliant court, surrounded by his  hundred kingly fathers-in-law, could not help thinking of  the old days under water, where so much was thought of  the Shark"s ball, and when the friends of his youth laughed  at him for staying at home to learn his letters. As he  thought this, he looked at himself in the great mirrors on  the wall. There was the one last letter nearest to his legs.</paragraph>

He looked up, and  saw the ball-room walled with glass, behind which were a  thousand sharks in sea-water glaring upon the company,  he company was in extreme delight at this clever addition</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3179'>Then the little Mackerel"s heart beat with exultation.  ^"Something," he said to himself, "I know not what, is  near. This is my wedding-day, and on this day of all  days I have finished reading the inscription on my back,  letter by letter. If the power of the single letters be so  great as to fulfil wish after wish, and tempt me on till I  learn all, now that I know all, what will be the strength of  the whole charm ! "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3180'>Ah, cunning sorcerer, last of your line, you fellow  who died a thousand thousand years ago, and on your last  day wrote upon a fish"s back the word that would give you  life again when it was spoken, you had reason for being  liberal in your rewards to the fish that would spell out that  word for you !</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3181'>The Royal Pescadillo stood upon the stool before his  throne, and spoke the letter that compelled strict silence.  Then, with panting sides, dread at the great unknown issue  of his adventure tempering his triumph, he gasped out the  entire magic word; and at the word the giant sorcerer,  with a great hairy face, of which the beard trailed behind  his feet, entered the ball-room door. This might be right,  thought Pescadillo, though his little knees knocked at each  other, and the thousand fingers of each hand twitched  nervously. The cruel sorcerer advanced to the poor little  fish, seized him, and thrust him into his great mouth as  the first morsel to be eaten in his second course of life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3182'>The first and last. He should not have been cruel.  With his two thousand little fingers Pescadillo fastened to  the hair about the monster"s lip, and as he hung there he  dug with his two thousand little toes into the monster"s  throat, so that he could not bite ; he could do nothing  but cough and choke. And the wise Mackerel held tight.  He would not be coughed up, though he was almost blown  if his legs by the tremendous coughing. All the company</paragraph>

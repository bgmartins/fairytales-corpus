	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>HE Fairyland that is entered through the  golden door of this book is pictured in  tales and rhymes that have all been  told at one time or another to English  children. Some of these tales have  been forgotten and some have been  lost or long-buried, and so there are several that will  seem new to you who read them here to-day. Such  a story is that of the elfin Green-Knight, which is a  case of a delightful old fairy-tale that grew into as  delightful a romance. A romance indeed is little else  than a fairy-tale for older folk ; and with an eye to the  close kinship between the two the first part of this  book of "Fairy-Gold" tries to show in a new way how  the fairy-tale-tellers and the romancers "swapped" (as  school-boys say) their good things. There you have  a story like that of King Arthur and the Giant of St.  Michael\"s Mount, which comes from that noble old  romancer, Sir Thomas Malory. For a fairy-tale, like a cat,  lias nine lives ; it can pass into many queer shapes, and  l^pet not die. You may cut off its head, or drown it in  sentiment or sea-water, or tie a moral to its tail; but it  will still survive, and be found sitting safe by the fire some  winter night.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>helped me to find new versions of old favourites like " The  Lambton Worm." And using a ballad-monger\"s right, I  have put into its natural shape that other "Laidley" or  "loathly" worm of Spindleston. Every change in these  tales has been made with a real regard for the jealous love  that children feel for their favourites ; and so the literary  touches added by some earlier collectors have been got  rid of here, and the simpler colours of folk-lore and  nursery-lore restored.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>The genuine teller of fairy-tales long ago was an old  woman or gossip of the Mother Goose kind. I am sure  that "Mother Jak," who was nurse to the small prince  who became Edward VI., was one of these. Another  "Mother Jack,\"* formerly cook and housewife at Castle  Fortune, who nursed several of the children, has been  made godmother to the second part of this book. It is  sure and certain that she must have told every tale and  sung every song there put down to her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>This too may be said of her,  she could have told us  many things which, now that she has long been dead,  must remain unexplained for ever. She could have told  you what to do if you were "pixy-led,"  like that west-  countryman " who declared and offered to take his Bible-  oath upon it, that, as sure as ever he was alive to tell it,  whilst his head was running round like a mill-wheel, he  heard with his own ears they bits of Pisgies a-laughing and  2^-tacking their hands, all to see he led-astray, and never  able to find the right road, though he had travelled it  scores of times long agone, by night or by day, as a body  might tell," or she could have told you of that girl, who  once knew a man who, "one night, could not find his  way out of his own fields, all he could do, until he  recollected to turn his coat" The moment he did so, he  heard the Pixies all fly away, up into the trees, and there  they sat and laughed. " Oh ! how they did laugh ! "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='69'>In " Mother Jack\"s Fairy Book," will be found many of  those shorter fairy-fables and stories, which, just because  they are brief, are in danger of being lost sight of alto-  gether. In Part III., which follows, are fairy tales and  poems from some later writers and poets. Among them  will be found Browning\"s "Pied Piper of Hamelin,"  because there is every reason to believe that Hamelin was  as near home as Newtown (Isle of Wight), and that " the  river Weser deep and wide " was the Solent. Of the  stories in the third part, one, "the Defeat of Time," is by  Elia; "Melilot," ** Bacon Pie," and four others are from  the "Oberon\"s Horn" of Henry Morley. And of the  songs and poems, Wordsworth, Keats, Tom Hood, each,  have given you one. It was " Robin " Herrick who wrote  the " Queen Mab " poems and the " Fairy Beggar," that  appear in the first part; and John Lyly who wrote the  "Fairies\" Frolic." "Catskin," in the same part, has  simply made another change of dress, very much as she  does in the story itself. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs=''>E.

He commanded  that Heurodis should be placed upon this white steed, and  thereupon the King of Faerie and his train of knights and  white dames, and Heurodis beside him, rode off through  a fair country with many flowery meads, fields, forests and  pleasant waters, where stood castles and towers amid the  green trees. Fairest of all, on a green terrace overlooking  many orchards and rose-gardens, stood the Faerie King"s  palace.

And when  the time came, there they stood like a ring of living steel  or a hedge of spears, to guard Heurodis.

With its tunes, as he  sang to it, sorrowing for Heurodis, the wild beasts were  enchanted and often came round about him  yea, wolf  and fox, bear and little squirrel  to hear him play.

Other times he saw these  faerie knights and ladies dance, dressed like guisers, with  tabors beating and joyous trumpets blowing. And one  day Orfeo saw sixty lovely ladies ride out to the riverside  for falconry, each with her falcon on her bare hand, and  in the very midst of them (oh wonder !) rode his lost queen,  Heurodis. He determined at once to follow them ; and  after flying their falcons they return through the forest  at evening to a wild rocky place, where they ride into the  rock through a rude cleft, overhung with brambles. They  ride in, a league and more, till they come to the fairest  country ever seen, where it is high midsummer and broad  sunlight. In its midst stands a palace of an hundred  towers, with walls of crystal, and windows coped and  arched with gold. All that land was light, because when  the night should come, the precious stones in the palace  walls gave out a light as bright as noonday. Into this  palace hall Orfeo entered, in the train of the ladies, and  saw there the King of Faerie on his throne. The king  was enraged at first when he saw the strange man enter  with his harp. But Orfeo offers to play upon it, and  Heurodis, when she hears, is filled with longing, while  the Faerie King is so enchanted that he promises to  Orfeo any gift he likes to ask out of all the riches of the  faerie regions.

As it fell out, the  three princesses were talking one night  of whom they would marry. "I will have no one lower  than a king," said the eldest princess. The second  would take a prince or a great duke even. " Pho,  pho," said the youngest, laughing, "you are both so  proud ; now, I would be content with the Black Bull o\"  Norroway." Well, they thought no more of the matter till  the next morning, when, as they sat at breakfast, they  heard the most dreadful bellowing at the door, and what  should it be but the Black Bull come for his bride. You  may be sure they were all terribly frightened at this, for the  Black Bull was one of the most horrible creatures ever  seen in the world. And the king and queen did not know  how to save their daughter. At last they determined to  send him off with the old henwife. So they put her on  his back, and away he went with her till he came to a  great black forest, when, throwing her down, he returned,  roaring louder and more frightfully than ever. They then  sent, one by one, all the servants, then the two eldest  princesses ; but not one of them met with any better treat-  ment than the old henwife, and at last they were forced to  send their youngest and favourite child.</paragraph>

The lord of the castle pressed them to stay, though much  he wondered at the lovely princess and her strange com-  panion. But as they went in among the guests, the  princess espied a pin sticking in the Black Bull"s hide,  which she pulled out, and, to the surprise of all, there  appeared not a frightful wild beast, but one of the most  beautiful princes ever beheld.

She determined, however, to seek  through all the world for him, and many weary ways she  went, but for a long, long while nothing could she hear of  her lover. Travelling once through a dark wood, she lost  her way, and as night was coming on, she thought she  must now certainly die of cold and hunger ; but seeing a  light through the trees, she went on till she came to a  little hut, where an old woman lived, who took her in,  and gave her both food and shelter. In the morning the  old wifie gave her three nuts, that she was not to break  till her heart was " like to break and owre again like to  break " ; so, showing her the way, she bade God speed  her, and the princess once more set out on her wearisome  journey.</paragraph>

At last she came to a castle, where nothing was to be  seen but cooks and bakers, some running one way, and  some another, and all so busy that they did not know  what to do first.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='256'>ONG, long ago,  I cannot say how long,   the young heir of Lambton Castle  led a careless, profane life, regardless  of God and man. All his Saturday  nights he spent in drinking, and all his  Sunday mornings in fishing. One Sun-  day, he had cast his line into the Water  of Wear many times without a bite;  and at last in a rage he let loose his tongue in curses  loud and deep, to the great scandal of the servants and  country folk as they passed by to the old chapel at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sun;line;water;time;bite;rage;tongue;curse;scandal;servant;country;folk;chapel;ford;ruin' adjectives='many;last;loose;loud;deep;great;old' verbs='have;cast;wear;let;pass;be'>Bruge</entity>-  ford, which was not in ruins then.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='257'>Soon afterwards he felt something tugging at his line,  and trusting he had at last hooked a fine fish, he used all  his skill to play it and bring it safe to land. But what  were his horror and dismay on finding that, instead of a  fish he had only caught a loathly worm of most evil  appearance ! He hastily tore the foul thing from his hook,  and flung it into a well close by, which is still known by  the name of the Worm Well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='258'>The young heir had scarcely thrown his line again into  the stream when a stranger of venerable appearance,  passing by, asked him what sport he had met with ?</paragraph>

This was done without delay; the monster approached^  drank the milk, and, without doing further harm, returned  across the Wear to wrap his giant form around his  favourite hill. The next day he was seen recrossing the  river; the trough was hastily filled again, and with the  same results. It was found that the milk of " nine kye \"^  was needed to fill the trough ; and if this quantity was not  placed there every day, regularly and in full measure, the  Worm would break out into a violent rage, lashing its tail  round the trees in the park, and tearing them up by the  roots.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='273'>The Lambton Worm was now, in fact, the terror of the  whole country. Many a knight had come out to fight  with it, but all to no purpose; for it possessed the  marvellous power of reuniting itself after being cut asunder,  and thus was more than a match for all the knighthood of  the North. So, after many a vain conflict, and the loss of  many a brave man, the creature was left in possession of  its favourite hill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='274'>After seven long years, however, the heir of Lambton  returned home, to find the broad lands of his" ancestors  waste and desolate, his people terror-stricken or in hiding,  his father sinking into the grave overwhelmed with care  and anxiety.

There he must meet the Worm face to face,  trusting the issue to Providence and his good sword.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='279'>The heir, now a belted knight, made the vow in Bruge-  ford Chapel. He studded his armour back and breast-plate,  greaves and armlets, with the sharpest spear- heads, and  unsheathing his trusty sword took his stand on the rock in  the middle of the Wear. At the accustomed hour the  Worm uncoiled its " snaky twine," and wound its way  towards the hall, crossing the river close by the rock on  which the knight was standing eager for the combat. He  struck a violent blow upon the monster\"s head as it passed,  on which the creature turned on him, and writhing and  lashing the water in its rage, flung its tail round him, as if  to strangle him in its coils. ^</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='280'>But the closer the Worm wrapped him in its folds the  more deadly were its self-inflicted wounds, till at last  the river ran crimson with its blood. As its strength  diminished, the knight redoubled his strokes, and he was  able at last with his good sword to cut the serpent fold by  fold, and piece by piece asunder; each severed part was  immediately borne away by the swiftness of the current,  and the Worm, unable to reunite itself, was utterly  destroyed.</paragraph>

All was joy  then in hall and chamber; and when  the New Year came, it was kept with  great joy. Rich gifts were given and  many lords and ladies took their seats at the, table, where  Queen Guenever sat at the king"s side, and a lady fairer  of form might no one say he had ever before seen. But  King Arthur would not eat nor would he long sit, until he  should have witnessed some wondrous adventure. The  first course was served with a blowing of trumpets, and  before each two guests were set twelve dishes, and bright  wine, for there was no want of anything. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='390'>u"Scarcely had the first course commenced, when there  rushed in at the hall-door a knight,  the tallest on earth  he must have been. His back and breast were broad,  but his waist was small. He was clothed entirely in green,  and his spurs were of bright gold ; his saddle was em-  broidered with birds and flies, and the steed that he rode  upon was green. Gaily was the knight attired ; his great  beard, like a green bush, hung on his breast. His horse"s  mane was decked with golden threads, and its tail bound  with a green band ; such a horse and such a knight were  never before seen. It seemed that no man might endure  the Green Knight"s blows, but he carried neither spear nor  shield. In one hand he held a holly bough, and in the  other an axe the edge of which was as keen as a sharp  razor, and the handle was encased in iron, curiously graven  with green. "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='394'>Thus arrayed, the Green Knight entered the hall, with-  out saluting anyone ; and asked for the governor of the  company, and looked about him for the most renowned of  them. Much they marvelled to see a man and a horse as  green as grass ; never before had they seen such a sight  as this ; they were afraid to answer, and were as silent as  if sleep had taken hold of them, some from fear, others  from courtesy. King Arthur, who was never afraid, saluted  the Green Knight, and bade him welcome. The Green  Knight said that he would not tarry ; he was seeking the  most valiant, that he might prove him. He came in  peace ; but he had a halberd at home and a helmet too.  King <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;opponent' adjectives='worthy' verbs='assure;fail;find'>Arthur</entity> assured him that he should not fail to find an  opponent worthy of him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='395'>" I seek no fight," said the knight ; " here are only  beardless children ; here is no man to match me ; still, if  any be bold enough to strike a stroke for another, this axe  shall be his, but I shall give him a stroke in return within  a twelvemonth and a day ! "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='396'>Fear kept all silent ; while the knight rolled his red eyes  about and bent his gristly green brows. Waving his beard  awhile, he exclaimed,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>Arthur grew red for shame, and waxed as wroth as the  wind. He assured the knight that no one was afraid of  his great words, and seized the axe. The Green Knight,  stroking his beard, awaited the blow, and with a dry  countenance drew down his green coat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='399'>But thereupon Sir Gawayne begged the king to let him  undertake the blow; he asked permission to leave the  table, saying it was not meet that Arthur should take the  game, while so many bold knights sat upon bench. Al-  though the weakest, he was quite ready to meet the Green  Knight. The other knights too begged Arthur to " give  Gawayne the game." Then the king gave Gawayne, who  was his nephew, his weapon and told him to keep heart and  hand steady. The Green Knight inquired the name of  his opponent, and Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='green;knight;name;opponent;sir;name;ing;blow' adjectives='declar;willing' verbs='inquire;tell;be;give;receive'>Gawayne</entity> told him his name, declar-  ing that he was willing to give and receive a blow.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='408'>And now the Green Knight puts his long, green locks  aside, and lays bare his neck, and Sir Gawayne strikes  hard with the axe, and at one blow severs the head from  the body. The head falls to the earth, and many treat it  roughly, but the Green Knight never falters ; he starts up,  seizes his head, steps into the saddle, holding the while  the head in his hand by the hair, and turns his horse about.  Then lo ! the head lifts up its eyelids, and addresses Sir  Gawayne :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='409'>" Look thou, be ready to go as thou hast promised, and  seek till thou findest me.

But then harvest approaches, and  drives the dust about, and the leaves drop off the trees,  the grass becomes grey, and all ripens and rots. At last,  when the winter winds come round again, Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wind;round;sir;dread;journey;vow;green;knight' adjectives='last' verbs='come;think'>Gawayne</entity>  thinks of his dread journey, and his vow to the Green  Knight.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='422'>Many noble knights, the best of the Court, counsel and  comfort him, and much sorrow prevails in the hall, but  Gawayne declares that he has nothing to fear. On the  mom he asks for his arms; a carpet is spread on the  floor, and he steps thereon. He is dubbed in a doublet  of Tarsic silk, and a well-made hood ; they set steel shoes  on his feet, lap his legs in steel greaves ; put on the steel  habergeon, the well-burnished braces, elbow pieces, and  gloves of plate: while over all is placed the coat armour.  His spurs are then fixed, and his sword is attached to his  side by a silken girdle. Thus attired the knight hears  mass, and afterwards takes leave of Arthur and his Court.  By that time his horse Gringolet was ready, the harness of  which glittered like the gleam of the sun. Then Sir  Gawayne sets his helmet upon his head, and the circle  around it was decked with diamonds ; and they give him  his shield with the "pentangle" of pure gold, devised by  King Solomon as a token of truth ; for it is called the end-  less knot, and well becomes the good Sir Gawayne, a  knight the truest of speech and the fairest of form. He  was found faultless in his five wits; the image of the  Virgin was depicted upon his shield ; in courtesy he was  never found wanting, and therefore was the endless knot  fastened on his shield.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='423'>And now Sir Gawayne seizes his lance and bids all  ^\"Good-day"; he spurs his horse and goes on his way.  All that saw him go, mourned in their hearts, and de-  clared that his equal was not to be found upon earth. It  would have been better for him to have been a leader of  men, than to die by the hands of an elvish man.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='426'>Meanwhile, many a weary mile goes Sir Gawayne ; now  rides the knight through the realms of England ; he has  no companion but his horse, and no men does he see till  he approaches North Wales. From Holyhead he passes  into Wirral, where he finds but few that love God or man ;  he inquires after the Green Knight of the Green Chapel,  but can gain no tidings of him. His cheer oft changed  before he found the chapel ; many a cliff he climbed over,  many a ford and stream he crossed, and everywhere he  found a foe. It were too tedious to tell the tenth part of  his adventures with serpents, wolves and wild men ; with  bulls, bears and boars. Had he not been both brave and  good, doubtless he had been dead ; the sharp winter was  far worse than any war that ever troubled him. Thus in  peril he travels till Christmas Eve and on the morn he  finds himself in a deep forest, where were old oaks many  a hundred ; and many sad birds upon bare twigs piped  piteously for the cold. Through rough ways and deep  mire he goes, that he may celebrate the birth of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='way;mire;birth;blessing;cross;christ' adjectives='rough;deep' verbs='go;celebrate;say;speed'>Christ</entity>  and blessing himself he says, " Cross of Christ, speed me !"</paragraph>

Thereupon is the drawbridge let down,  and the gate opened wide to receive him ; and he enters  and his horse is well stabled, and knights and squires  bring Gawayne into the hall.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='434'>The lord then leads Gawayne to a chamber, and assigns  a page to wait upon him. In this bright bower was noble  bedding ; the curtains were of pure silk with golden hems,  and Tarsic tapestries covered the walls and floor. Here  the knight doffed his armour, and put on rich robes,  which well became him : and in troth a more comely  knight than Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='knight;armour;robe;troth;knight;sir' adjectives='rich;comely' verbs='doff;put;become;be;see'>Gawayne</entity> was never seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='435'>Then a chair was placed by the fireplace for him, and a  mantle of fine linen, richly embroidered, thrown over  him ; a table, too, was brought in, and the knight, having  washed, was invited to sit to meat. He was served with  numerous dishes, with fish baked and broiled, or boiled  and seasoned with spices ; full noble feast, and much  mirth did he make, as he ate and drank.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='436'>Then Sir Gawayne, in answer to his host, told him he  was of Arthur\"s Court ; and when this was made known,  great was the joy in the hall.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>After dinner, the company go to the chapel, to hear the  evensong of the great season. The lord of the castle and  Sir Gawayne sit together during the service. When his  wife, accompanied by her maids, left her seat after the  service, she appeared even fairer than Guenever. An  older dame led her by the hand, and very unlike they  were ; for if the young one was fair, the other was yellow,  and had rough and wrinkled cheeks. The younger had a  throat fairer than snow ; the elder had black brows and  bleared lips. With permission of the lord. Sir Gawayne  salutes the elder, and the younger courteously kisses, and  begs to be her servant.

The prince tells Sir  Gawayne he will teach him the way, and that the Green  Chapel is not more than two miles from the castle. Then  was Gawayne glad, and he consented to tarry awhile at the  castle ; and its lord and castellan rejoiced too, and sent to  ask the ladies to come and entertain their guest.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='570'>Instantly there appeared, as the wood-cutter had fore-  told, a cup-bearer in a crimson dress, bearing in his  hand a drinking-horn. The horn was richly beset with  precious gems ; and the knight was filled with envy at  sight of it. No sooner had he seized upon it, and tasted  of its delicious nectar, which glowed in his veins, than he  determined when he had drained it to make off with  the horn. So, having gotten the horn, and drunk of it  every drop, instead of returning it to the cup-bearer, as in  good manners he should have done, he stepped down  from the knoll, and rudely made off with it in his hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='571'>But, learn ye then what fate overtook this knight that  bore the Wyvern on his shield, but was without true  knighthood, and robbed the Fairy Horn.

But  alas ! the earl did not return it to the fairy-cupbearer, but  gave it to his master and lord, King Henry the Elder.  Since then you may stand all day at the fairy-knoll, and  many times cry " I thirst ! " but you may not taste of the  Fairy Horn.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='574'>LONELY life for the dark and silent  mole ! Day is to her night. She glides  along her narrow vaults, unconscious  of the glad and glorious scenes of  earth and air and sea. She was born,  as it were, in a grave ; and in one  long, living sepulchre she dwells and  dies. Is not existence to her a kind  of doom ? Wherefore is she thus a dark, sad exile from the  blessed light of day ? Hearken !</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='575'>u"Here, in our bleak old Cornwall, the first mole was  once a lady of the land. Her abode was in the far west,  among the hills of Morwenna, beside the Severn Sea.  She was the daughter of a lordly race, the only child of  her mother, and the father of the house was dead : her  name was Alice of the Combe. Fair was she and comely,  tender and tall ; and she stood upon the threshold of her  youth. But most of all did men marvel at the glory of  her large blue eyes. They were, to look upon, like the  summer waters, when the sea is soft with light. They  were to her mother a joy, and to the maiden herself, ah,  benedicite ! a pride. She trusted in the loveliness of those  eyes, and in her face and features and form ; and so it  was that the damsel was wont to pass the whole summer  day in the choice of rich apparel and precious stones and  gold. Howbeit this was one of the ancient and "^ommon  usages of those old departed days. Now, in the fashion  of her stateliness and in the hue and texture of her gar-  ments, there was none among the maidens of old Cornwall  like Alice of the Combe. Men sought her far and near,  but she was to them all, like a form of graven stone,  careless and cold. Her soul was set upon a Granville"s  love, fair Sir Beville of Stowe  the flower of the Cornish  chivalry  that noble gentleman ! That valorous knight ! "</paragraph>

The loyal soldier of  a Stuart king  he was that stately Granville who lived a  hero\"s life and died a warrior\"s death ! He was her star.  Now there was a signal made of banquet in the halls of  Stowe, of wassail and dance. The messenger had sped,  and Alice of the Combe would be there. Robes, precious  and many, were unfolded from their rest, and the casket  poured forth jewel and gem, that the maiden might stand  before the knight victorious. It was the day  the hour   the time  her mother sat at her wheel by the hearth  the  page waited in the hall  she came down in her loveliness,  into the old oak room, and stood before the mirrored  glass  her robe was of woven velvet, rich and glossy and  soft ; jewels shone like stars in the midnight of her raven  hair, and on her hand there gleamed afar off a bright and  glorious ring ! She stood  she gazed upon her own fair  countenance and form, and worshipped ! " Now all good  angels succour thee, my Alice, and bend Sir Beville\"s soul !  Fain am I to greet thee wedded wife before I die ! I do  yearn to hold thy children on my knee ! Often shall 1 pray  to-night that the Granville heart may yield ! Ay, thy  victory shall be thy mother\"s prayer." " Prayer !

They had heard wild tones of mystic music in the air,  there was a rush, a beam of light, and she was gone, and  that for ever ! East sought they her, and west, in northern  parts and south ; but she was never more seen in the land.  Her mother wept till she had not a tear left ; none sought  to comfort her, for it was vain. Moons waxed and  waned, and the crones by the cottage hearth had whiled  away many a shadowy night with tales of Alice of the  Combe. But at the last, as the gardener in the pleasaunce  leaned one day on his spade, he saw among the roses a  small round hillock of earth, such as he had never seen  before, and upon it something which shone. It was her  ring ! It was the very jewel she had worn the day she  vanished out of sight ! They looked earnestly upon it, and</paragraph>

The king, hearing of a rich dame, who  had an only daughter, for the sake of her riches had a  mind to marry her ; and though she was old, ugly, hook-  nosed, and hump-backed, yet all this could not deter  him from doing so. Her daughter was a yellow dowdy,  full of envy and ill-nature; and, in short, was much of  the same mould as her mother. This signified nothing,  for in a few weeks the king, attended by the nobility  and gentry brought his new queen home to his palace.  She had not been long in the Court before she set the  king against his own beautiful daughter, by false reports  and evil tales.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='847'>u"The young princess, having lost her father"s love,  grew weary of the Court, and one day, meeting with  her father in the garden, she desired him, with tears in  her eyes, to give her a small pittance, and she would  go and seek her fortune; to which the king consented,  and ordered her mother-in-law to make up a small sum  according to her discretion. She went to the queen,  who gave her a canvas bag of brown bread and hard  cheese, with a bottle of beer ; though this was but a  very pitiful dowry for a king"s daughter.  E 65 "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='850'>She took it, returned thanks, and proceeded on^ her  journey, passing through groves, woods, and valleys, till  at length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the  mouth of a cave.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='851'>"Good morrow, fair maiden," he said, "whither away  so fast?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='855'>"Yes," said he, "with all my heart."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='856'>With that the lady pulled out her provisions, and bade  him eat and welcome.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='857'>He did so, and gave her many thanks, and then he  said to her : " There is a thick thorny hedge before you,  which will appear impassable, but take this wand in  your hand, strike three times, and say, \" Pray, hedge, let  me come through,\" and it will open immediately; then,  a little further, you will find a well; sit down on  the brink of it, and there will come up three golden  heads, which will speak ; and whatever they require, that  do ! "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='858'>u"Promising she would, she took her leave of him.  Coming to the hedge, she pursued the old man"s direc-  tions; it opened, and gave her a passage; then, coming  to the well, she had no sooner sat down than a golden  head came up singing,  "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='859'>" Wash me, and comb me,  And lay me down softly. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='860'>"Yes," said she, and putting forth her hand, with a  silver comb performed the office, placing it upon a prim-  rose bank.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='861'>Then came up a second and a third head, saying the  same as the former. And again she complied, and then  pulling out her provisions ate her dinner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='862'>Then said the heads one to another, "What shall we  do for this lady who hath used us so kindly ? "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='870'>This done, at their request she let them down into the  well again, and so proceeded on her journey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='871'>She had not travelled long before she saw a king hunt-  ing in the park with his nobles. She would have shunned  him, but the king, having caught a sight of her, approached,  and what with her beauty and grace, was so powerfully  charmed that he fell in love with her at sight. Forthwith  he offered her the finest horse in his train to ride upon ;  and so, bringing her to his palace, he there caused her to  be clothed in the most magnificent manner with white and  gold raiment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='872'>u"This being ended, when the king heard that she w^as  the King of Colchester"s daughter he ordered some  chariots to be got ready, that he might pay her father a  visit. The chariot in which the king and queen rode  was adorned with rich ornamental gems of gold. Her  father was at first astonished that his daughter had been  so fortunate as she was, till the young king made him  sensible of all that happened. Great was the joy at  Court amongst all, with the exception of the queen and  her club-footed daughter, who were ready to burst with  malice and envy of her happiness ; and the greater was  their madness because she was now above them all.  Great rejoicings, with feasting and dancing, continued  many days. Then at length, with the dowry her father  gave her, they returned home. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='873'>The hump-backed sister-in-law, perceiving that her  sister was so happy in seeking her fortune, would needs  do the same ; so, disclosing her mind to her mother,  all preparations were made, and she was furnished not  only with rich apparel, but sugar, almonds, and sweet-  meats, in great quantities, and a large bottle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sister-in-law;sister;fortune;need;mind;mother;preparation;apparel;sugar;almond;meat;quantity;bottle;sack' adjectives='hump-backed;happy;same;rich;sweet;great;large' verbs='perceive;be;seek;do;disclose;be;make;be;furnish'>Malaga</entity>  sack.</paragraph>

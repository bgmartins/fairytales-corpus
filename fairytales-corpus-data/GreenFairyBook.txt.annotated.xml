	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='11'>This is the third, and probably the last, of the Fairy Books of many colours. First there was the Blue Fairy Book; then, children, you asked for more, and we made up the Red Fairy Book; and, when you wanted more still, the Green Fairy Book was put together. The stories in all the books are borrowed from many countries; some are French, some German, some Russian, some Italian, some Scottish, some English, one Chinese. However much these nations differ about trifles, they all agree in liking fairy tales. The reason, no doubt, is that men were much like children in their minds long ago, long, long ago, and so before they took to writing newspapers, and sermons, and novels, and long poems, they told each other stories, such as you read in the fairy books. They believed that witches could turn people into beasts, that beasts could speak, that magic rings could make their owners invisible, and all the other wonders in the stories. Then, as the world became grown-up, the fairy tales which were not written down would have been quite forgotten but that the old grannies remembered them, and told them to the little grandchildren: and when they, in their turn, became grannies, they remembered them, and told them also. In this way these tales are older than reading and writing, far older than printing. The oldest fairy tales ever written down were written down in Egypt, about Joseph"s time, nearly three thousand five hundred years ago. Other fairy stories Homer knew, in Greece, nearly three thousand years ago, and he made them all up into a poem, the Odyssey, which I hope you will read some day. Here you will find the witch who turns men into swine, and the man who bores out the big foolish giant"s eye, and the cap of darkness, and the shoes of swiftness, that were worn later by Jack the Giant-Killer. These fairy tales are the oldest stories in the world, and as they were first made by men who were childlike for their own amusement, so they amuse children still, and also grown-up people who have not forgotten how they once were children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='12'>Some of the stories were made, no doubt, not only to amuse, but to teach goodness. You see, in the tales, how the boy who is kind to beasts, and polite, and generous, and brave, always comes best through his trials, and no doubt these tales were meant to make their hearers kind, unselfish, courteous, and courageous. This is the moral of them. But, after all, we think more as we read them of the diversion than of the lesson. There are grown-up people now who say that the stories are not good for children, because they are not true, because there are no witches, nor talking beasts, and because people are killed in them, especially wicked giants. But probably you who read the tales know very well how much is true and how much is only make-believe, and I never yet heard of a child who killed a very tall man merely because Jack killed the giants, or who was unkind to his stepmother, if he had one, because, in fairy tales, the stepmother is often disagreeable. If there are frightful monsters in fairy tales, they do not frighten you now, because that kind of monster is no longer going about the world, whatever he may have done long, long ago. He has been turned into stone, and you may see his remains in museums. Therefore, I am not afraid that you will be afraid of the magicians and dragons; besides, you see that a really brave boy or girl was always their master, even in the height of their power.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='13'>Some of the tales here, like The Half-Chick, are for very little children; others for older ones. The longest tales, like Heart of Ice, were not invented when the others were, but were written in French, by clever men and women, such as Madame d"Aulnoy, and the Count de Caylus, about two hundred years ago. There are not many people now, perhaps there are none, who can write really good fairy tales, because they do not believe enough in their own stories, and because they want to be wittier than it has pleased <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tale;none;story;fairy;people' adjectives='own;many;good;wittier' verbs='be;want;do;make;please;write;have;believe' valence='6.50882352941' arousal='3.78117647059' dominance='5.89588235294'>Heaven</entity> to make them.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='65'>Once upon a time there lived a King who was immensely rich. He had broad lands, and sacks overflowing with gold and silver; but he did not care a bit for all his riches, because the Queen, his wife, was dead. He shut himself up in a little room and knocked his head against the walls for grief, until his courtiers were really afraid that he would hurt himself. So they hung feather-beds between the tapestry and the walls, and then he could go on knocking his head as long as it was any consolation to him without coming to much harm. All his subjects came to see him, and said whatever they thought would comfort him: some were grave, even gloomy with him; and some agreeable, even gay; but not one could make the least impression upon him. Indeed, he hardly seemed to hear what they said. At last came a lady who was wrapped in a black mantle, and seemed to be in the deepest grief. She wept and sobbed until even the King"s attention was attracted; and when she said that, far from coming to try and diminish his grief, she, who had just lost a good husband, was come to add her tears to his, since she knew what he must be feeling, the King redoubled his lamentations. Then he told the sorrowful lady long stories about the good qualities of his departed Queen, and she in her turn recounted all the virtues of her departed husband; and this passed the time so agreeably that the King quite forgot to thump his head against the feather-beds, and the lady did not need to wipe the tears from her great blue eyes as often as before. By degrees they came to talking about other things in which <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;degree;thing;interest;time;news;lady' adjectives='sorrowful;other;whole;short' verbs='be;marry;take;come;talk;astonish' valence='5.79045454545' arousal='4.08454545455' dominance='5.39681818182'>the King</entity> took an interest, and in a wonderfully short time the whole kingdom was astonished by the news that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;degree;thing;interest;time;news;lady' adjectives='sorrowful;other;whole;short' verbs='be;marry;take;come;talk;astonish' valence='5.79045454545' arousal='4.08454545455' dominance='5.39681818182'>the King</entity> was married again to the sorrowful lady.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='66'>Now the King had one daughter, who was just fifteen years old. Her name was Fiordelisa, and she was the prettiest and most charming Princess imaginable, always gay and merry. The new Queen, who also had a daughter, very soon sent for her to come to the Palace. Turritella, for that was her name, had been brought up by her godmother, the Fairy Mazilla, but in spite of all the care bestowed upon her, she was neither beautiful nor gracious. Indeed, when the Queen saw how ill-tempered and ugly she appeared beside Fiordelisa she was in despair, and did everything in her power to turn the King against his own daughter, in the hope that he might take a fancy to Turritella. One day the King said that it was time Fiordelisa and Turritella were married, so he would give one of them to the first suitable Prince who visited his Court. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='answer' valence='6.31' arousal='4.525' dominance='5.995'>Queen</entity> answered:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='79'>The Queen was in despair, and so was Turritella, when they saw how much the King preferred Fiordelisa. They complained bitterly to the King, and begged and teased him, until he at last consented to have the Princess shut up somewhere out of sight while King Charming"s visit lasted. So that night, as she went to her room, she was seized by four masked figures, and carried up into the topmost room of a high tower, where they left her in the deepest dejection. She easily guessed that she was to be kept out of sight for fear the King should fall in love with her; but then, how disappointing that was, for she already liked him very much, and would have been quite willing to be chosen for his bride! As King Charming did not know what had happened to the Princess, he looked forward impatiently to meeting her again, and he tried to talk about her with the courtiers who were placed in attendance on him. But by the Queen"s orders they would say nothing good of her, but declared that she was vain, capricious, and bad-tempered; that she tormented her waiting-maids, and that, in spite of all the money that the King gave her, she was so mean that she preferred to go about dressed like a poor shepherdess, rather than spend any of it. All these things vexed <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing' adjectives='silent' verbs='be;vex' valence='5.7175' arousal='3.63' dominance='5.7575'>the King</entity> very much, and he was silent.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='82'>King Charming thereupon became so cheerful, and interested in all he said, that it was easy to guess how much he admired the Princess.

A golden true-lover"s knot above the heart bore the motto, "But one can wound me," and the whole jewel was hung upon a chain of immense pearls. Never, since the world has been a world, had such a thing been made, and the King was quite amazed when it was presented to him.

As soon as he possibly could, King Charming went to see the King and Queen, and as he entered the hall he looked for Fiordelisa, and every time anyone came in he started round to see who it was, and was altogether so uneasy and dissatisfied that the Queen saw it plainly. But she would not take any notice, and talked of nothing but the entertainments she was planning.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='91'>The King was terribly angry at being thwarted like this. He felt certain that Turritella was to blame for it, so casting a furious glance at her he abruptly took leave of the Queen, and returned to his own apartments. There he said to a young squire whom he had brought with him: "I would give all I have in the world to gain the good will of one of the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='moment;squire;waiting-woman;will;s;speech;world' adjectives='good;young' verbs='give;obtain;bring;say;gain;have' valence='5.82869565217' arousal='4.22' dominance='5.73826086957'>Princess</entity>"s waiting-women, and obtain a moment"s speech with <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='moment;squire;waiting-woman;will;s;speech;world' adjectives='good;young' verbs='give;obtain;bring;say;gain;have' valence='5.82869565217' arousal='4.22' dominance='5.73826086957'>Fiordelisa</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='92'>"Nothing could be easier," said the young squire; and he very soon made friends with one of the ladies, who told him that in the evening Fiordelisa would be at a little window which looked into the garden, where he could come and talk to her. Only, she said, he must take very great care not to be seen, as it would be as much as her place was worth to be caught helping King Charming to see the Princess. The squire was delighted, and promised all she asked; but the moment he had run off to announce his success to the King, the false waiting-woman went and told the Queen all that had passed. She at once determined that her own daughter should be at the little window; and she taught her so well all she was to say and do, that even the stupid <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='window;daughter;mistake' adjectives='little;own;stupid' verbs='be;do;make;say;determine;teach' valence='5.63916666667' arousal='4.04333333333' dominance='5.63916666667'>Turritella</entity> could make no mistake.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='93'>The night was so dark that the King had not a chance of finding out the trick that was being played upon him, so he approached the window with the greatest delight, and said everything that he had been longing to say to Fiordelisa to persuade her of his love for her. Turritella answered as she had been taught, that she was very unhappy, and that there was no chance of her being better treated by the Queen until her daughter was married. And then the King entreated her to marry him; and thereupon he drew his ring from his finger and put it upon Turritella"s, and she answered him as well as she could. The King could not help thinking that she did not say exactly what he would have expected from his darling Fiordelisa, but he persuaded himself that the fear of being surprised by the Queen was making her awkward and unnatural. He would not leave her until she had promised to see him again the next night, which Turritella did willingly enough. The Queen was overjoyed at the success of her stratagem, end promised herself that all would now be as she wished; and sure enough, as soon as it was dark the following night the King came, bringing with him a chariot which had been given him by an Enchanter who was his friend. This chariot was drawn by flying frogs, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chariot;frog' adjectives='' verbs='fly;be;draw;mount;cry;persuade;let;put;come' valence='5.61' arousal='3.99083333333' dominance='5.575'>the King</entity> easily persuaded <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chariot;frog' adjectives='' verbs='fly;be;draw;mount;cry;persuade;let;put;come' valence='5.61' arousal='3.99083333333' dominance='5.575'>Turritella</entity> to come out and let him put her into it, then mounting beside her he cried triumphantly--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>As soon as the transformation was complete the King uttered a dolorous cry and fled through the open window, pursued by the mocking laughter of Turritella and the Fairy Mazilla.

"Alas! in seven years who knows what may happen to my darling Fiordelisa!" he said. "Her cruel stepmother may have married her to someone else before I am myself again, and then what good will life be to me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='112'>In the meantime the Fairy Mazilla had sent Turritella back to the Queen, who was all anxiety to know how the wedding, had gone off. But when her daughter arrived and told her all that had happened she was terribly angry, and of course all her wrath fell upon Fiordelisa. "She shall have cause to repent that the King admires her," said the Queen, nodding her head meaningly, and then she and Turritella went up to the little room in the tower where the Princess was imprisoned. Fiordelisa was immensely surprised to see that Turritella was wearing a royal mantle and a diamond crown, and her heart sank when the Queen said: "My daughter is come to show you some of her wedding presents, for she is King Charming"s bride, and they are the happiest pair in the world, he loves her to distraction." All this time Turritella was spreading out lace, and jewels, and rich brocades, and ribbons before Fiordelisa"s unwilling eyes, and taking good care to display King Charming"s ring, which she wore upon her thumb. The Princess recognised it as soon as her eyes fell upon it, and after that she could no longer doubt that he had indeed married Turritella. In despair she cried, "Take away these miserable gauds! what pleasure has a wretched captive in the sight of them?" and then she fell insensible upon the floor, and the cruel Queen laughed maliciously, and went away with Turritella, leaving her there without comfort or aid. That night the Queen said to the King, that his daughter was so infatuated with King Charming, in spite of his never having shown any preference for her, that it was just as well she should stay in the tower until she came to her senses. To which he answered that it was her affair, and she could give what orders she pleased about the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='affair;order' adjectives='' verbs='answer;be;please;give' valence='6.34142857143' arousal='4.32285714286' dominance='6.02857142857'>Princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>When the unhappy Fiordelisa recovered, and remembered all she had just heard, she began to cry bitterly, believing that King Charming was lost to her for ever, and all night long she sat at her open window sighing and lamenting; but when it was dawn she crept away into the darkest corner of her little room and sat there, too unhappy to care about anything. As soon as night came again she once more leaned out into the darkness and bewailed her miserable lot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>Now it happened that King Charming, or rather the Blue Bird, had been flying round the palace in the hope of seeing his beloved Princess, but had not dared to go too near the windows for fear of being seen and recognised by Turritella. When night fell he had not succeeded in discovering where Fiordelisa was imprisoned, and, weary and sad, he perched upon a branch of a tall fir tree which grew close to the tower, and began to sing himself to sleep. But soon the sound of a soft voice lamenting attracted his attention, and listening intently he heard it say--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='125'>But the Blue Bird did not long stay in his hiding-place.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='126'>"Promise me that you will wear it always!" said the Blue Bird. And the Princess promised on condition that he should come and see her in the day as well as by night. They talked all night long, and the next morning the Blue Bird flew off to his kingdom, and crept into his palace through the broken window, and chose from his treasures two bracelets, each cut out of a single emerald. When he presented them to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head' adjectives='' verbs='say;present;shake' valence='6.17' arousal='4.864' dominance='6.24'>Princess</entity>, she shook her head at him reproachfully, saying--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='129'>"No, my Princess; but I love you so much that I feel I cannot express it, try as I may. I only bring you these worthless trifles to show that I have not ceased to think of you, though I have been obliged to leave you for a time."

The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='little' verbs='see;say;laugh' valence='6.03' arousal='4.975' dominance='5.81'>Princess</entity> laughed a little when she saw it, and said--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='131'>"Ah, Princess, they cannot seem so long to you as they do to me!" he answered. Day by day he brought more beautiful things for the Princess--diamonds, and rubies, and opals; and at night she decked herself with them to please him, but by day she hid them in her straw mattress. When the sun shone the Blue Bird, hidden in the tall fir-tree, sang to her so sweetly that all the passersby wondered, and said that the wood was inhabited by a spirit. And so two years slipped away, and still the Princess was a prisoner, and Turritella was not married. The Queen had offered her hand to all the neighbouring Princes, but they always answered that they would marry Fiordelisa with pleasure, but not Turritella on any account. This displeased the Queen terribly. "Fiordelisa must be in league with them, to annoy me!" she said. "Let us go and accuse her of it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='132'>So she and Turritella went up into the tower. Now it happened that it was nearly midnight, and Fiordelisa, all decked with jewels, was sitting at the window with the Blue Bird, and as the Queen paused outside the door to listen she heard the Princess and her lover singing together a little song he had just taught her. These were the words:--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='140'>They sound melancholy perhaps, but the two voices sang them gaily enough, and the Queen burst open the door, crying, "Ah! my Turritella, there is some treachery going on here!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='149'>"That"s all very fine," said the Queen suspiciously. "I think I will look about, and see for myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='150'>So she and Turritella began to search every corner of the little room, and when they came to the straw mattress out fell such a quantity of pearls, diamonds, rubies, opals, emeralds, and sapphires, that they were amazed, and could not tell what to think. But the Queen resolved to hide somewhere a packet of false letters to prove that the Princess had been conspiring with the King"s enemies, and she chose the chimney as a good place. Fortunately for Fiordelisa this was exactly where the Blue Bird had perched himself, to keep an eye upon her proceedings, and try to avert danger from his beloved <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='proceedings;eye;fiordelisa;danger' adjectives='beloved' verbs='be;avert;perch;cry;keep;try;have' valence='5.705' arousal='4.24785714286' dominance='5.32357142857'>Princess</entity>, and now he cried:</paragraph>

Very soon, with all the care and attention they bestowed upon her, she recovered from the effects of her long captivity and looked more beautiful than ever, and was able to take counsel with her courtiers, and arrange for the governing of her kingdom during her absence. And then, taking a bagful of jewels, she set out all alone to look for the Blue Bird, without telling anyone where she was going.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='188'>Meanwhile, the Enchanter was taking care of King Charming, but as his power was not great enough to counteract the Fairy Mazilla"s, he at last resolved to go and see if he could make any kind of terms with her for his friend; for you see, Fairies and Enchanters are cousins in a sort of way, after all; and after knowing one another for five or six hundred years and falling out, and making it up again pretty often, they understand one another well enough.

Once the nail on which his cage was hung had given way, and his feathered Majesty had suffered much from the fall, while Madam Puss, who happened to be in the room at the time, had given him a scratch in the eye which came very near blinding him. Another time they had forgotten to give him any water to drink, so that he was nearly dead with thirst; and the worst thing of all was that he was in danger of losing his kingdom, for he had been absent so long that all his subjects believed him to be dead.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='194'>Meanwhile, Queen Fiordelisa, disguised as a poor peasant girl, wearing a great straw hat that concealed her face, and carrying an old sack over her shoulder, had set out upon her weary journey, and had travelled far, sometimes by sea and sometimes by land; sometimes on foot, and sometimes on horseback, but not knowing which way to go. She feared all the time that every step she took was leading her farther from her lover. One day as she sat, quite tired and sad, on the bank of a little brook, cooling her white feet in the clear running water, and combing her long hair that glittered like gold in the sunshine, a little bent old woman passed by, leaning on a stick. She stopped, and said to Fiordelisa:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='195'>"What, my pretty child, are you all alone?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='196'>"Indeed, good mother, I am too sad to care for company," she answered; and the tears ran down her cheeks.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='197'>"Don"t cry," said the old woman, "but tell me truly what is the matter. Perhaps I can help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='198'>The Queen told her willingly all that had happened, and how she was seeking the Blue Bird. Thereupon the little old woman suddenly stood up straight, and grew tall, and young, and beautiful, and said with a smile to the astonished Fiordelisa:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='199'>"Lovely Queen, the King whom you seek is no longer a bird. My sister Mazilla has given his own form back to him, and he is in his own kingdom. Do not be afraid, you will reach him, and will prosper. Take these four eggs; if you break one when you are in any great difficulty, you will find aid."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='200'>So saying, she disappeared, and Fiordelisa, feeling much encouraged, put the eggs into her bag and turned her steps towards Charming"s kingdom. After walking on and on for eight days and eight nights, she came at last to a tremendously high hill of polished ivory, so steep that it was impossible to get a foothold upon it. Fiordelisa tried a thousand times, and scrambled and slipped, but always in the end found herself exactly where she started from. At last she sat down at the foot of it in despair, and then suddenly bethought herself of the eggs. Breaking one quickly, she found in it some little gold hooks, and with these fastened to her feet and hands, she mounted the ivory hill without further trouble, for the little hooks saved her from slipping. As soon as she reached the top a new difficulty presented itself, for all the other side, and indeed the whole valley, was one polished mirror, in which thousands and thousands of people were admiring their reflections. For this was a magic mirror, in which people saw themselves just as they wished to appear, and pilgrims came to it from the four corners of the world. But nobody had ever been able to reach the top of the hill, and when they saw Fiordelisa standing there, they raised a terrible outcry, declaring that if she set foot upon their glass she would break it to pieces. The Queen, not knowing what to do, for she saw it would be dangerous to try to go down, broke the second egg, and out came a chariot, drawn by two white doves, and Fiordelisa got into it, and was floated softly away. After a night and a day the doves alighted outside the gate of King Charming"s kingdom. Here the Queen got out of the chariot, and kissed the doves and thanked them, and then with a beating heart she walked into the town, asking the people she met where she could see the King. But they only laughed at her, crying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='201'>"See the King? And pray, why do you want to see the King, my little kitchen-maid? You had better go and wash your face first, your eyes are not clear enough to see him!" For the Queen had disguised herself, and pulled her hair down about her eyes, that no one might know her. As they would not tell her, she went on farther, and presently asked again, and this time the people answered that to-morrow she might see the King driving through the streets with the Princess Turritella, as it was said that at last he had consented to marry her. This was indeed terrible news to Fiordelisa.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='244'>The King was very much puzzled when he heard this. How could the lovely Princess Fiordelisa be a little kitchen-maid? or how could a little kitchen-maid have Fiordelisa"s own voice? So he dressed hastily, and ran down a little secret staircase which led to the Chamber of Echoes. There, upon a heap of soft cushions, sat his lovely Princess. She had laid aside all her ugly disguises and wore a white silken robe, and her golden hair shone in the soft lamp-light. The King was overjoyed at the sight, and rushed to throw himself at her feet, and asked her a thousand questions without giving her time to answer one. Fiordelisa was equally happy to be with him once more, and nothing troubled them but the remembrance of the Fairy Mazilla. But at this moment in came the Enchanter, and with him a famous Fairy, the same in fact who had given Fiordelisa the eggs. After greeting the King and Queen, they said that as they were united in wishing to help King Charming, the Fairy Mazilla had no longer any power against him, and he might marry Fiordelisa as soon as he pleased. The King"s joy may be imagined, and as soon as it was day the news was spread through the palace, and everybody who saw Fiordelisa loved her directly. When Turritella heard what had happened she came running to the King, and when she saw Fiordelisa with him she was terribly angry, but before she could say a word the Enchanter and the Fairy changed her into a big brown owl, and she floated away out of one of the palace windows, hooting dismally.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='250'>Once upon a time there was a handsome black Spanish hen, who had a large brood of chickens. They were all fine, plump little birds, except the youngest, who was quite unlike his brothers and sisters. Indeed, he was such a strange, queer-looking creature, that when he first chipped his shell his mother could scarcely believe her eyes, he was so different from the twelve other fluffy, downy, soft little chicks who nestled under her wings. This one looked just as if he had been cut in two. He had only one leg, and one wing, and one eye, and he had half a head and half a beak. His mother shook her head sadly as she looked at him and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='251'>"My youngest born is only a half-chick. He can never grow up a tall handsome cock like his brothers. They will go out into the world and rule over poultry yards of their own; but this poor little fellow will always have to stay at home with his mother." And she called him Medio Pollito, which is Spanish for half-chick.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='252'>Now though Medio Pollito was such an odd, helpless-looking little thing, his mother soon found that he was not at all willing to remain under her wing and protection. Indeed, in character he was as unlike his brothers and sisters as he was in appearance. They were good, obedient chickens, and when the old hen chicked after them, they chirped and ran back to her side. But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='coop;spite;leg;mother;ear;spirit' adjectives='roving' verbs='hear;return;pretend;call;have' valence='5.98785714286' arousal='3.70642857143' dominance='5.76857142857'>Medio Pollito</entity> had a roving spirit in spite of his one leg, and when his mother called to him to return to the coop, he pretended that he could not hear, because he had only one ear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='253'>When she took the whole family out for a walk in the fields, Medio Pollito would hop away by himself, and hide among the Indian corn. Many an anxious minute his brothers and sisters had looking for him, while his mother ran to and fro cackling in fear and dismay.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='254'>As he grew older he became more self-willed and disobedient, and his manner to his mother was often very rude, and his temper to the other chickens very disagreeable.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='255'>One day he had been out for a longer expedition than usual in the fields. On his return he strutted up to his mother with the peculiar little hop and kick which was his way of walking, and cocking his one eye at her in a very bold way he said:</paragraph>

When he entered the town he saw before him a great splendid house, with soldiers standing before the gates. This he knew must be the King"s palace, and he determined to hop up to the front gate and wait there until the King came out.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='285'>Caliph Chasid, of Bagdad, was resting comfortably on his divan one fine afternoon. He was smoking a long pipe, and from time to time he sipped a little coffee which a slave handed to him, and after each sip he stroked his long beard with an air of enjoyment. In short, anyone could see that the Caliph was in an excellent humour. This was, in fact, the best time of day in which to approach him, for just now he was pretty sure to be both affable and in good spirits, and for this reason the Grand Vizier Mansor always chose this hour in which to pay his daily visit.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='286'>He arrived as usual this afternoon, but, contrary to his usual custom, with an anxious face. The Caliph withdrew his pipe for a moment from his lips and asked, "Why do you look so anxious, Grand Vizier?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='289'>The Caliph, who had wished for some time past to give his Grand Vizier a present, ordered his black slave to bring the pedlar before him at once. The slave soon returned, followed by the pedlar, a short stout man with a swarthy face, and dressed in very ragged clothes. He carried a box containing all manner of wares--strings of pearls, rings, richly mounted pistols, goblets, and combs. The Caliph and his Vizier inspected everything, and the Caliph chose some handsome pistols for himself and Mansor, and a jewelled comb for the Vizier"s wife. Just as the pedlar was about to close his box, the Caliph noticed a small drawer, and asked if there was anything else in it for sale. The pedlar opened the drawer and showed them a box containing a black powder, and a scroll written in strange characters, which neither the Caliph nor the Mansor could read.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='290'>"I got these two articles from a merchant who had picked them up in the street at Mecca," said the pedlar. "I do not know what they may contain, but as they are of no use to me, you are welcome to have them for a trifle."</paragraph>

When he wishes to resume the human form, he has only to bow three times towards the east, and to repeat the same word.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='298'>When Selim the learned had read this, the Caliph was delighted. He made the wise man swear not to tell the matter to anyone, gave him a splendid robe, and dismissed him. Then he said to his Vizier, "That"s what I call a good bargain, Mansor.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='300'>Next morning Caliph Chasid had barely finished dressing, and breakfasting, when the Grand Vizier arrived, according to orders, to accompany him in his expedition. The Caliph stuck the snuff-box in his girdle, and, having desired his servants to remain at home, started off with the Grand Vizier only in attendance. First they walked through the palace gardens, but they looked in vain for some creature which could tempt them to try their magic power. At length the Vizier suggested going further on to a pond which lay beyond <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='variety;attention;appearance;stork;length;pond;chatter;grave;creature' adjectives='constant;dignified' verbs='suggest;see;lay;have;go;attract' valence='5.779' arousal='4.098' dominance='5.643'>the town</entity>, and where he had often seen a variety of creatures, especially storks, whose grave, dignified appearance and constant chatter had often attracted his attention.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='301'>The Caliph consented, and they went straight to the pond. As soon as they arrived they remarked a stork strutting up and down with a stately air, hunting for frogs, and now and then muttering something to itself. At the same time they saw another stork far above in the sky flying towards the same spot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='302'>"I would wager my beard, most gracious master," said the Grand Vizier, "that these two long legs will have a good chat together. How would it be if we turned ourselves into storks?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='303'>"Well said," replied the Caliph; "but first let us remember carefully how we are to become men once more. True! Bow three times towards the east and say "Mutabor!" and I shall be Caliph and you my Grand Vizier again. But for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sake;s;t;laugh' adjectives='' verbs='be;don;lose' valence='5.57857142857' arousal='4.65571428571' dominance='5.30428571429'>Heaven</entity>"s sake don"t laugh or we are lost!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='304'>As the Caliph spoke he saw the second stork circling round his head and gradually flying towards the earth. Quickly he drew the box from his girdle, took a good pinch of the snuff, and offered one to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='box;girdle;mutabor;snuff;pinch' adjectives='good' verbs='draw;cry;take;offer' valence='5.08692307692' arousal='3.9' dominance='5.02538461538'>Mansor</entity>, who also took one, and both cried together "Mutabor!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='305'>Instantly their legs shrivelled up and grew thin and red; their smart yellow slippers turned to clumsy stork"s feet, their arms to wings; their necks began to sprout from between their shoulders and grew a yard long; their beards disappeared, and their bodies were covered with feathers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='306'>"You"ve got a fine long bill, Sir Vizier," cried the Caliph, after standing for some time lost in astonishment. "By the beard of the Prophet I never saw such a thing in all my life!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='307'>"My very humble thanks," replied the Grand Vizier, as he bent his long neck; "but, if I may venture to say so, your Highness is even handsomer as a stork than as a Caliph. But come, if it so pleases you, let us go near our comrades there and find out whether we really do understand the language of storks."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='308'>Meantime the second stork had reached the ground. It first scraped its bill with its claw, stroked down its feathers, and then advanced towards the first stork. The two newly made storks lost no time in drawing near, and to their amazement overheard the following conversation:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='309'>"Good morning, Dame Longlegs. You are out early this morning!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>"Yes, indeed, dear Chatterbill! I am getting myself a morsel of breakfast. May I offer you a joint of lizard or a frog"s thigh?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='312'>Thereupon the young stork began to move about with the most wonderful steps. The Caliph and Mansor looked on in surprise for some time; but when at last she balanced herself in a picturesque attitude on one leg, and flapped her wings gracefully up and down, they could hold out no longer; a prolonged peal burst from each of their bills, and it was some time before they could recover their composure. The Caliph was the first to collect himself. "That was the best joke," said he, "I"ve ever seen. It"s a pity the stupid creatures were scared away by our laughter, or no doubt they would have sung next!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='313'>Suddenly, however, the Vizier remembered how strictly they had been warned not to laugh during their transformation. He at once communicated his fears to the Caliph, who exclaimed, "By Mecca and Medina! it would indeed prove but a poor joke if I had to remain a stork for the remainder of my days! Do just try and remember the stupid word, it has slipped my memory."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='314'>"We must bow three times eastwards and say "Mu...mu...mu...""</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='315'>They turned to the east and fell to bowing till their bills touched the ground, but, oh horror--the magic word was quite forgotten, and however often the Caliph bowed and however touchingly his Vizier cried "Mu...mu..." they could not recall it, and the unhappy Chasid and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chasid;stork;caliph;word;horror;bill;mu;vizier;ground' adjectives='east;magic;unhappy' verbs='be;forget;recall;cry;bow;turn;remain;fall;touch' valence='4.97444444444' arousal='4.15944444444' dominance='5.03833333333'>Mansor</entity> remained storks as they were.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='318'>So they lounged about for several days, supporting themselves on fruits, which, however, they found some difficulty in eating with their long bills. They did not much care to eat frogs or lizards.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='319'>During the first few days they noticed signs of much disturbance and distress in the streets, but about the fourth day, as they sat on the roof of the palace, they perceived a splendid procession passing below them along the street.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='320'>The two storks on the palace roof looked at each other, and Caliph Chasid said, "Can you guess now, Grand Vizier, why I have been enchanted? This Mirza is the son of my deadly enemy, the mighty magician Kaschnur, who in an evil moment vowed vengeance on me. Still I will not despair! Come with me, my faithful friend; we will go to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='prophet;spell;spot;faithful;friend' adjectives='sacred' verbs='go;be;loose;come' valence='5.66' arousal='3.97928571429' dominance='5.59928571429'>the grave</entity> of the Prophet, and perhaps at that sacred spot the spell may be loosed."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='322'>But flying was not quite an easy matter, for the two storks had had but little practice as yet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='323'>"Oh, my Lord!" gasped the Vizier, after a couple of hours, "I can get on no longer; you really fly too quick for me. Besides, it is nearly evening, and we should do well to find some place in which to spend the night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='324'>Chasid listened with favour to his servant"s suggestion, and perceiving in the valley beneath them a ruin which seemed to promise shelter they flew towards it. The building in which they proposed to pass the night had apparently been formerly a castle. Some handsome pillars still stood amongst the heaps of ruins, and several rooms, which yet remained in fair preservation, gave evidence of former splendour. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='passage;spot;companion' adjectives='dry' verbs='seek;wander;stand' valence='5.69125' arousal='3.69625' dominance='5.61375'>Chasid</entity> and his companion wandered along the passages seeking a dry spot, when suddenly <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='passage;spot;companion' adjectives='dry' verbs='seek;wander;stand' valence='5.69125' arousal='3.69625' dominance='5.61375'>Mansor</entity> stood still.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='325'>"My Lord and master," he whispered, "if it were not absurd for a Grand Vizier, and still more for a stork, to be afraid of ghosts, I should feel quite nervous, for someone, or something close by me, has sighed and moaned quite audibly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='326'>The Caliph stood still and distinctly heard a low weeping sound which seemed to proceed from a human being rather than from any animal. Full of curiosity he was about to rush towards the spot from whence the sounds of woe came, when the Vizier caught him by the wing with his bill, and implored him not to expose himself to fresh and unknown dangers. The Caliph, however, under whose stork"s breast a brave heart beat, tore himself away with the loss of a few feathers, and hurried down a dark passage. He saw a door which stood ajar, and through which he distinctly heard sighs, mingled with sobs. He pushed open the door with his bill, but remained on the threshold, astonished at the sight which met his eyes. On the floor of the ruined chamber--which was but scantily lighted by a small barred window--sat a large screech owl. Big tears rolled from its large round eyes, and in a hoarse voice it uttered its complaints through its crooked beak. As soon as it saw the Caliph and his Vizier--who had crept up meanwhile--it gave vent to a joyful cry. It gently wiped the tears from its eyes with its spotted brown wings, and to the great amazement of the two visitors, addressed them in good human Arabic.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='327'>"Welcome, ye storks! You are a good sign of my deliverance, for it was foretold me that a piece of good fortune should befall me through a stork."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='328'>When the Caliph had recovered from his surprise, he drew up his feet into a graceful position, bent his long neck, and said: "Oh, screech owl! from your words I am led to believe that we see in you a companion in misfortune. But, alas! your hope that you may attain your deliverance through us is but a vain one. You will know our helplessness when you have heard our story."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='329'>The screech owl begged him to relate it, and the Caliph accordingly told him what we already know.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='330'>IV.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='331'>When the Caliph had ended, the owl thanked him and said: "You hear my story, and own that I am no less unfortunate than yourselves. My father is the King of the Indies. I, his only daughter, am named Lusa. That magician Kaschnur, who enchanted you, has been the cause of my misfortunes too. He came one day to my father and demanded my hand for his son Mirza. My father--who is rather hasty--ordered him to be thrown downstairs. The wretch not long after managed to approach me under another form, and one day, when I was in the garden, and asked for some refreshment, he brought me--in the disguise of a slave--a draught which changed me at once to this horrid shape. Whilst I was fainting with terror he transported me here, and cried to me with his awful voice: "There shall you remain, lonely and hideous, despised even by the brutes, till the end of your days, or till some one of his own free will asks you to be his wife. Thus do I avenge myself on you and your proud father."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='332'>"Since then many months have passed away. Sad and lonely do I live like any hermit within these walls, avoided by the world and a terror even to animals; the beauties of nature are hidden from me, for I am blind by day, and it is only when the moon sheds her pale light on this spot that the veil falls from my eyes and I can see." The owl paused, and once more wiped her eyes with her wing, for the recital of her woes had drawn fresh tears from her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='333'>The Caliph fell into deep thought on hearing this story of the Princess. "If I am not much mistaken," said he, "there is some mysterious connection between our misfortunes, but how to find the key to the riddle is the question."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='334'>The owl answered: "Oh, my Lord! I too feel sure of this, for in my earliest youth a wise woman foretold that a stork would bring me some great happiness, and I think I could tell you how we might save ourselves." The Caliph was much surprised, and asked her what she meant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='335'>"The Magician who has made us both miserable," said she, "comes once a month to these ruins. Not far from this room is a large hall where he is in the habit of feasting with his companions. I have often watched them. They tell each other all about their evil deeds, and possibly the magic word which you have forgotten may be mentioned."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='336'>"Oh, dearest Princess!" exclaimed the Caliph, "say, when does he come, and where is <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='caliph' adjectives='' verbs='do;exclaim;come;say;be' valence='5.806' arousal='3.534' dominance='5.778'>the hall</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='337'>The owl paused a moment and then said: "Do not think me unkind, but I can only grant your request on one condition."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='338'>"Speak, speak!" cried Chasid; "command, I will gladly do whatever you wish!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='339'>"Well," replied the owl, "you see I should like to be free too; but this can only be if one of you will offer me his hand in marriage."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='340'>The storks seemed rather taken aback by this suggestion, and the Caliph beckoned to his Vizier to retire and consult with him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='341'>When they were outside the door the Caliph said: "Grand Vizier, this is a tiresome business. However, you can take her."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='342'>"Indeed!" said the Vizier; "so that when I go home my wife may scratch my eyes out! Besides, I am an old man, and your Highness is still young and unmarried, and a far more suitable match for a young and lovely <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='highness;match;man' adjectives='lovely;unmarried;suitable;old;young' verbs='be' valence='5.65375' arousal='4.336875' dominance='5.564375'>Princess</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='343'>"That"s just where it is," sighed the Caliph, whose wings drooped in a dejected manner; "how do you know she is young and lovely? I call it buying a pig in a poke."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='344'>They argued on for some time, but at length, when the Caliph saw plainly that his Vizier would rather remain a stork to the end of his days than marry the owl, he determined to fulfil the condition himself. The owl was delighted. She owned that they could not have arrived at a better time, as most probably the magicians would meet that very night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='345'>She then proceeded to lead the two storks to the chamber. They passed through a long dark passage till at length a bright ray of light shone before them through the chinks of a half-ruined wall. When they reached it the owl advised them to keep very quiet. Through the gap near which they stood they could with ease survey the whole of the large hall. It was adorned with splendid carved pillars; a number of coloured lamps replaced the light of day. In the middle of the hall stood a round table covered with a variety of dishes, and about the table was a divan on which eight men were seated. In one of these bad men the two recognised the pedlar who had sold the magic powder. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='vizier;doings;caliph;story' adjectives='latest;next' verbs='relate;beg;tell' valence='5.546' arousal='4.006' dominance='4.976'>The man</entity> next him begged him to relate all his latest doings, and amongst them he told the story of the Caliph and his Vizier.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='346'>"And what kind of word did you give them?" asked another old sorcerer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='347'>"A very difficult Latin word; it is "Mutabor.""</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='348'>V.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='349'>As soon as the storks heard this they were nearly beside themselves with joy. They ran at such a pace to the door of the ruined castle that the owl could scarcely keep up with them. When they reached it the Caliph turned to the owl, and said with much feeling: "Deliverer of my friend and myself, as a proof of my eternal gratitude, accept me as your husband." Then he turned towards the east. Three times the storks bowed their long necks to the sun, which was just rising over the mountains. "Mutabor!" they both cried, and in an instant they were once more transformed. In the rapture of their newly-given lives master and servant fell laughing and weeping into each other"s arms. Who shall describe their surprise when they at last turned round and beheld standing before them a beautiful lady exquisitely dressed!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='350'>With a smile she held out her hand to the Caliph, and asked: "Do you not recognise your screech owl?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='351'>It was she! The Caliph was so enchanted by her grace and beauty, that he declared being turned into a stork had been the best piece of luck which had ever befallen him. The three set out at once for Bagdad. Fortunately, the Caliph found not only the box with the magic powder, but also his purse in his girdle; he was, therefore, able to buy in the nearest village all they required for their journey, and so at last they reached the gates of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='box;caliph;girdle;purse;journey;powder;village;gate' adjectives='able;magic;last;nearest' verbs='be;require;buy;reach;find' valence='5.87' arousal='3.86714285714' dominance='5.70928571429'>Bagdad</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='352'>Here the Caliph"s arrival created the greatest sensation. He had been quite given up for dead, and the people were greatly rejoiced to see their beloved ruler again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='353'>Their rage with the usurper Mirza, however, was great in proportion. They marched in force to the palace and took the old magician and his son prisoners. The Caliph sent the magician to the room where the Princess had lived as an owl, and there had him hanged. As the son, however, knew nothing of his father"s acts, the Caliph gave him his choice between death and a pinch of the magic snuff. When he chose the latter, the Grand Vizier handed him the box. One good pinch, and the magic word transformed him to a stork. The Caliph ordered him to be confined in an iron cage, and placed in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='caliph;cage;garden;iron' adjectives='' verbs='be;confine;place;order' valence='5.26111111111' arousal='3.88' dominance='5.33777777778'>the palace</entity> gardens.</paragraph>

The young man promised to do his best, and his conduct during three years was all that it should be.

The king will ask what you would like in return, and be sure you beg for the watch which hangs on the wall. It has all sorts of wonderful properties, you only need to rub it to get whatever you like."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>No sooner said than done. Jenik became the master of the watch, and the moment he got out he wished to put its virtues to the proof. He was hungry, and thought it would be delightful to eat in the meadow a loaf of new bread and a steak of good beef washed down by a flask of wine, so he scratched the watch, and in an instant it was all before him. Imagine his joy!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='367'>Evening soon came, and Jenik rubbed his watch, and thought it would be very pleasant to have a room with a comfortable bed and a good supper. In an instant they were all before him. After supper he went to bed and slept till morning, as every honest man ought to do. Then he set forth for his father"s house, his mind dwelling on the feast that would be awaiting him. But as he returned in the same old clothes in which he went away, his father flew into a great rage, and refused to do anything for him. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stove;ash;place;anybody;minding' adjectives='old' verbs='go;dirty' valence='4.834' arousal='4.346' dominance='5.442'>Jenik</entity> went to his old place near the stove, and dirtied himself in the ashes without anybody minding.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='368'>The third day, feeling rather dull, he thought it would be nice to see a three-story house filled with beautiful furniture, and with vessels of silver and gold. So he rubbed the watch, and there it all was. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='feast;father;plate' adjectives='welcome' verbs='look;give;offer;show;say;let;permit;go;come' valence='5.99705882353' arousal='4.04764705882' dominance='5.63235294118'>Jenik</entity> went to look for his father, and said to him: "You offered me no feast of welcome, but permit me to give one to you, and come and let me show you my plate."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='369'>The father was much astonished, and longed to know where his son had got all this wealth. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='relation;banquet;friend' adjectives='grand' verbs='do;beg;invite;reply' valence='5.66444444444' arousal='4.31444444444' dominance='5.70222222222'>Jenik</entity> did not reply, but begged him to invite all their relations and friends to a grand banquet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='370'>So the father invited all the world, and everyone was amazed to see such splendid things, so much plate, and so many fine dishes on the table. After the first course Jenik prayed his father to invite the King, and his daughter the Princess. He rubbed his watch and wished for a carriage ornamented with gold and silver, and drawn by six horses, with harness glittering with precious stones. The father did not dare to sit in this gorgeous coach, but went to the palace on foot. The King and his daughter were immensely surprised with the beauty of the carriage, and mounted the steps at once to go to Jenik"s banquet. Then Jenik rubbed his watch afresh, and wished that for six miles the way to the house should be paved with marble. Who ever felt so astonished as the King? Never had he travelled over such a gorgeous road.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='371'>When Jenik heard the wheels of the carriage, he rubbed his watch and wished for a still more beautiful house, four stories high, and hung with gold, silver, and damask; filled with wonderful tables, covered with dishes such as no king had ever eaten before. The King, the Queen, and the Princess were speechless with surprise. Never had they seen such a splendid palace, nor such a high feast! At dessert the King asked Jenik"s father to give him the young man for a son-in-law. No sooner said than done! The marriage took place at once, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='house;place;marriage;palace;wife' adjectives='enchanted;own' verbs='leave;return;take' valence='6.202' arousal='4.331' dominance='5.671'>the King</entity> returned to his own palace, and left <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='house;place;marriage;palace;wife' adjectives='enchanted;own' verbs='leave;return;take' valence='6.202' arousal='4.331' dominance='5.671'>Jenik</entity> with his wife in the enchanted house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='372'>Now Jenik was not a very clever man, and at the end of a very short time he began to bore his wife. She inquired how he managed to build palaces and to get so many precious things. He told her all about the watch, and she never rested till she had stolen the precious talisman. One night she took the watch, rubbed it, and wished for a carriage drawn by four horses; and in this carriage she at once set out for her father"s palace. There she called to her own attendants, bade them follow her into the carriage, and drove straight to the sea-side. Then she rubbed her watch, and wished that the sea might be crossed by a bridge, and that a magnificent palace might arise in the middle of the sea. No sooner said than done. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='instant;watch' adjectives='' verbs='rub;be;go;enter' valence='6.178' arousal='4.249' dominance='5.91'>Princess</entity> entered <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='instant;watch' adjectives='' verbs='rub;be;go;enter' valence='6.178' arousal='4.249' dominance='5.91'>the house</entity>, rubbed her watch, and in an instant <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='instant;watch' adjectives='' verbs='rub;be;go;enter' valence='6.178' arousal='4.249' dominance='5.91'>the bridge</entity> was gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='373'>Left alone, Jenik felt very miserable. His father, mother, and brothers, and, indeed, everybody else, all laughed at him. Nothing remained to him but the cat and dog whose lives he had once saved. He took them with him and went far away, for he could no longer live with his family. He reached at last a great desert, and saw some crows flying towards a mountain. One of them was a long way behind, and when he arrived his brothers inquired what had made him so late. "Winter is here," they said, "and it is time to fly to other countries." He told them that he had seen in the middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='middle;house' adjectives='wonderful' verbs='be;see;tell;have;build' valence='6.25444444444' arousal='3.58444444444' dominance='5.84333333333'>the sea</entity> the most wonderful house that ever was built.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='374'>On hearing this, Jenik at once concluded that this must be the hiding-place of his wife. So he proceeded directly to the shore with his dog and his cat. When he arrived on the beach, he said to the dog: "You are an excellent swimmer, and you, little one, are very light; jump on the dog"s back and he will take you to the palace. Once there, he will hide himself near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hold;watch' adjectives='' verbs='try;steal;hide;get' valence='5.16666666667' arousal='3.87888888889' dominance='5.49222222222'>the door</entity>, and you must steal secretly in and try to get hold of my watch."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='375'>No sooner said than done. The two animals crossed the sea; the dog hid near the house, and the cat stole into the chamber. The Princess recognised him, and guessed why he had come; and she took the watch down to the cellar and locked it in a box. But the cat wriggled its way into the cellar, and the moment the Princess turned her back, he scratched and scratched till he had made a hole in the box. Then he took the watch between his teeth, and waited quietly till the Princess came back. Scarcely had she opened <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='watch;bargain;cat' adjectives='outside' verbs='be;open;have' valence='6.23428571429' arousal='3.98857142857' dominance='5.94714285714'>the door</entity> when the cat was outside, and the watch into the bargain.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='390'>Everybody knows that though the fairies live hundreds of years they do sometimes die, and especially as they are obliged to pass one day in every week under the form of some animal, when of course they are liable to accident. It was in this way that death once overtook the Queen of the Fairies, and it became necessary to call a general assembly to elect a new sovereign. After much discussion, it appeared that the choice lay between two fairies, one called Surcantine and the other Paridamie; and their claims were so equal that it was impossible without injustice to prefer one to the other. Under these circumstances it was unanimously decided that whichever of the two could show to the world the greatest wonder should be Queen; but it was to be a special kind of wonder, no moving of mountains or any such common fairy tricks would do. Surcantine, therefore, resolved that she would bring up a Prince whom nothing could make constant. While Paridamie decided to display to admiring mortals a Princess so charming that no one could see her without falling in love with her. They were allowed to take their own time, and meanwhile the four oldest fairies were to attend to the affairs of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='affair;fairy;time' adjectives='oldest;own' verbs='attend;be;take;allow' valence='5.638' arousal='3.927' dominance='5.767'>the kingdom</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='391'>Now Paridamie had for a long time been very friendly with King Bardondon, who was a most accomplished Prince, and whose court was the model of what a court should be. His Queen, Balanice, was also charming; indeed it is rare to find a husband and wife so perfectly of one mind about everything. They had one little daughter, whom they had named "Rosanella," because she had a little pink rose printed upon her white throat. From her earliest infancy she had shown the most astonishing intelligence, and the courtiers knew her smart sayings by heart, and repeated them on all occasions. In the middle of the night following the assembly of fairies, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='assembly;maid;honour;middle;fairy;shriek;dream;matter' adjectives='frightful' verbs='be;run;see;wake;have;follow;find' valence='5.7025' arousal='4.1665' dominance='5.399'>Queen Balanice</entity> woke up with a shriek, and when her maids of honour ran to see what was the matter, they found she had had a frightful dream.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='392'>"I thought," said she, "that my little daughter had changed into a bouquet of roses, and that as I held it in my hand a bird swooped down suddenly and snatched it from me and carried it away."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='394'>So they ran; but what was their dismay when they found that the cradle was empty; and though they sought high and low, not a trace of Rosanella could they discover. The Queen was inconsolable, and so, indeed, was the King, only being a man he did not say quite so much about his feelings. He presently proposed to Balanice that they should spend a few days at one of their palaces in the country; and to this she willingly agreed, since her grief made the gaiety of the capital distasteful to her. One lovely summer evening, as they sat together on a shady lawn shaped like a star, from which radiated twelve splendid avenues of trees, the Queen looked round and saw a charming peasant-girl approaching by each path, and what was still more singular was that everyone carried something in a basket which appeared to occupy her whole attention. As each drew near she laid her basket at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='basket;foot;s' adjectives='' verbs='draw;lay;say' valence='5.60166666667' arousal='3.66333333333' dominance='5.97333333333'>Balanice</entity>"s feet, saying:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='396'>The Queen hastily opened the baskets, and found in each a lovely baby-girl, about the same age as the little Princess for whom she sorrowed so deeply. At first the sight of them renewed her grief; but presently their charms so gained upon her that she forgot her melancholy in providing them with nursery-maids, cradle-rockers, and ladies-in-waiting, and in sending hither and thither for swings and dolls and tops, and bushels of the finest sweetmeats.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='397'>Oddly enough, every baby had upon its throat a tiny pink rose. The Queen found it so difficult to decide on suitable names for all of them, that until she could settle the matter she chose a special colour for everyone, by which it was known, so that when they were all together they looked like nothing so much as a nosegay of gay flowers. As they grew older it became evident that though they were all remarkably intelligent, and profited equally by the education they received, yet they differed one from another in disposition, so much so that they gradually ceased to be known as "Pearl," or "Primrose," or whatever might have been their colour, and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pearl;colour;education;primrose;disposition' adjectives='intelligent;evident;older' verbs='be;differ;profit;receive;say;cease;know;have;become;grow' valence='6.04095238095' arousal='3.84904761905' dominance='5.9080952381'>Queen</entity> instead would say:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>"Where is my Sweet?" or "my Beautiful," or "my Gay."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='399'>Of course, with all these charms they had lovers by the dozen. Not only in their own court, but princes from afar, who were constantly arriving, attracted by the reports which were spread abroad; but these lovely girls, the first Maids of Honour, were as discreet as they were beautiful, and favoured no one.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='400'>But let us return to Surcantine. She had fixed upon the son of a king who was cousin to Bardondon, to bring up as her fickle Prince. She had before, at his christening, given him all the graces of mind and body that a prince could possibly require; but now she redoubled her efforts, and spared no pains in adding every imaginable charm and fascination. So that whether he happened to be cross or amiable, splendidly or simply attired, serious or frivolous, he was always perfectly irresistible! In truth, he was a charming young fellow, since the Fairy had given him the best heart in the world as well as the best head, and had left nothing to be desired but--constancy. For it cannot be denied that Prince Mirliflor was a desperate flirt, and as fickle as the wind; so much so, that by the time he arrived at his eighteenth birthday there was not a heart left for him to conquer in his father"s kingdom--they were all his own, and he was tired of everyone! Things were in this state when he was invited to visit <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thing;state;father;s;cousin' adjectives='' verbs='be;visit;invite' valence='5.76272727273' arousal='3.88545454545' dominance='5.36454545455'>the court</entity> of his father"s cousin, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;state;father;s;cousin' adjectives='' verbs='be;visit;invite' valence='5.76272727273' arousal='3.88545454545' dominance='5.36454545455'>King Bardondon</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='401'>Imagine his feelings when he arrived and was presented at once to twelve of the loveliest creatures in the world, and his embarrassment was heightened by the fact that they all liked him as much as he liked each one of them, so that things came to such a pass that he was never happy a single instant without them. For could he not whisper soft speeches to Sweet, and laugh with Joy, while he looked at Beauty? And in his more serious moments what could be pleasanter than to talk to Grave upon some shady lawn, while he held the hand of Loving in his own, and all the others lingered near in sympathetic silence? For the first time in his life he really loved, though the object of his devotion was not one person, but twelve, to whom he was equally attached, and even Surcantine was deceived into thinking that this was indeed the height of inconstancy. But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='5.56' arousal='4.47666666667' dominance='6.03333333333'>Paridamie</entity> said not a word.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='402'>In vain did Prince Mirliflor"s father write commanding him to return, and proposing for him one good match after another. Nothing in the world could tear him from his twelve enchantresses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='403'>One day the Queen gave a large garden-party, and just as the guests were all assembled, and Prince Mirliflor was as usual dividing his attentions between the twelve beauties, a humming of bees was heard. The Rose-maidens, fearing their stings, uttered little shrieks, and fled all together to a distance from the rest of the company. Immediately, to the horror of all who were looking on, the bees pursued them, and, growing suddenly to an enormous size, pounced each upon a maiden and carried her off into the air, and in an instant they were all lost to view. This amazing occurrence plunged the whole court into the deepest affliction, and Prince Mirliflor, after giving way to the most violent grief at first, fell gradually into a state of such deep dejection that it was feared if nothing could rouse him he would certainly die. Surcantine came in all haste to see what she could do for her darling, but he rejected with scorn all the portraits of lovely princesses which she offered him for his collection. In short, it was evident that he was in a bad way, and the Fairy was at her wits" end. One day, as he wandered about absorbed in melancholy reflections, he heard sudden shouts and exclamations of amazement, and if he had taken the trouble to look up he could not have helped being as astonished as everyone else, for through the air a chariot of crystal was slowly approaching which glittered in the sunshine. Six lovely maidens with shining wings drew it by rose-coloured ribbons, while a whole flight of others, equally beautiful, were holding long garlands of roses crossed above it, so as to form a complete canopy. In it sat the Fairy Paridamie, and by her side a Princess whose beauty positively dazzled all who saw her. At the foot of the great staircase they descended, and proceeded to the Queen"s apartments, though everyone had run together to see this marvel, till it was quite difficult to make a way through the crowd; and exclamations of wonder rose on all sides at the loveliness of the strange Princess. "Great <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='great;cradle;daughter' adjectives='' verbs='restore;say;steal;permit' valence='5.605' arousal='4.545' dominance='5.393'>Queen</entity>," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='great;cradle;daughter' adjectives='' verbs='restore;say;steal;permit' valence='5.605' arousal='4.545' dominance='5.393'>Paridamie</entity>, "permit me to restore to you your daughter <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='great;cradle;daughter' adjectives='' verbs='restore;say;steal;permit' valence='5.605' arousal='4.545' dominance='5.393'>Rosanella</entity>, whom I stole out of her cradle."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='407'>"Very soon you will cease to miss them!" in a tone that evidently meant "Don"t ask me any more questions." And then mounting again into her chariot she swiftly disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='408'>The news of his beautiful cousin"s arrival was soon carried to the Prince, but he had hardly the heart to go and see her. However, it became absolutely necessary that he should pay his respects, and he had scarcely been five minutes in her presence before it seemed to him that she combined in her own charming person all the gifts and graces which had so attracted him in the twelve Rose-maidens whose loss he had so truly mourned; and after all it is really more satisfactory to make love to one person at a time. So it came to pass that before he knew where he was he was entreating his lovely cousin to marry him, and the moment the words had left his lips, Paridamie appeared, smiling and triumphant, in the chariot of the Queen of the Fairies, for by that time they had all heard of her success, and declared her to have earned the kingdom. She had to give a full account of how she had stolen <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='account;inconstancy;character;cradle;charm;part' adjectives='full;united;more' verbs='cure;steal;divide;have;give' valence='5.714' arousal='4.182' dominance='5.384'>Rosanella</entity> from her cradle, and divided her character into twelve parts, that each might charm <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='account;inconstancy;character;cradle;charm;part' adjectives='full;united;more' verbs='cure;steal;divide;have;give' valence='5.714' arousal='4.182' dominance='5.384'>Prince Mirliflor</entity>, and when once more united might cure him of his inconstancy once and for ever.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='415'>Once upon a time there lived in the same village two children, one called Sylvain and the other Jocosa, who were both remarkable for beauty and intelligence. It happened that their parents were not on terms of friendship with one another, on account of some old quarrel, which had, however, taken place so long ago, that they had quite forgotten what it was all about, and only kept up the feud from force of habit. Sylvain and Jocosa for their parts were far from sharing this enmity, and indeed were never happy when apart. Day after day they fed their flocks of sheep together, and spent the long sunshiny hours in playing, or resting upon some shady bank. It happened one day that the Fairy of the Meadows passed by and saw them, and was so much attracted by their pretty faces and gentle manners that she took them under her protection, and the older they grew the dearer they became to her. At first she showed her interest by leaving in their favourite haunts many little gifts such as they delighted to offer one to the other, for they loved each other so much that their first thought was always, "What will Jocosa like?" or, "What will please Sylvain?" And the Fairy took a great delight in their innocent enjoyment of the cakes and sweetmeats she gave them nearly every day. When they were grown up she resolved to make herself known to them, and chose a time when they were sheltering from the noonday sun in the deep shade of a flowery hedgerow. They were startled at first by the sudden apparition of a tall and slender lady, dressed all in green, and crowned with a garland of flowers. But when she spoke to them sweetly, and told them how she had always loved them, and that it was she who had given them all the pretty things which it had so surprised them to find, they thanked her gratefully, and took pleasure in answering the questions she put to them. When she presently bade them farewell, she told them never to tell anyone else that they had seen her. "You will often see me again," added she, "and I shall be with you frequently, even when you do not see me." So saying she vanished, leaving them in a state of great wonder and excitement. After this she came often, and taught them numbers of things, and showed them many of the marvels of her beautiful kingdom, and at last one day she said to them, "You know that I have always been kind to you; now I think it is time you did something for me in your turn. You both remember the fountain I call my favourite? Promise me that every morning before the sun rises you will go to it and clear away every stone that impedes its course, and every dead leaf or broken twig that sullies its clear waters. I shall take it as a proof of your gratitude to me if you neither forget nor delay this duty, and I promise that so long as the sun"s earliest rays find my favourite spring the clearest and sweetest in all my meadows, you two shall not be parted from one another."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='416'>Sylvain and Jocosa willingly undertook this service, and indeed felt that it was but a very small thing in return for all that the fairy had given and promised to them. So for a long time the fountain was tended with the most scrupulous care, and was the clearest and prettiest in all the country round. But one morning in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='direction;flower;beauty;sun;myriad;side' adjectives='other;gay;opposite' verbs='be;pause;rise;gather;tempt;hasten;grow' valence='6.06526315789' arousal='3.71157894737' dominance='5.67473684211'>the spring</entity>, long before the sun rose, they were hastening towards it from opposite directions, when, tempted by the beauty of the myriads of gay flowers which grew thickly on all sides, they paused each to gather some for the other.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='418'>Hither and thither they strayed, led ever farther and farther, for the brightest flowers seemed always just beyond them, until at last they were startled by the first bright rays of the rising sun. With one accord they turned and ran towards the fountain, reaching it at the same moment, though from opposite sides. But what was their horror to see its usually tranquil waters seething and bubbling, and even as they looked down rushed a mighty stream, which entirely engulfed it, and Sylvain and Jocosa found themselves parted by a wide and swiftly-rushing river. All this had happened with such rapidity that they had only time to utter a cry, and each to hold up to the other the flowers they had gathered; but this was explanation enough. Twenty times did Sylvain throw himself into the turbulent waters, hoping to be able to swim to the other side, but each time an irresistible force drove him back upon the bank he had just quitted, while, as for Jocosa, she even essayed to cross the flood upon a tree which came floating down torn up by the roots, but her efforts were equally useless. Then with heavy hearts they set out to follow the course of the stream, which had now grown so wide that it was only with difficulty they could distinguish each other. Night and day, over mountains and through valleys, in cold or in heat, they struggled on, enduring fatigue and hunger and every hardship, and consoled only by the hope of meeting once more--until three years had passed, and at last they stood upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mountain;hardship;hunger;heat;fatigue;sea;valley;meeting;hope' adjectives='mighty;cold;last' verbs='console;flow;endure;stand;have;pass;struggle' valence='5.45833333333' arousal='4.015' dominance='5.26083333333'>the cliffs</entity> where <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mountain;hardship;hunger;heat;fatigue;sea;valley;meeting;hope' adjectives='mighty;cold;last' verbs='console;flow;endure;stand;have;pass;struggle' valence='5.45833333333' arousal='4.015' dominance='5.26083333333'>the river</entity> flowed into the mighty sea.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='419'>And now they seemed farther apart than ever, and in despair they tried once more to throw themselves into the foaming waves. But the Fairy of the Meadows, who had really never ceased to watch over them, did not intend that they should be drowned at last, so she hastily waved her wand, and immediately they found themselves standing side by side upon the golden sand. You may imagine their joy and delight when they realised that their weary struggle was ended, and their utter contentment as they clasped each other by the hand. They had so much to say that they hardly knew where to begin, but they agreed in blaming themselves bitterly for the negligence which had caused all their trouble; and when she heard this the Fairy immediately appeared to them. They threw themselves at her feet and implored her forgiveness, which she granted freely, and promised at the same time that now their punishment was ended she would always befriend them. Then she sent for her chariot of green rushes, ornamented with May dewdrops, which she particularly valued and always collected with great care; and ordered her six short-tailed moles to carry them all back to the well-known pastures, which they did in a remarkably short time; and Sylvain and Jocosa were overjoyed to see their dearly-loved home once more after all their toilful wanderings. The Fairy, who had set her mind upon securing their happiness, had in their absence quite made up the quarrel between their parents, and gained their consent to the marriage of the faithful lovers; and now she conducted them to the most charming little cottage that can be imagined, close to the fountain, which had once more resumed its peaceful aspect, and flowed gently down into the little brook which enclosed the garden and orchard and pasture which belonged to the cottage. Indeed, nothing more could have been thought of, either for Sylvain and Jocosa or for their flocks; and their delight satisfied even the Fairy who had planned it all to please them. When they had explored and admired until they were tired they sat down to rest under the rose-covered porch, and the Fairy said that to pass the time until the wedding guests whom she had invited could arrive she would tell them a story. This is it:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='422'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='423'>Once upon a time a Fairy, who had somehow or other got into mischief, was condemned by the High Court of Fairyland to live for several years under the form of some creature, and at the moment of resuming her natural appearance once again to make the fortune of two men. It was left to her to choose what form she would take, and because she loved yellow she transformed herself into a lovely bird with shining golden feathers such as no one had ever seen before. When the time of her punishment was at an end the beautiful yellow bird flew to Bagdad, and let herself be caught by a Fowler at the precise moment when Badi-al-Zaman was walking up and down outside his magnificent summer palace. This Badi-al-Zaman--whose name means "Wonder-of-the-World"--was looked upon in Bagdad as the most fortunate creature under the sun, because of his vast wealth. But really, what with anxiety about his riches and being weary of everything, and always desiring something he had not, he never knew a moment"s real happiness. Even now he had come out of his palace, which was large and splendid enough for fifty kings, weary and cross because he could find nothing new to amuse him. The Fowler thought that this would be a favourable opportunity for offering him the marvellous bird, which he felt certain he would buy the instant he saw it. And he was not mistaken, for when Badi-al-Zaman took the lovely prisoner into his own hands, he saw written under its right wing the words, "He who eats my head will become a king," and under its left wing, "He who eats my heart will find a hundred gold pieces under his pillow every morning." In spite of all his wealth he at once began to desire the promised gold, and the bargain was soon completed. Then the difficulty arose as to how the bird was to be cooked; for among all his army of servants not one could Badi-al-Zaman trust. At last he asked the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;wife;bird;hearing' adjectives='last' verbs='be;bid;marry;cook;take;ask;tell' valence='6.24545454545' arousal='4.03545454545' dominance='5.70909090909'>Fowler</entity> if he were married, and on hearing that he was he bade him take the bird home with him and tell his wife to cook it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>"Perhaps," said he, "this will give me an appetite, which I have not had for many a long day, and if so your wife shall have a hundred pieces of silver."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='425'>The Fowler with great joy ran home to his wife, who speedily made a savoury stew of the Yellow Bird. But when Badi-al-Zaman reached the cottage and began eagerly to search in the dish for its head and its heart he could not find either of them, and turned to the Fowler"s wife in a furious rage. She was so terrified that she fell upon her knees before him and confessed that her two children had come in just before he arrived, and had so teased her for some of the dish she was preparing that she had presently given the head to one and the heart to the other, since these morsels are not generally much esteemed; and Badi-al-Zaman rushed from the cottage vowing vengeance against the whole family. The wrath of a rich man is generally to be feared, so the Fowler and his wife resolved to send their children out of harm"s way; but the wife, to console her husband, confided to him that she had purposely given them the head and heart of the bird because she had been able to read what was written under its wings. So, believing that their children"s fortunes were made, they embraced them and sent them forth, bidding them get as far away as possible, to take different roads, and to send news of their welfare. For themselves, they remained hidden and disguised in the town, which was really rather clever of them; but very soon afterwards Badi-al-Zaman died of vexation and annoyance at the loss of the promised treasure, and then they went back to their cottage to wait for news of their children. The younger, who had eaten the heart of the Yellow Bird, very soon found out what it had done for him, for each morning when he awoke he found a purse containing a hundred gold pieces under his pillow. But, as all poor people may remember for their consolation, nothing in the world causes so much trouble or requires so much care as a great treasure. Consequently, the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='profusion;gold;son;s;hoard;robber' adjectives='great;long;reckless' verbs='be;die;defend;wound;try;attack;suppose;spend;possess' valence='5.047' arousal='4.695' dominance='5.1305'>Fowler</entity>"s son, who spent with reckless profusion and was supposed to be possessed of a great hoard of gold, was before very long attacked by robbers, and in trying to defend himself was so badly wounded that he died.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='426'>The elder brother, who had eaten the Yellow Bird"s head, travelled a long way without meeting with any particular adventure, until at last he reached a large city in Asia, which was all in an uproar over the choosing of a new Emir. All the principal citizens had formed themselves into two parties, and it was not until after a prolonged squabble that they agreed that the person to whom the most singular thing happened should be Emir. Our young traveller entered the town at this juncture, with his agreeable face and jaunty air, and all at once felt something alight upon his head, which proved to be a snow-white pigeon.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='435'>It generally happens that people"s surroundings reflect more or less accurately their minds and dispositions, so perhaps that is why the Flower Fairy lived in a lovely palace, with the most delightful garden you can imagine, full of flowers, and trees, and fountains, and fish-ponds, and everything nice. For the Fairy herself was so kind and charming that everybody loved her, and all the young princes and princesses who formed her court, were as happy as the day was long, simply because they were near her. They came to her when they were quite tiny, and never left her until they were grown up and had to go away into the great world; and when that time came she gave to each whatever gift he asked of her. But it is chiefly of the Princess Sylvia that you are going to hear now. The Fairy loved her with all her heart, for she was at once original and gentle, and she had nearly reached the age at which the gifts were generally bestowed. However, the Fairy had a great wish to know how the other princesses who had grown up and left her, were prospering, and before the time came for Sylvia to go herself, she resolved to send her to some of them. So one day her chariot, drawn by butterflies, was made ready, and the Fairy said: "Sylvia, I am going to send you to the court of Iris; she will receive you with pleasure for my sake as well as for your own. In two months you may come back to me again, and I shall expect you to tell me what you think of her."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='438'>"You sent me, madam," answered Sylvia, "to the Court of Iris, on whom you had bestowed the gift of beauty. She never tells anyone, however, that it was your gift, though she often speaks of your kindness in general. It seemed to me that her loveliness, which fairly dazzled me at first, had absolutely deprived her of the use of any of her other gifts or graces. In allowing herself to be seen, she appeared to think that she was doing all that could possibly be required of her. But, unfortunately, while I was still with her she became seriously ill, and though she presently recovered, her beauty is entirely gone, so that she hates the very sight of herself, and is in despair. She entreated me to tell you what had happened, and to beg you, in pity, to give her beauty back to her. And, indeed, she does need it terribly, for all the things in her that were tolerable, and even agreeable, when she was so pretty, seem quite different now she is ugly, and it is so long since she thought of using her mind or her natural cleverness, that I really don"t think she has any left now. She is quite aware of all this herself, so you may imagine how unhappy she is, and how earnestly she begs for your aid."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='439'>"You have told me what I wanted to know," cried the Fairy, "but alas! I cannot help her; my gifts can be given but once."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='440'>Some time passed in all the usual delights of the Flower-Fairy"s palace, and then she sent for Sylvia again, and told her she was to stay for a little while with the Princess Daphne, and accordingly the butterflies whisked her off, and set her down in quite a strange kingdom.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='443'>"And very ill the gift of eloquence becomes a woman," replied Sylvia, with an air of conviction. "It is true that she speaks well, and her expressions are well chosen; but then she never leaves off talking, and though at first one may be amused, one ends by being wearied to death. Above all things she loves any assembly for settling the affairs of her kingdom, for on those occasions she can talk and talk without fear of interruption; but, even then, the moment it is over she is ready to begin again about anything or nothing, as the case may be. Oh! how glad I was to come away I cannot tell you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='444'>The Fairy smiled at Sylvia"s unfeigned disgust at her late experience; but after allowing her a little time to recover she sent her to the Court of the Princess Cynthia, where she left her for three months.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='462'>Once upon a time there lived a King and Queen who, though it is a very long while since they died, were much the same in their tastes and pursuits as people nowadays. The King, who was called Cloverleaf, liked hunting better than anything else; but he nevertheless bestowed as much care upon his kingdom as he felt equal to--that is to say, he never made an end of folding and unfolding the State documents. As to the Queen, she had once been very pretty, and she liked to believe that she was so still, which is, of course, always made quite easy for queens. Her name was Frivola, and her one occupation in life was the pursuit of amusement. Balls, masquerades, and picnics followed one another in rapid succession, as fast as she could arrange them, and you may imagine that under these circumstances the kingdom was somewhat neglected. As a matter of fact, if anyone had a fancy for a town, or a province, he helped himself to it; but as long as the King had his horses and dogs, and the Queen her musicians and her actors, they did not trouble themselves about the matter. King Cloverleaf and Queen Frivola had but one child, and this Princess had from her very babyhood been so beautiful, that by the time she was four years old the Queen was desperately jealous of her, and so fearful that when she was grown up she would be more admired than herself, that she resolved to keep her hidden away out of sight. To this end she caused a little house to be built not far beyond the Palace gardens, on the bank of a river. This was surrounded by a high wall, and in it the charming Potentilla was imprisoned. Her nurse, who was dumb, took care of her, and the necessaries of life were conveyed to her through a little window in the wall, while guards were always pacing to and fro outside, with orders to cut off the head of anyone who tried to approach, which they would certainly have done without thinking twice about it. The Queen told everyone, with much pretended sorrow, that the Princess was so ugly, and so troublesome, and altogether so impossible to love, that to keep her out of sight was the only thing that could be done for her. And this tale she repeated so often, that at last the whole court believed it. Things were in this state, and the Princess was about fifteen years old, when Prince Narcissus, attracted by the report of Queen Frivola"s gay doings, presented himself at the court. He was not much older than the Princess, and was as handsome a Prince as you would see in a day"s journey, and really, for his age, not so very scatter-brained. His parents were a King and Queen, whose story you will perhaps read some day. They died almost at the same time, leaving their kingdom to the eldest of their children, and commending their youngest son, Prince Narcissus, to the care of the Fairy Melinette. In this they did very well for him, for the Fairy was as kind as she was powerful, and she spared no pains in teaching the little Prince everything it was good for him to know, and even imparted to him some of her own Fairy lore. But as soon as he was grown up she sent him out to see the world for himself, though all the time she was secretly keeping watch over him, ready to help in any time of need. Before he started she gave him a ring which would render him invisible when he put it on his finger. These rings seem to be quite common; you must often have heard of them, even if you have never seen one. It was in the course of the Prince"s wanderings, in search of experience of men and things, that he came to the court of Queen Frivola, where he was extremely well received.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>Prince Narcissus enjoyed all that went on, and found the time pass very pleasantly. Before long, of course, he heard the story about the Princess Potentilla, and, as it had by that time been repeated many times, and had been added to here and there, she was represented as such a monster of ugliness that he was really quite curious to see her, and resolved to avail himself of the magic power of his ring to accomplish his design. So he made himself invisible, and passed the guard without their so much as suspecting that anyone was near. Climbing the wall was rather a difficulty, but when he at length found himself inside it he was charmed with the peaceful beauty of the little domain it enclosed, and still more delighted when he perceived a slender, lovely maiden wandering among the flowers. It was not until he had sought vainly for the imaginary monster that he realised that this was the Princess herself, and by that time he was deeply in love with her, for indeed it would have been hard to find anyone prettier than Potentilla, as she sat by the brook, weaving a garland of blue forget-me-nots to crown her waving golden locks, or to imagine anything more gentle than the way she tended all the birds and beasts who inhabited her small kingdom, and who all loved and followed her. Prince Narcissus watched her every movement, and hovered near her in a dream of delight, not daring as yet to appear to her, so humble had he suddenly become in her presence. And when evening came, and the nurse fetched the Princess into her little house, he felt obliged to go back to Frivola"s palace, for fear his absence should be noticed and someone should discover his new treasure. But he forgot that to go back absent, and dreamy, and indifferent, when he had before been gay and ardent about everything, was the surest way of awakening suspicion; and when, in response to the jesting questions which were put to him upon the subject, he only blushed and returned evasive answers, all the ladies were certain that he had lost his heart, and did their utmost to discover who was the happy possessor of it. As to the Prince, he was becoming day by day more attached to Potentilla, and his one thought was to attend her, always invisible, and help her in everything she did, and provide her with everything that could possibly amuse or please her. And the Princess, who had learnt to find diversion in very small things in her quiet life, was in a continual state of delight over the treasures which the Prince constantly laid where she must find them. Then Narcissus implored his faithful friend Melinette to send the Princess such dreams of him as should make her recognise him as a friend when he actually appeared before her eyes; and this device was so successful that the Princess quite dreaded the cessation of these amusing dreams, in which a certain Prince Narcissus was such a delightful lover and companion. After that he went a step further and began to have long talks with the Princess--still, however, keeping himself invisible, until she begged him so earnestly to appear to her that he could no longer resist, and after making her promise that, no matter what he was like, she would still love him, he drew the ring from his finger, and the Princess saw with delight that he was as handsome as he was agreeable. Now, indeed, they were perfectly happy, and they passed the whole long summer day in Potentilla"s favourite place by the brook, and when at last Prince Narcissus had to leave her it seemed to them both that the hours had gone by with the most amazing swiftness. The Princess stayed where she was, dreaming of her delightful Prince, and nothing could have been further from her thoughts than any trouble or misfortune, when suddenly, in a cloud of dust and shavings, by came the enchanter Grumedan, and unluckily he chanced to catch sight of Potentilla. Down he came straightway and alighted at her feet, and one look at her charming blue eyes and smiling lips quite decided him that he must appear to her at once, though he was rather annoyed to remember that he had on only his second-best cloak. The Princess sprang to her feet with a cry of terror at this sudden apparition, for really the Enchanter was no beauty. To begin with, he was very big and clumsy, then he had but one eye, and his teeth were long, and he stammered badly; nevertheless, he had an excellent opinion of himself, and mistook the Princess"s cry of terror for an exclamation of delighted surprise. After pausing a moment to give her time to admire him, the Enchanter made her the most complimentary speech he could invent, which, however, did not please her at all, though he was extremely delighted with it himself. Poor Potentilla only shuddered and cried:</paragraph>

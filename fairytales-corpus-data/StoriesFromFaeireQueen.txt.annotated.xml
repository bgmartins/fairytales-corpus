	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>A hideous dragon came from another country, and killed men and women and little children. With its fiery breath it turned the trees and grass and flowers into black ashes, and it slew everybody that it came across.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='78'>It would have killed Una"s father and mother too, but they and some of their servants shut themselves up in a tower made of brass. The dragon tried very hard to get in and eat them up, but it could not break into a tower so strong.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>Before they had gone very far a storm came on. The sky grew dark and rain fell heavily, and they would have been drenched had they not found shelter in a thick wood. There were wide paths in this wood, and tall trees whose leafy branches grew so close that no rain could come through.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>It was such a beautiful wood, and they were so happy talking together and listening to the birds" sweet song, that they rode along without noticing where they went.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>So when the rain stopped and they wished to get back to the open road, they could not find the way. On and on they went, until they came to the mouth of a great dark cave.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>The frightened dwarf also begged him to come away, but the knight said, "I should be ashamed to come back. If one is good, one need have no fear of the darkness."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>So into the darkness he went, and in the faint light that came from his shining armour he saw a hideous monster. It had a great ugly head and a long speckled tail like a serpent"s, and it rushed at the knight, roaring furiously. He struck at it with his sword, but it wound its horrible tail around him, until he was nearly crushed to death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>Una called to him not to fear, but to strike the monster bravely. And he, smiting it with all his might, cut off its head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>Then Una and he rode joyfully onwards, and, as evening fell, they found a way out of the wood. On the road they met an old man who looked kind and good. He asked them to stay all night in his cottage in a little valley near at hand, and they gladly went.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>This old man was a wicked magician, and all he wanted was to do them harm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='98'>When they had lain down to rest, he began to work his magic on them. So well did he do it, that he made the Red Cross Knight believe that Una was very false and wicked, and that the best thing he could do was to go away from her.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>Day after day, up hill and down dale, in woods and on lonely moors, she sought her knight. And her heart was very sad, because he whom she loved had left her so ungently.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='102'>One day when she was very tired she lay down to rest under the trees in a thick wood. She took off her black cloak, and her beautiful golden hair fell loosely round her face. Her face was so fair and so full of goodness that it seemed to make sunshine in the shady place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>Suddenly there rushed at her from out of the wood a furious lion. He was hunting for something to kill and eat, and when he saw Una he ran at her greedily, with hungry gaping jaws.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='104'>But when it had looked at her lovely face, instead of tearing her in pieces it gently licked her little white hands and feet. And Una"s sad heart was so grateful to the noble beast that her tears dropped on him as he did it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>The lion would not leave her. He kept watch while she slept, and when she was awake he followed her like a faithful dog.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='110'>The two women were hiding in a dark corner, half-dead from fear. Una tried to comfort them, and asked them if she and her lion might shelter there for the night. When darkness came she lay down, very tired, to sleep, while her lion lay and watched at her feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='111'>In the middle of the night a knock came to the door. It was a wicked robber, who used to bring the things he stole and give them to those two bad women.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>As they were going home they met the wicked magician. They told him about Una, and he rode quickly after her. By his magic he made himself armour the same as that of the Red Cross Knight, and when Una saw him she thought it was her own true knight come back to her at last. He spoke to her as if he was really her knight, and her heart was filled with gladness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='115'>But she was not the only one who thought that the wicked magician was the Red Cross Knight. Sansloy, a rough and wicked man, whose brother had been killed in a fight with the Knight of the Red Cross, came riding along and met them.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='116'>The old magician had to fight, whether he wanted to or not, and Sansloy fought so fiercely that he wounded him and cast him bleeding on the ground.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='117'>Sansloy was afraid of the magician, so he drew back and did not hurt him more. But when he saw how beautiful Una was, he roughly dragged her off her ass, and made up his mind to take her away with him and make her his wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='118'>When the lion saw the knight roughly take hold of Una, he made a fierce rush at him, and would have torn him in pieces; but Sansloy beat the lion back with his shield, and when the lion would have torn the shield from him, he drove his sword deep into the lion"s faithful heart. With a great roar the noble beast fell dead, and Sansloy threw Una before him on his horse and galloped away with her. She wept and sobbed and begged him to let her go, but Sansloy would not listen. And it seemed as if Una had no friend left, or, at least, no friend that could help her. For the little white donkey trotted after her, afraid of nothing except to be left alone without his mistress.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='86'>THREE names in the living literature of Norway may be  said to have escaped from the provinciality of a narrow home-  circle, and to have conquered a place for themselves in the  general European ooncert. Two of these,  Ibsen and Bjornson,   are borne by professional poets ; the third is that of a man  of science whose irresistible bias towards literary style may be  said to have made a poet of him against his will. The  novelettes of Bjornson and the comedies of Ibsen belong to  the tradition of imaginative art, but the stories of Asbjornsen  a selection from which is here introduced to the English public,  in some sense inaugurated a new order in literature.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>or made a walking tour up into the mountains, the fondest  object of the journey was to coax a story out of every peasant  whom they met. Asbjornsen soon surpassed Moe in the width  of his experience ; his profession was one which took him  habitually from one end of the kingdom to the other, whereas  his friend, with a genius perhaps more naturally attuned than  his to the music of mountain and cascade, settled down as a  country parson into a narrower and more humdrum circle.  Yet it is Moe, and specially in that delightful study of his  entitled Blind Anne, who has given us the most complete and  vivid sketch of the mode in which the friends collected the  materials for their books. In 1838 Asbjornsen first made public  the results of his investigations, very shyly and timorously, in  a little publication for children, called Nor. Not until 1842  did the first authorised edition of Norwegian Folk and Fairy  Tales, collected by Peter Christen Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe,  see the light at Christiania ; it gradually became widely suc-  cessful, and was followed in 1871 by a new selection, from the  pen of Asbjornsen alone. In the mean time, as early as 1845,  Asbjornsen had published his well-known volume of Huldre-  eventyr, or stories about the nymphs or sirens which haunt  the high, sparse woods and mountain dairies. Of these also a  second selection was printed in 1848. The present gathering of  tales, therefore, is a nosegay plucked from these four gardens  of the imagination, wild plots full of strange Alpine blossoms,  and perfumed with the wind from the pine-forest.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='104'>Until the generation now lately passed away, almost the  only mode in which the Norwegian peasant killed time in the  leisure moments between his daily labour and his religious  observances, was in listening to stories. It was the business  of old men and women who had reached the extreme limit of  their working powers, to retain and repeat these ancient legends  in prose and verse, and to recite or sing them when called upon  to do so. Such minstrels were held in great respect, and were  found in every parish. Moe has observed that there was a  certain distinction in the themes selected by the two sexes ;  from the old women there was required a grim or melancholy  class of story, while the old men were called upon for more  humorous tales and staves. Asbjornsen and Moe were only  just in time to preserve the stories from extinction ; in many  districts they had already ceased to exist, in others they  remained solely in the memories of a few very aged persons.  One or two valleys in Thelemarken, the Assynt of Norway,  that district at the back of Kongsberg where the scanty popu-  lation still shrinks from the transforming touch of modern life,  supplied the richest treasure in folk-lore ; wherever the explorers  could hear of belt-fights within the memory of man, there they  were sure of* being on the edge of the more ancient civilization,  and safe to find the rare product they were seeking. On the  other hand, in modernised and Europeanised provinces like  Hardanger, where much intercourse by sea with strangers had  destroyed the antique isolation, the stories were less abundant,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='110'>less genuine, and less characteristic. It was from minstrels at  bridal- feasts, from boatmen on the fjords, from old blind vaga-  bonds and the household paupers who form so strange a  feature of a Norse peasant community, that they obtained  most of their best stories ; and it is a significant fact that  almost all these professional reciters are now dead.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>The stories must now be left to speak for themselves. Of  the wonderful links that comparative mythology has found in  them, chains that bind Norway in one brotherhood with Ireland  and Germany, with Wallachia and Hindustan, nothing needs  be said in a popular selection like the present. The stories |  are charming as tales of primitive Norse life, and if mythologists  can find by dissecting them an undergrowth of ancient history,  that is an additional pleasure for them. It is difficult to doubt  that though Asbjornsen is himself a learned saw in this species  of science, it is mainly the tale that has delighted him, the  quaint wit, the savage pathos, the intimate and tender sympathy  with all that is wild and solitary in the nature of his fatherland.  And as a literary artist this is his highest praise, that he has  contrived to lay the peculiarities of Norwegian landscape  before his readers with a subtlety of touch such as no other  poet or proseman has achieved  not by description so much as  by a series of those sympathetic and brilliant touches whic 1 *</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='125'>u" -IE wind was whistling through the old lime and  maple trees opposite my windows, the snow was  sweeping down the street, and the sky was black as a December  sky can possibly be here in Christiania. I was in just as black  a mood. It was Christmas Eve, the first I was to spend away  from the cosy fireside of my home. I had lately received my  officer"s commission, and had hoped that I should have gladdened  my aged parents with my presence during the holidays, and  had also hoped that I should be able to show myself in all my  glory and splendour to tin ladies of our parish. But a fever had  brought me to the hospital, which I had left only a week before,  and now I found mysc! f in the much-extolled state of convalescence,  I had written home for a horse and sledge and my father"s fur  coat, but my letter could scarcely reach our valley before the  day after Christmas, and the horse could not be in town before  New Year"s Eve.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='129'>My comrades had all left town, and I knew no family with  whom I could make myself at home during the holidays. The two  old maids I lodged with were certainly very kind and friendly  people, and they had taken great care of me in the commencement  of my illness, but the peculiar ways and habits of these ladies were  too much of the old school to prove attractive to the fancies of  youth. Their thoughts dwelt mostly on the past, and when they,  as often might occur, related to me some stories of the town, its  people and its customs, these stories reminded me, not only by their  contents, but also by the simple unaffected way in which they were  rendered, of a past age.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>The antiquated appearance of these ladies was also in the strictest  harmony with the house in which they lived. It was one of those  old houses in Custom-house Street, with deep windows, long dark  passages and staircases, gloomy rooms and garrets, where one could  not help thinking of ghosts and brownies ; in short, just such a house,  and perhaps it was the very one, which Mauritz Hansen has de-  scribed in his story, The Old Dame with the Hood. Their circle  of acquaintances was very limited; besides a married sister and  Iut children, no other visitors came there but a couple of tiresome  old ladies. The only relief to this kind of life was a pretty niece  and some merry little cousins of hers, who always made me tell  thrni fairy tales and stories.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='131'>I tried to divert myself in my loneliness and melancholy mood  by looking out at all the people who passed up and down the street  in the snow and wind with blue noses and half-shut eyes. It  amused me to see the bustle and the life in the apothecary\"s shop  across the street. The door was scarcely shut for a moment.  Servants and peasants streamed in and out, and commenced to  .study the labels and directions when they came out in the street.  Some appeared to be able to make them out, but sometimes a  lengthy study and a dubious shake of the head showed that the  .solution was too difficult. It was growing dusk. I could not  distinguish the countenances any longer, but gazed across at the  old building. The apothecary\"s house, " The Swan/\" as it is still  called, stood there with its dark, reddish-brown walls, its pointed</paragraph>

The Swan looked then as now a most resectable and  sedate bird, with its gold ring around the neck, its spur-boots  and its wings stretched out as if ready to fly. I was about to  plunge myself into reflection on imprisoned birds, when I was</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='142'>I accepted the friendly invitation. As I entered the room, the  fire from the large square stove, where the logs were burning lustily,  threw a red, flickering light through the wide-open door over the  room, which was very deep, and furnished in the old style with  high-backed Russia leather chairs, and one of those settees which  were intended for farthingales and straight up-and-down positions.

She  had one day to get up very early in the morning to brew, when  the other servants said to her : \" You had better mind you don\"t  get up too early, and you mustn\"t put any fire under the copper  before two o\"clock.\" \" Why ? \" she asked. \" Don\"t you know there  is a brownie here ; and you ought to know that these people don\"t  like to be disturbed so early/ they said, \"and before two o\"clock  you mustn\"t light the fire by any means/ \"Is that all ?\" said Kari ;  she was anything but chicken-hearted. \" I have nothing to do with  that brownie of yours, but if he comes in my way, why, by my  faith, I will send him head over heeis through the door.\" The  others warned her, but she did not care a bit, and next morning,  just as the clock struck one, she got up and lighted the fire  under the copper in the brew-house. But the fire went out every  moment. Somebody appeared to be throwing the logs about  on the hearth, but sri ; could not see who it was. She gathered  the logs together one time after the other, but it was of no  use and the chimney would not draw either. She got tired of  this at last, took a burning log and ran round the room with it,  swinging it high and low while she shouted: \"Be gone, be gone  whence you came!

I have neither seen  one nor the other,  of course I have not been so very much about  in my lifetime, but I believe it is all nonsense. But old Stine out  in the kitchen there, she says she has seen the brownie. About  the time when I was confirmed, she was in service with my parents.  She came to us from a captain\"s, who had given up the sea. It was  a very quiet place. They never went anywhere, and nobody came  to see them. The captain only took a walk as far as the quay  every day. They always went to bed early. People said there  was a brownie in the house. Well, it so happened that Stine and  the cook were sitting in their room one evening, mending and  darning their things ; it was near bedtime, for the watchman had  already sung out " Ten o\"clock," but somehow the darning and  the sewing went on very slowly indeed ; every moment "Jack Nap"  came and played his tricks upon them ! At one moment Stine was  nodding and nodding, and then came the cook\"s turn  they could  not keep their eyes open ; they had been early up that morning to  wash clothes. But just as they were sitting thus, they heard a  terrible crash down stairs in the kitchen and Stine shouted : \" Lor*  bless and preserve us ! it must be the brownie.\" She was so  frightened she dared scarcely move a foot, but at last the cook  plucked up courage and went down into the kitchen, closely  followed by Stine. When they opened the kitchen door, they  found all the crockery on the floor, but none of it broken, while the  brownie was standing on the big kitchen table with his red cap on  and hurling the one dish after the other on to the floor and laughing  in great glee. The cook had heard that the brownies could some-  times be tricked into moving to another house, when anybody  would tell them of a very quiet place, and as she long had been  wishing for an opportunity to play a trick upon this brownie, she  took courage and spoke to him  her voice was a little shaky at  the time that he ought to remove to the tinman\"s over the way,  where it was so very quiet and pleasant, because they always went</paragraph>

Since that day  they never saw the brownie any more at the captain\"s. Ke seemed  to feel quite at home at the tinman\"s, although they were hammering  and tapping away there all day, but people said that the gudewife put  a dish of porridge up in the garret for him every Thursday evening;  and it\"s no wonder that they got on well and became rich when  they had a brownie in the house.

Suddenly  the lights were brought in, and we discovered then to our great  amusement that the children had put their legs on to the table. The  lights, the Christmas cake, the jellies, the tarts, and the wine soon  chased away the horrible ghost story and all fear from their minds,  revived everybody\"s spirits, and brought the conversation on to  their neighbours and the topics of the day.

I do not know whether  it was the stories, the substantial supper, my weak condition,  or all these combined, which was the cause of it ; I tossed myself  hither and thither in my bed and got mixed up with brownies,  fairies, and ghosts the whole night. Finally I sailed through the  air towards the church, while some merry sledge bells were  ringing in my ears. The church was lighted up, and when I came  inside I saw it was our own church up in the valley.

These fairy-lands are only seen:  by very pious people or by those who are gifted with second  sight, when in danger of their lives at sea, and they appear where  at other times no land is to be found. The supernatural people  who live here have farms and keep cattle, fish and own ships, like  other folks, but here the sun shines on greener pastures and richer  corn fields than .elsewhere in the north ; and fortunate, indeed, is he  who has landed on or even has seen one of these sunny isles ;  " he  is a made man," say the people in the north. An old ballad, in  the style of Peder Dass, gives a full description of an island  off Traenen in Helgoland, called Sandflaesen, with rich fisheries  and abounding with game of all sorts. In the middle of the  Vestford a large flat land with rich corn fields also appears,  but it only rises high enough above the surface of the water  to leave the ears of the corn dry ; and outside Rost, off the  southern point of the Lofoten islands, a similar fairy land with  green hills and golden barley fields is spoken of, which is called  Udrost. The farmer on Udrost owns his fishing-smack just like  any other farmer in the north ; sometimes the fishermen see it  under full sails, and steering right down upon them, but just as.  they expect to be run down, it disappears.</paragraph>

He sat half asleep with the tiller in  his hand, when all at once the boat grated against the beach and  ran aground. Isaac was not long in getting his eyes open. The  sun was breaking through the fog and shone upon a splendid  country ; the hills and the cliffs were green right to the top, with  meadows and cornfields on the slopes, and he thought he felt a  scent of flowers and grass which he never had felt before.</paragraph>

On the roof of the hut was a white  goat with gilt horns, grazing ; its udder was as large as the largest  cow\"s. Outside the hut sat a little old man on a wooden stool,  smoking a cutty-pipe.

Isaac ate and drank as much as he  was able, but still his plate never became empty, and. although he  drank a good deal, his glass was always full. The old man did  not eat much, and he did not speaK much either ; but just as they  were sitting, they heard a scream and a great noise outside.  The old man went out, and soon came back with his three sons.

They said he must follow their custom  and sit down and drink wkh them, for Isaac was going to leave  the table ; he had been doing very well, he said.

" I am so hungry, I hear the wind whistling in my  empty stomach. I have had nothing to eat for two years."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='459'>When they had gone to bed in the evening, the princess asked  again where his heart was, because she was so very fond of him,  she said, that she would so like to know it.

Ah, ha, thought both  Ashiepattle and the princess, we will soon try to find it Next  morning the giant was early out of bed, and made for the wood  again, but the moment he was gone Ashicpattle r.nd the princess  were looking in the cupboard for the heart, but they looked and  searched and found no heart. " Well, we must try once more,"  said the princess. She hung flowers and garlands around the  cupboard, and when the evening came Ashiepattle crept under the  bed again. Shortly the giant came in. " Ugh, Ugh ! " he roared,  "what a smell of Christian blood there is here."  "Yes, a magpie  flew past here just now, and dropped a man\"s bone down the  chimney," said the princess ; " I made haste to throw it out, but I  suppose that\"s what you still smell." When the giant heard this,  be said no more about it; but as soon as he saw the cupboard  decked out with flowers and garlands, he asked who it was that  had done that. It was the princess, of course. "But what\"s the  caning of all this foolery ? " asked the giant.  " Well, you know</paragraph>

"  " Ah, well," said the prin-  cess, " but I should like to know  for all that where it is."  So the  giant could not refuse to tell her  any longer, and he said : " Far, far  away in a lake !ies an island,   on that island stands a church,   in. that church there is a well,   in that well swims a duck,  in that  duck there is an egg,  and in the  e gg  well, there is my heart."</paragraph>

He said  farewell to the princess for a time,  and when he came outside the  castle there was the wolf still wait-  ing for him. He told the wolf  what had happened inside, and  that he was now going to set out  for the well in the church, if he  only knew the way. The wolf  asked him to jump on his back,   he would try and find the way,</paragraph>

The prince d:d not know how he should get across it ; but the wolf  asked him only not to be afraid, and then he plunged into the  water with the prince on his bick and swam across to the island.  When they came to the church, they found the key for the  church-door banging high, high up on the steeple, and at first the  young prince did not know how to get hold of it " You will have  to call the raven, 1 " sa : d the wol which the prince did. The raven  came at once, and flew up for the key, and so the prince got inside  the church. When he came to the well, the duck was there sure  enough. It was swimming about just as the giant had said. He  commenced calling and calling, and at last he lured her up to him  and caught her. But just as he was lifting her out of the water,  the duck let the egg fall in the well ; and Ashiepattle didn\"t know  how to get it up again. " You had better call the salmon," said  the wolf, which the prince did. The salmon came and fetched the  egg from the bottom of the well. The wolf then told him to  squeeze the egg, and as soon as Ashiepattle squeezed it, they  heard the giant screaming. " Squeeze it once more," said the wolf,  and when the prince did so, the giant screamed still more pitcously,  and prayed so nicely and gently for himself; he would do all the  prince wished, *if he only wouldn\"t squeeze his heart to pieces.   * Tell him, that if he will give you back again alive your six  brothers and their brides, which he turned into stone, you will  srare his life," said the wolf, and Ashiepattle did so.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='551'>Early in May  this was long before the game laws had been  hatched  we started on our way to Skjcersjohaug, according to  local tradition the place where we were most likely to see the  capercailzies and their play. 1 There were four of us,  my friend  the captain, myself, an old sportsman from Sognedale, called Peter  Sandaker, and a smart boy, who had charge of two brace of  hounds. We were to try for a hare, as soon as our sport with the  capercailzies was over. Down in the valley spring had fairly set  in, but when we reached the top of the hill, we found snow still  lying on the ground and in deep drifts in the hollows. The  evening was still very warm, and the birds in the woods were  singing in praise of spring. When we came near the Ask Dairy, 2  where we intended to spend the night, we turned off into Skjoer-  sjohaug, a hill well known to every sportsman who has roamed  through these woods. We made for this hill for the purpose of  finding out where the capercailzies went to roost for the night.  When we reached the top of the hill we had a fine view before us.  The sun was about to set, and cast his golden beams across a  cloudless sky. The landscape before us was not of a friendly or  inviting character ; dark forests stretched interminably over the</paragraph>

He begins his play with a call something resembling, Pellcr,  peller, peller, which he repeats at short intervals for about a minute ; he then  makes a sort of gobble in his throat, and finishes with snapping his beak. During  the latter part of his performance, his head is thrown up, his eyes are partially  closed, and his faculties much absorbed. This is the best time to approach him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='554'>2 In the summer months the Norwegian farmers send their cattle up to their  mountain pastures, very often many miles from the farmhouses.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='585'>"I\"ll tell you all about him," said the captain quickly, as we  started on our way for the dairy. He was apparently afraid that  this curt, ill-timed question of mine would, after the short ac-  quaintance I had with Peter, create a suspicion in his mind and  probably silence him altogether. "I\"ll tell you about him," con-  tinued the captain, " there is an old capercailzie cock on this pairing  ground, which has become the talk of the whole parish,  a sort of  a goblin-bird in fact. The sportsmen about here call h ; m the  \"bleater/ for instead of sitting quiet on his branch and playing,  he flies often about between the top of the fir-trees, bleating like a  goat. Not before this performance is over does he settle down to  play, and commence gobbling and snapping his beak. Well, that  kind of playing, there\"s little sense in, and nobody can come within  shot of him. lie plays us, however, still oftener another trick, which  is still worse ; he sits quietly and plays, and he commences his  gobbling, but when he ought to begin his snapoing, he flies to  another tree. If anybody by chance happens to hit him, the shot  has no effect. Our friend Peter here, has shot at him both with  salt and silver, but although the feathers flew out, he didn\"t seem  to take any more notice of the shot than if the charge had been a  blank one. The next morning he played away as fast as ever and  out of tune as usual."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='586'>" You might as well shoot at a stone," said Peter, with the  decisive tone of one fully convinced. " I came across him once,"  he continued, " when he was playing down on the main road to  Skaug; there he sat in the middle of the road with a lot of hens  around him t  I counted seven, and there were more round about in  the wood, for I heard them clucking and calling behind every bush.

All at once he  stuck his tail up and spread it out like a fan, swept the ground  with his wings, and jumped right up in the a&amp;gt; as high as this.  Well, I didn"t know it was that fellaw, else I would have had a  shot at him at once ; before he had time to make himself shot-proof,  but I thought it was great fun to watch him. But while he was in  the middle of the play, another cock, a big one, though not quite  as big as the old one, came sweeping down and wanted to join in  the play. Then came the real fun ! The old one stuck up his tail,  and his beard stuck out like the teeth in a carding-comb ; he  snapped and grated his beak, till he set my teeth on edge,  and the   new comer, he answered the challenge. He was a bold one to be  sure. But then our old friend rushed at him, and when their beaks  and wings met, the crash sounded all over the wood. The next  moment they jumped up at each other and fought with their beaks,  their wings, and their claws, and they were so wicked that they  nearly lost all sense and feeling, and I thought I could almost walk-  up and catch them both with my hands. But at last the old cock  got hold of the other by the nape of the neck and beat him and  knocked him about in such a way till I fancied I heard him squeak.  I couldn"t help pitying the poor bird, who was being lugged about  by the top of his head in this way. The old one crushed him to  the ground and kept him under him till he almost came sliding out  over the hillside on top of him, close to where I was standing.  Then I put up my gun in an instant. There was a report, and the  strange bird lay dead on the spot, but the old one stuck to him  and kept pulling at him ; he did not even move his wings. Aha !  I thought, if you are so sure in your hold, you shall soon be mine !  I loaded again and was just going to take aim at him, when he  gave himself a shake and flew straight up in the air.

It was a cold, sharp morning ;  there was a thin crust on the snow, so that it crackled beneath  our tread. The sky was, however, clear and blue, and a few white  clouds which were quietly drifting towards us from the south,  predicted an early end to the chilly night air. The moon stood  low on the horizon, and instead of lighting us on our nocturnal  expedition, it only threw a faint light on the distant hills and  the tops of the trees, while it created that mysterious twilight  between the tall fir trees which lengthens the shadows intermin-  ably, and calls forth ghostly figures between the trunks of the  trees, and makes the forest so mysterious, so deep and awe-  inspiring.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='704'>The robin alone by his soft morning song broke the silence and  the solitude which reigned in the forest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='705'>" There\"s the bird singing who is the first to wake up in the  morning," said Peter. " It won\"t be long now, before the whole  forest is alive and stirring ; we had better hurry on a bit."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='706'>" There\"s plenty of time, my dear <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;plenty;time;captain;capercailzie;hill;bog;t;play' adjectives='best;much;cold' verbs='\;say;play;don;think;have;be'>Peter</entity>," said the captain ;  "the capercailzie plays best on the hill between here and the  <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;plenty;time;captain;capercailzie;hill;bog;t;play' adjectives='best;much;cold' verbs='\;say;play;don;think;have;be'>Londals</entity> bog, and I don\"t think we shall have much of the play  this morning ; it is too cold."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='707'>" We shall have it much warmer towards the morning," answered  Peter rather positively ; " there is a southerly draught in the air,  and I think we shall have some fine play, as the nights have lately  been so chilly. When the sun rises we shall have some splendid  play. Only hear the woodcock, how he is roading ; he expects fine  weather. There is the snipe drumming also. We shall have it  fine !" he added, with an air of conviction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='708'>We heard the peculiar note of the woodcock, which resembles  the repeated croaking of the frog, followed by a sharp hissing sound,  somewhat like the noisy chirping of the wagtail ; by the faint light</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='712'>of the setting moon we saw one shadow after the other of these  birds passing over the tops of the trees. We heard the unpleasant  braying of the snipe, now near to us, now far off, now high up  in the air, now right over our heads, and suddenly it seemed close  to our ears, now on all sides, still without our being able to catch  sight of the bird. But the shrill wild cry of the heron overpowcied  the cries of all the other birds, whom it seemed to terrify ; they were  silent the moment they heard it, and a silence followed which made  the interruption doubly unpleasant. At this moment the woodlark  commenced his morning song with his clear ringing notes, which in  the darkness of the night reminded us of the bright approaching  dawn, and formed a cheerful contrast to the ghostly flight and un-  pleasant notes of the nocturnal birds.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='713'>" There goes the capercailzie bell, as the Swedes call this merry  little bird," said the captain. " As soon as he starts singing, the  capercailzie commences its morning hymn in its roosting-placc.  Let us remain here a while ; we are not far away from the birds  that came to roost so late last night. By going nearer we  might easily frighten them away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='714'>After having listened for a few minutes, we heard a capercailzie  playing a couple of hundred paces off.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='715'>" I almost think it is the fellow that came last and snapped his  beak," said Peter ; " I really wonder if he won\"t get a dressing.  The old one hasn\"t generally a short memory."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='716'>The captain gave me the choice of going in the direction where  we heard the bird playing, or of going more to the north where he  expected the younger birds were roosting. I chose the first, and  the captain went in a northerly direction. Peter and I quietly  approached the capercailzie, and carefully avoided making any  noise by treading on the snow or the dry crackling branches.  Every time we heard the bird commence the first part of his love-  song we stopped for a moment, but as soon as he had done the  gobble and began snapping his beak we advanced rapidly two or  three paces each time. When he went on with the first strain  again, and while he did the gobble, we remained of course motion-  less. When we in this manner had arrived within a distance of</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='719'>forty or fifty paces from the tree where he was sitting, we heard  the flight of another bird, which settled down in the tree with a  great noise. The sound of clashing beaks and wings soon told us</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='720'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='721'>that our old friend had paid the visit which Peter had predicted,  to the stranger, his rival, on the morning roost. During the fight,  we ran forward a few paces, but a heavy, rushing flight betokened  an easy victory, and the stranger flew away. All was now quiet</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='725'>for a time, but a hen was soon heard cackling, and immediately  the old capercailzie cock commenced playing; he went through  the first part and did his gobble, but as soon as we moved a foot  to get nearer, he flew to another tree, where he commenced his  deceitful play anew.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='726'>" I thought as much," said Peter with some vexation. " Now he  is at it again I It\"s no use whatever to stalk him ; one might as  well try to stalk the clouds. No, let us go more to the north ;  there are more birds thereabouts, and I dare say there is one  amongst them anyhow, who dares open his beak, although they  are all afraid of that beast there ! I wish Old <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='old' verbs='wish;have'>Nick</entity> had him."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='729'>" We will go there," said I ; " but since you think it advisable,  we will first go a little to the north."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='730'>We walked for some distance in this direction, but we did not  hear a single bird play. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bird;conclusion;fight;scare;mouth' adjectives='much;such' verbs='wonder;have;become;come;have;frighten;give;dare;open'>Peter</entity> wondered very much what could  have become of the birds, and came finally to the conclusion that  the fight had frightened them away, or given them such a scare  that they dared not open their mouths.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='731'>Just as the day was breaking we heard a report of a gun north  of Sandtjaern hill, where Peter told me the captain and he used  to have bear-bait set. This place was not far away from his  dairy on the mountains or from his home in Sognedale. Soon  afterwards we heard another report, which, like its predecessor,  Peter declared, came from the captain\"s gun.

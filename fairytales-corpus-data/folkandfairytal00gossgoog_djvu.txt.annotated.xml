	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='86'>THREE names in the living literature of Norway may be  said to have escaped from the provinciality of a narrow home-  circle, and to have conquered a place for themselves in the  general European ooncert. Two of these,  Ibsen and Bjornson,   are borne by professional poets ; the third is that of a man  of science whose irresistible bias towards literary style may be  said to have made a poet of him against his will. The  novelettes of Bjornson and the comedies of Ibsen belong to  the tradition of imaginative art, but the stories of Asbjornsen  a selection from which is here introduced to the English public,  in some sense inaugurated a new order in literature.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>or made a walking tour up into the mountains, the fondest  object of the journey was to coax a story out of every peasant  whom they met. Asbjornsen soon surpassed Moe in the width  of his experience ; his profession was one which took him  habitually from one end of the kingdom to the other, whereas  his friend, with a genius perhaps more naturally attuned than  his to the music of mountain and cascade, settled down as a  country parson into a narrower and more humdrum circle.  Yet it is Moe, and specially in that delightful study of his  entitled Blind Anne, who has given us the most complete and  vivid sketch of the mode in which the friends collected the  materials for their books. In 1838 Asbjornsen first made public  the results of his investigations, very shyly and timorously, in  a little publication for children, called Nor. Not until 1842  did the first authorised edition of Norwegian Folk and Fairy  Tales, collected by Peter Christen Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe,  see the light at Christiania ; it gradually became widely suc-  cessful, and was followed in 1871 by a new selection, from the  pen of Asbjornsen alone. In the mean time, as early as 1845,  Asbjornsen had published his well-known volume of Huldre-  eventyr, or stories about the nymphs or sirens which haunt  the high, sparse woods and mountain dairies. Of these also a  second selection was printed in 1848. The present gathering of  tales, therefore, is a nosegay plucked from these four gardens  of the imagination, wild plots full of strange Alpine blossoms,  and perfumed with the wind from the pine-forest.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='104'>Until the generation now lately passed away, almost the  only mode in which the Norwegian peasant killed time in the  leisure moments between his daily labour and his religious  observances, was in listening to stories. It was the business  of old men and women who had reached the extreme limit of  their working powers, to retain and repeat these ancient legends  in prose and verse, and to recite or sing them when called upon  to do so. Such minstrels were held in great respect, and were  found in every parish. Moe has observed that there was a  certain distinction in the themes selected by the two sexes ;  from the old women there was required a grim or melancholy  class of story, while the old men were called upon for more  humorous tales and staves. Asbjornsen and Moe were only  just in time to preserve the stories from extinction ; in many  districts they had already ceased to exist, in others they  remained solely in the memories of a few very aged persons.  One or two valleys in Thelemarken, the Assynt of Norway,  that district at the back of Kongsberg where the scanty popu-  lation still shrinks from the transforming touch of modern life,  supplied the richest treasure in folk-lore ; wherever the explorers  could hear of belt-fights within the memory of man, there they  were sure of* being on the edge of the more ancient civilization,  and safe to find the rare product they were seeking. On the  other hand, in modernised and Europeanised provinces like  Hardanger, where much intercourse by sea with strangers had  destroyed the antique isolation, the stories were less abundant,</paragraph>

It was from minstrels at  bridal- feasts, from boatmen on the fjords, from old blind vaga-  bonds and the household paupers who form so strange a  feature of a Norse peasant community, that they obtained  most of their best stories ; and it is a significant fact that  almost all these professional reciters are now dead.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>The stories must now be left to speak for themselves. Of  the wonderful links that comparative mythology has found in  them, chains that bind Norway in one brotherhood with Ireland  and Germany, with Wallachia and Hindustan, nothing needs  be said in a popular selection like the present. The stories |  are charming as tales of primitive Norse life, and if mythologists  can find by dissecting them an undergrowth of ancient history,  that is an additional pleasure for them. It is difficult to doubt  that though Asbjornsen is himself a learned saw in this species  of science, it is mainly the tale that has delighted him, the  quaint wit, the savage pathos, the intimate and tender sympathy  with all that is wild and solitary in the nature of his fatherland.  And as a literary artist this is his highest praise, that he has  contrived to lay the peculiarities of Norwegian landscape  before his readers with a subtlety of touch such as no other  poet or proseman has achieved  not by description so much as  by a series of those sympathetic and brilliant touches whic 1 *</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='125'>-IE wind was whistling through the old lime and  maple trees opposite my windows, the snow was  sweeping down the street, and the sky was black as a December  sky can possibly be here in Christiania. I was in just as black  a mood. It was Christmas Eve, the first I was to spend away  from the cosy fireside of my home. I had lately received my  officer"s commission, and had hoped that I should have gladdened  my aged parents with my presence during the holidays, and  had also hoped that I should be able to show myself in all my  glory and splendour to tin ladies of our parish. But a fever had  brought me to the hospital, which I had left only a week before,  and now I found mysc! f in the much-extolled state of convalescence,  I had written home for a horse and sledge and my father"s fur  coat, but my letter could scarcely reach our valley before the  day after Christmas, and the horse could not be in town before  New Year"s Eve.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='129'>My comrades had all left town, and I knew no family with  whom I could make myself at home during the holidays. The two  old maids I lodged with were certainly very kind and friendly  people, and they had taken great care of me in the commencement  of my illness, but the peculiar ways and habits of these ladies were  too much of the old school to prove attractive to the fancies of  youth. Their thoughts dwelt mostly on the past, and when they,  as often might occur, related to me some stories of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='story;people;age;custom;thought;way;contents' adjectives='simple;unaffected;related' verbs='dwell;be;occur;render;remind' valence='5.68619047619' arousal='3.94285714286' dominance='5.42380952381'>the town</entity>, its  people and its customs, these stories reminded me, not only by their  contents, but also by the simple unaffected way in which they were  rendered, of a past age.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>The antiquated appearance of these ladies was also in the strictest  harmony with the house in which they lived. It was one of those  old houses in Custom-house Street, with deep windows, long dark  passages and staircases, gloomy rooms and garrets, where one could  not help thinking of ghosts and brownies ; in short, just such a house,  and perhaps it was the very one, which Mauritz Hansen has de-  scribed in his story, The Old Dame with the Hood. Their circle  of acquaintances was very limited; besides a married sister and  Iut children, no other visitors came there but a couple of tiresome  old ladies. The only relief to this kind of life was a pretty niece  and some merry little cousins of hers, who always made me tell  thrni fairy tales and stories.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='131'>I tried to divert myself in my loneliness and melancholy mood  by looking out at all the people who passed up and down the street  in the snow and wind with blue noses and half-shut eyes. It  amused me to see the bustle and the life in the apothecary"s shop  across the street. The door was scarcely shut for a moment.  Servants and peasants streamed in and out, and commenced to  .study the labels and directions when they came out in the street.  Some appeared to be able to make them out, but sometimes a  lengthy study and a dubious shake of the head showed that the  .solution was too difficult. It was growing dusk. I could not  distinguish the countenances any longer, but gazed across at the  old building. The apothecary"s house, " The Swan/" as it is still  called, stood there with its dark, reddish-brown walls, its pointed</paragraph>

The Swan looked then as now a most resectable and  sedate bird, with its gold ring around the neck, its spur-boots  and its wings stretched out as if ready to fly. I was about to  plunge myself into reflection on imprisoned birds, when I was</paragraph>

That asylum  is a dark and dismal place, I can tell you. Well, when Kari came  there she was cook, and a very smart and clever girl she was. She  had one day to get up very early in the morning to brew, when  the other servants said to her : " You had better mind you don"t  get up too early, and you mustn"t put any fire under the copper  before two o"clock." " Why ? " she asked. " Don"t you know there  is a brownie here ; and you ought to know that these people don"t  like to be disturbed so early/ they said, "and before two o"clock  you mustn"t light the fire by any means/ "Is that all ?" said Kari ;  she was anything but chicken-hearted. " I have nothing to do with  that brownie of yours, but if he comes in my way, why, by my  faith, I will send him head over heeis through the door." The  others warned her, but she did not care a bit, and next morning,  just as the clock struck one, she got up and lighted the fire  under the copper in the brew-house. But the fire went out every  moment. Somebody appeared to be throwing the logs about  on the hearth, but sri ; could not see who it was. She gathered  the logs together one time after the other, but it was of no  use and the chimney would not draw either. She got tired of  this at last, took a burning log and ran round the room with it,  swinging it high and low while she shouted: "Be gone, be gone  whence you came! If you think you can frighten me, you are  mistaken." " Girse you !

I have neither seen  one nor the other,  of course I have not been so very much about  in my lifetime, but I believe it is all nonsense. But old Stine out  in the kitchen there, she says she has seen the brownie. About  the time when I was confirmed, she was in service with my parents.  She came to us from a captain"s, who had given up the sea. It was  a very quiet place. They never went anywhere, and nobody came  to see them. The captain only took a walk as far as the quay  every day. They always went to bed early. People said there  was a brownie in the house. Well, it so happened that Stine and  the cook were sitting in their room one evening, mending and  darning their things ; it was near bedtime, for the watchman had  already sung out " Ten o"clock," but somehow the darning and  the sewing went on very slowly indeed ; every moment "Jack Nap"  came and played his tricks upon them ! At one moment Stine was  nodding and nodding, and then came the cook"s turn  they could  not keep their eyes open ; they had been early up that morning to  wash clothes. But just as they were sitting thus, they heard a  terrible crash down stairs in the kitchen and Stine shouted : " Lor*  bless and preserve us ! it must be the brownie." She was so  frightened she dared scarcely move a foot, but at last the cook  plucked up courage and went down into the kitchen, closely  followed by Stine. When they opened the kitchen door, they  found all the crockery on the floor, but none of it broken, while the  brownie was standing on the big kitchen table with his red cap on  and hurling the one dish after the other on to the floor and laughing  in great glee. The cook had heard that the brownies could some-  times be tricked into moving to another house, when anybody  would tell them of a very quiet place, and as she long had been  wishing for an opportunity to play a trick upon this brownie, she  took courage and spoke to him  her voice was a little shaky at  the time that he ought to remove to the tinman"s over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='house;anybody;brownie;trick;s;courage;place;time;cook;tinman;voice;opportunity' adjectives='pleasant;little;shaky;quiet' verbs='be;play;wish;move;remove;trick;hear;take;have;go;tell;speak' valence='5.87078947368' arousal='3.93921052632' dominance='5.46736842105'>the way</entity>,  where it was so very quiet and pleasant, because they always went</paragraph>

Since that day  they never saw the brownie any more at the captain"s. Ke seemed  to feel quite at home at the tinman"s, although they were hammering  and tapping away there all day, but people said that the gudewife put  a dish of porridge up in the garret for him every Thursday evening;  and it"s no wonder that they got on well and became rich when  they had a brownie in the house.

She threw the cloak loosely round her, as the female next to her  had said, and went out of the pew ; but she thought they all turned  round and stretched out their hands after her.

When she came out on the steps, she felt that they had got hold of  her cloak ; she let it go and left it in their clutches, while she  hurried home as quickly as she could. When she came to the door  the clock struck one, and by the time she got inside she was nearly  half dead  she was that frightened. In the morning, when the  people went to church, they found the cloak lying on the steps  but it was torn into a thousand pieces.

They had crept up  into the sofa and on the chairs, but still they thought they felt  somebody plucking at them from underneath the table. Suddenly  the lights were brought in, and we discovered then to our great  amusement that the children had put their legs on to the table. The  lights, the Christmas cake, the jellies, the tarts, and the wine soon  chased away the horrible ghost story and all fear from their minds,  revived everybody"s spirits, and brought the conversation on to  their neighbours and the topics of the day. Finally our thoughts  took a flight towards something more substantial on the appearance  of the Christmas porridge and the roast ribs of pork. We broke Up  early and parted with the best wishes for a Merry Christmas. I  passed however a very uneasy night. I do not know whether  it was the stories, the substantial supper, my weak condition,  or all these combined, which was the cause of it ; I tossed myself  hither and thither in my bed and got mixed up with brownies,  fairies, and ghosts the whole night. Finally I sailed through the  air towards the church, while some merry sledge bells were  ringing in my ears. The church was lighted up, and when I came  inside I saw it was our own church up in the valley. There were  nobody there but peasants in their red caps, soldiers in full  uniform, country lasses with their white head-dresses and red  cheeks. The minister was in the pulpit ; it was my grandfather,  who died when. I was a little boy. But just as he was in the  middle of the sermon, he made a somersault  he was known  as one of the smartest men in the parish  right into the middle  of the church ; the surplice flew one way and the collar another.  "There lies the parson, and here am I," he said, with one of his  well known airs, " and now let us have a spring-dance ! " In an  instant the whole congregation was in the midst of a wild dance ;  a big tall peasant came towards me and took me by the shoulder  and said : " You"ll have to join us, my lad ! "</paragraph>

So the  giant could not refuse to tell her  any longer, and he said : " Far, far  away in a lake !ies an island,   on that island stands a church,   in. that church there is a well,   in that well swims a duck,  in that  duck there is an egg,  and in the  e gg  well, there is my heart."</paragraph>

We were to try for a hare, as soon as our sport with the  capercailzies was over. Down in the valley spring had fairly set  in, but when we reached the top of the hill, we found snow still  lying on the ground and in deep drifts in the hollows. The  evening was still very warm, and the birds in the woods were  singing in praise of spring. When we came near the Ask Dairy, 2  where we intended to spend the night, we turned off into Skjoer-  sjohaug, a hill well known to every sportsman who has roamed  through these woods. We made for this hill for the purpose of  finding out where the capercailzies went to roost for the night.  When we reached the top of the hill we had a fine view before us.  The sun was about to set, and cast his golden beams across a  cloudless sky.

During  the latter part of his performance, his head is thrown up, his eyes are partially  closed, and his faculties much absorbed. This is the best time to approach him.</paragraph>

"I"ll tell you about him," con-  tinued the captain, " there is an old capercailzie cock on this pairing  ground, which has become the talk of the whole parish,  a sort of  a goblin-bird in fact. The sportsmen about here call h ; m the  "bleater/ for instead of sitting quiet on his branch and playing,  he flies often about between the top of the fir-trees, bleating like a  goat. Not before this performance is over does he settle down to  play, and commence gobbling and snapping his beak. Well, that  kind of playing, there"s little sense in, and nobody can come within  shot of him. lie plays us, however, still oftener another trick, which  is still worse ; he sits quietly and plays, and he commences his  gobbling, but when he ought to begin his snapoing, he flies to  another tree. If anybody by chance happens to hit him, the shot  has no effect. Our friend Peter here, has shot at him both with  salt and silver, but although the feathers flew out, he didn"t seem  to take any more notice of the shot than if the charge had been a  blank one.

" I came across him once,"  he continued, " when he was playing down on the main road to  Skaug; there he sat in the middle of the road with a lot of hens  around him t  I counted seven, and there were more round about in  the wood, for I heard them clucking and calling behind every bush.

All at once he  stuck his tail up and spread it out like a fan, swept the ground  with his wings, and jumped right up in the a&amp;gt; as high as this.  Well, I didn"t know it was that fellaw, else I would have had a  shot at him at once ; before he had time to make himself shot-proof,  but I thought it was great fun to watch him. But while he was in  the middle of the play, another cock, a big one, though not quite  as big as the old one, came sweeping down and wanted to join in  the play. Then came the real fun ! The old one stuck up his tail,  and his beard stuck out like the teeth in a carding-comb ; he  snapped and grated his beak, till he set my teeth on edge,  and the   new comer, he answered the challenge. He was a bold one to be  sure. But then our old friend rushed at him, and when their beaks  and wings met, the crash sounded all over the wood. The next  moment they jumped up at each other and fought with their beaks,  their wings, and their claws, and they were so wicked that they  nearly lost all sense and feeling, and I thought I could almost walk-  up and catch them both with my hands. But at last the old cock  got hold of the other by the nape of the neck and beat him and  knocked him about in such a way till I fancied I heard him squeak.  I couldn"t help pitying the poor bird, who was being lugged about  by the top of his head in this way. The old one crushed him to  the ground and kept him under him till he almost came sliding out  over the hillside on top of him, close to where I was standing.  Then I put up my gun in an instant. There was a report, and the  strange bird lay dead on the spot, but the old one stuck to him  and kept pulling at him ; he did not even move his wings. Aha !  I thought, if you are so sure in your hold, you shall soon be mine !  I loaded again and was just going to take aim at him, when he  gave himself a shake and flew straight up in the air. If he was  further than ten steps from me, may I never in my life shoot a  bird again.</paragraph>

But the shrill wild cry of the heron overpowcied  the cries of all the other birds, whom it seemed to terrify ; they were  silent the moment they heard it, and a silence followed which made  the interruption doubly unpleasant. At this moment the woodlark  commenced his morning song with his clear ringing notes, which in  the darkness of the night reminded us of the bright approaching  dawn, and formed a cheerful contrast to the ghostly flight and un-  pleasant notes of the nocturnal birds.</paragraph>

The sun was rising ; it gilt the  hill tops and gradually threw its lustre over the dark pine forests  on the mountain slopes.

It was truly  a splendid bird  a noble animal  as it sat there against the sky on  the naked branch, with its shining, bright green breast glittering in  the sunlight. A hen now came flying and settled in the tree above  our heads. At this moment the cock began to play ; he stuck out  his beard, trailed his wings down by his legs, and made, with great  solemnity and wavelike motions of his neck, a few steps forward on  the branch, while he stuck up his tail and spread it out like a big  wheel. I was waiting with my finger on the trigger for the de-  cisive moment when he would spread out his wings for flight, and  thereby give me a much larger target, at which I at this long dis-  tance could make a surer shot. But while the hen continued her  cackle he finished his first play, and had commenced the gobble of  his second, when a twig cracked beneath my feet. The hen uttered  a sharp warning cry, but our old friend was in such an ecstasy, that  he took no notice of her well-meant warning, and was finishing his  love-song, when his faithful mistress flew straight at him, apparently  with the intention of pushing him off the branch. This recalled  him to his senses, and he spread his wings out to take .flight ; but  my gun was up, and the mighty bird fell head foremost down on  the bog. It was an easy death ; he only flapped his wings once  or twice.</paragraph>

In a while the farmer met the  fox, " Have you seen anj^horse and sledge ? " asked the farmer.   " Yes," answered Reynard, " but old Bruin sat on the sledge and  drove just as if he had stolen both horse and turn-out. ,,  " Bad  luck to him, the rascal ! " said the farmer. " I suppose he will  drive my horse to death."  M If he does, take and skin him and  roast him on the cinders," said Reynard ; " but if you should get  your horse back again, you might give me a ride over the mountain  one day ; I have such a mind to try what it"s like to have four  legs before me."  "What will you give for the lift? "asked the  farmer.  " Oh, anything you like, wet or dry," said the fox ;  " you"ll always get as much out of me as of old Bruin, for he is  generally a rough fellow to deal with, when he goes a-driving and  sticks to the horse"s back."  " Well, yes ! you shall have a lift over  the mountain," said the farmer, " if you"ll meet me here to-morrow  about this time." He guessed that Reynard was going to make a  fool of him and play off some of his tricks upon him ; so he took a  loaded gun with him in the sledge next day, and when Reynard  came, thinking to get the drive promised him for nothing, he got a  charge of shot in his body. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fox-skin;bear-skin;bear' adjectives='' verbs='flay;have' valence='5.7975' arousal='3.8025' dominance='5.2825'>The farmer</entity> flayed him as he had  the bear, and so he had both bear-skin and fox-skin.</paragraph>

The hare cried and complained of  the terrible February cold and the disgusting chatter of the owls ;  the fox was out on love-adventures, abused his rivals, and uttered  scoffing screams and howls.</paragraph>

Seeing by the gun and the fox, which I carried on my  back, that I was a sportsman, he entered into conversation with me.  If I hurried down to the river, he said, I should be sure to fall in  with a pack of wolves, for just as he was driving up the hill close  to the sound, they started up the river on the ice. I thanked him  for the information, and made for the river, and came out at a  point where a pine wood stretched itself down to the river"s edge,  and prevented a full view of the river. I saw no signs of the  wolves. I rushed, however, down the hill on my snow-shoes,  sweeping through the wood in the shadow of the pine-trees, with  the protruding alder branches continually slapping me in the face.  It was impossible for me to distinguish any object, as I sped on  with the swiftness of an arrow, and before I knew where I was I  had run against the stump of a tree.

He and two others were once living thus in the  forest. He had just felled a big tree, and sat resting himself on  it, when a ball of worsted came rolling down a bare part of the  rock right before his feet. He thought it was very strange ; he  was afraid to pick up the ball. It would have been a good thing  for him if he never had touched it. But he looked up the moun-  tain, as he wanted to see where it came from, and on the top  of a rock sat a lassie and sewed. She was so fair and so lovely  that the air seemed to shine round her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1008'>"Bring me that ball of worsted," she said. He did so, and  remained standing near her and looking at her. He thought he  never should tire looking at her; she seemed so lovely to him.  But he had to take his axe at last and begin cutting trees again.  When he had been working away for some time, he looked up,  but then she was gone. He could not help thinking of her all  day ; it seemed very strange to him, and he did not know what  to think about it. But when the evening came, and he and his  two comrades were going to bed, he wanted to lie between them ;  but there was not much help in that, I should say, for during  the night the huldre came and took him away with her. He  had to go, whether he liked or not. So they came into the moun-  tain, where he found everything so splendid that he had never seen  anything so grand before, and he never could describe it properly.  He was three days with the huldre. The third night he awoke  and found himself in bed between his two comrades again. They  thought he had been home for provisions, and he told them he had  done so. But he was not quite in his right senses afterwards ; just  as he was sitting down, he would jump up and run away ; he was  spellbound, I can tell you.</paragraph>

He was driving a wedge into a big  log, when, as he thought, his wife came up to him with his dinner.  It was cream porridge, floating in butter. She brought it in a pail,  which was so bright that it shone like silver. She sat down on the  log, while he put his axe aside and seated himself on a stump near  her; but he then discovered that there was a cow"s tail hanging  down into the cleft in the log.</paragraph>

All of a  sudden, while he was walking through the forest, he found himself  inside a hut with some people, but he never knew how he came  there. An ugly old hag was walking about the room tidying it  up, and in a corner sat a child, who might be about four years old.  The woman took the beer-tankard and went over to the child with  it and said : " Go and give your father a drink !

But before long the  cattle began to be so restless that it was impossible to manage  them. They set one young lass after the other to watch them, but  there was no peace to be had till they got a young woman who  had just been engaged. The cattle suddenly became quiet, and it  was no trouble to look after them after that time. She was there  all by herself with the exception of a dog. She was sitting in the  dairy one afternoon, when her sweetheart, as she thought, came in  and sat alongside her, and began speaking about their wedding.  But she sat quite silent and made no answer, for she began to feel  so strange. By and by more people came in, and they began to  lay the table and put all sorts of dishes and silver plate on it.  The bridesmaids brought in the bridal crown, the silver ornaments,  and a fine wedding gown, which they put on her. They put the  crown on her head, as was usual at that time, and on her fingers  they put rings.</paragraph>

He had made a  bargain with the devil that he should belong to him after seven  years, if he during that time was to be the master over all masters  in his profession. Both he and the devil had put their names to  this contract. So the smith wrote with great letters over the  smithy door : " Here lives the master over all masters."</paragraph>

Before the saint could answer him a man  came with his horse, which he asked the smith to shoe for him.  " Will you let me shoe it ? " asked the saint " You may try," said  the smith ; " you cannot do it so badly but I shall be able to put it  right again." The saint went out and took one leg off the horse  and put it in the fire on the forge and made the shoe red hot ; he  then sharpened the points, clenched the nails, and put the leg back  in its place again. When he had done with that leg, he took the  other fore-leg, and did the same with it ; and when he had put  that in its place, he took the hind-legs, first the right and then the  left, put them in the fire, made the shoes red hot, sharpened the  points and clenched the nails, and then he put them on the horse  again. The smith stood and looked on all the while. "You are  not such a bad smith after all," he said. " Ah, you think so," said  the saint.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1064'>Just then the smith"s mother came across to the smithy and  asked him to come home and eat his dinner ; she was very old,  and had a crooked back and big wrinkles in her face, and she was  scarcely able to walk.</paragraph>

This was not exactly to his liking, but at that moment a poor old  woman, who went about begging, came past, and he thought if  one thing does not succeed another may. So he took the old  woman and put her in the fire, and although she cried and begged  for her life, it was of no use. "You don"t know what is good for  you, although you are so old," said the smith; "I will make a  young woman of you in half a minute, and I shan"t charge as much  as a penny for the job."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1071'>It fared no better with .e poor old woman than with the horse"s  legs. Just then the saints came round again to him. "That was  ill done," said the saint.

" If you might have three wishes from me," said the saint,  "what would you wish for yourself?" "Try me," answered the  smith, "and you will get to know."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1072'>The saint then gave him three wishes. " First of all, I wish  that when I ask anybody to climb up in the pear-tree just outside  the smithy, he must sit there till I myself ask him to come down  again," said the smith. " Secondly, I wish that any one whom I  ask to sit down in the arm-chair in the smithy there, must remain  in it till I myself ask him to get up ; and, last of all, I wish that if I  ask anybody to creep into the steel-ring purse which I have in my  pocket, he must remain there till I give him leave to creep out  again."</paragraph>

Just at this point he overtook a tailor, who was hurrying  along with his smoothing-iron in his hand. "* Good day/" said the  smith, " where are you off to ?

"  " Well, I shan"t have  the pleasure of your company for long then," answered the smith ;  " I have made up my mind to try the other place first, because I  happen to know the old man a little already."

But the lad had no mind to spend the  autumn nights on salt water; however, he would stay on board till  the cargo was in and they were ready to sail.

But it  was apparent that we could not escape the storm ; the seas in-  creased, the current carried us towards land, and only now and then  a gust of wind filled our sail. By the last glimmer of the day we  saw on the distant ridge of the horizon a black streak approaching  us, the nearer it came the plainer appeared the white fringe of foam  which came driving on before it. The storm and the dark night  were upon us. Like an arrow the boat sped on, and before long we  were by the outside skerries, where the sea-birds, disturbed at the  constant flashes of lightning and claps of thunder, wheezed and  screamed and flew about in swarms like white clouds. But their  screams sounded faint amongst the breakers. The islands and  skerries afforded us some shelter from the heavy seas, but further on  towards the shore, where the sea broke upon it, they grew again,  and by the light of the flashes of lightning we saw along the whole  coast high foaming breakers, the roaring of which thundered in our  ears. Rasmus kept a sharp look-out in this darkness, which  appeared almost impenetrable; I could not distinguish anything  but the broad white fringe of foam, which we were approaching  with an alarming speed. Shortly I discerned a small dark point,  for which we steered, and in a few moments we passed among the  surf and breakers through the narrow sound by the Ullenhead, and  reached in safety the peaceful harbour, where the high cliffs  sheltered against storm and sea.</paragraph>

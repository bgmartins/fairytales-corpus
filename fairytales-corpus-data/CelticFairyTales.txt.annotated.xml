	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='12'>PREFACE</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='13'>Last year, in giving the young ones a volume of English Fairy Tales, my difficulty was one of collection. This time, in offering them specimens of the rich folk-fancy of the Celts of these islands, my trouble has rather been one of selection. Ireland began to collect her folk-tales almost as early as any country in Europe, and Croker has found a whole school of successors in Carleton, Griffin, Kennedy, Curtin, and Douglas Hyde. Scotland had the great name of Campbell, and has still efficient followers in MacDougall, MacInnes, Carmichael, Macleod, and Campbell of Tiree. Gallant little Wales has no name to rank alongside these; in this department the Cymru have shown less vigour than the Gaedhel. Perhaps the Eisteddfod, by offering prizes for the collection of Welsh folk-tales, may remove this inferiority. Meanwhile <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tale;tongue' adjectives='content;extinct' verbs='be;contribute;have;represent' valence='5.82153846154' arousal='3.67538461538' dominance='5.75692307692'>Wales</entity> must be content to be somewhat scantily represented among the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tale;tongue' adjectives='content;extinct' verbs='be;contribute;have;represent' valence='5.82153846154' arousal='3.67538461538' dominance='5.75692307692'>Fairy</entity> Tales of the Celts, while the extinct <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tale;tongue' adjectives='content;extinct' verbs='be;contribute;have;represent' valence='5.82153846154' arousal='3.67538461538' dominance='5.75692307692'>Cornish</entity> tongue has only contributed one tale.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='14'>For the more romantic tales I have depended on the Gaelic, and, as I know about as much of Gaelic as an Irish Nationalist M. P., I have had to depend on translators. But I have felt myself more at liberty than the translators themselves, who have generally been over-literal, in changing, excising, or modifying the original. I have even gone further. In order that the tales should be characteristically Celtic, I have paid more particular attention to tales that are to be found on both sides of the North Channel.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='15'>In re-telling them I have had no scruple in interpolating now and then a Scotch incident into an Irish variant of the same story, or _vice versa_. Where the translators appealed to English folklorists and scholars, I am trying to attract English children. They translated; I endeavoured to transfer. In short, I have tried to put myself into the position of an _ollamh_ or _sheenachie_ familiar with both forms of Gaelic, and anxious to put his stories in the best way to attract English children. I trust I shall be forgiven by Celtic scholars for the changes I have had to make to effect this end.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='16'>The stories collected in this volume are longer and more detailed than the English ones I brought together last Christmas. The romantic ones are certainly more romantic, and the comic ones perhaps more comic, though there may be room for a difference of opinion on this latter point. This superiority of the Celtic folk-tales is due as much to the conditions under which they have been collected, as to any innate superiority of the folk-imagination. The folk-tale in England is in the last stages of exhaustion. The Celtic folk-tales have been collected while the practice of story-telling is still in full vigour, though there are every signs that its term of life is already numbered. The more the reason why they should be collected and put on record while there is yet time. On the whole, the industry of the collectors of Celtic folk-lore is to be commended, as may be seen from the survey of it I have prefixed to the Notes and References at the end of the volume. Among these, I would call attention to the study of the legend of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='origin;study;attention;legend' adjectives='' verbs='settle;believe;call;have' valence='5.84416666667' arousal='3.98166666667' dominance='5.73833333333'>Beth Gellert</entity>, the origin of which, I believe, I have settled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='17'>While I have endeavoured to render the language of the tales simple and free from bookish artifice, I have not felt at liberty to retell the tales in the English way. I have not scrupled to retain a Celtic turn of speech, and here and there a Celtic word, which I have _not_ explained within brackets--a practice to be abhorred of all good men. A few words unknown to the reader only add effectiveness and local colour to a narrative, as Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='word;colour;reader;mr.;narrative;effectiveness' adjectives='few;local;unknown' verbs='add;know' valence='6.018' arousal='4.238' dominance='5.801'>Kipling</entity> well knows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='18'>One characteristic of the Celtic folk-lore I have endeavoured to represent in my selection, because it is nearly unique at the present day in Europe. Nowhere else is there so large and consistent a body of oral tradition about the national and mythical heroes as amongst the Gaels. Only the _byline_, or hero-songs of Russia, equal in extent the amount of knowledge about the heroes of the past that still exists among the Gaelic-speaking peasantry of Scotland and Ireland. And the Irish tales and ballads have this peculiarity, that some of them have been extant, and can be traced, for well nigh a thousand years. I have selected as a specimen of this class the Story of Deirdre, collected among the Scotch peasantry a few years ago, into which I have been able to insert a passage taken from an Irish vellum of the twelfth century. I could have more than filled this volume with similar oral traditions about Finn (the Fingal of Macpherson"s "Ossian"). But the story of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='story;hero;volume;adventure;to-day;peasantry' adjectives='' verbs='deserve;tell;fill' valence='6.245' arousal='4.7425' dominance='5.81375'>Finn</entity>, as told by the Gaelic peasantry of to-day, deserves a volume by itself, while the adventures of the Ultonian hero, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='story;hero;volume;adventure;to-day;peasantry' adjectives='' verbs='deserve;tell;fill' valence='6.245' arousal='4.7425' dominance='5.81375'>Cuchulain</entity>, could easily fill another.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='19'>I have endeavoured to include in this volume the best and most typical stories told by the chief masters of the Celtic folk-tale, Campbell, Kennedy, Hyde, and Curtin, and to these I have added the best tales scattered elsewhere. By this means I hope I have put together a volume, containing both the best, and the best known folk-tales of the Celts. I have only been enabled to do this by the courtesy of those who owned the copyright of these stories. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='use;right;mr.;horned;fiction;tale;s;version;messrs.;women' adjectives='legendary;effective' verbs='use;thank;have;grant' valence='5.75684210526' arousal='4.24157894737' dominance='5.56263157895'>Lady Wilde</entity> has kindly granted me the use of her effective version of "The Horned Women;" and I have specially to thank Messrs. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='use;right;mr.;horned;fiction;tale;s;version;messrs.;women' adjectives='legendary;effective' verbs='use;thank;have;grant' valence='5.75684210526' arousal='4.24157894737' dominance='5.56263157895'>Macmillan</entity> for right to use <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='use;right;mr.;horned;fiction;tale;s;version;messrs.;women' adjectives='legendary;effective' verbs='use;thank;have;grant' valence='5.75684210526' arousal='4.24157894737' dominance='5.56263157895'>Kennedy</entity>"s "Legendary Fictions," and Messrs. Sampson Low &amp; Co., for the use of Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='use;right;mr.;horned;fiction;tale;s;version;messrs.;women' adjectives='legendary;effective' verbs='use;thank;have;grant' valence='5.75684210526' arousal='4.24157894737' dominance='5.56263157895'>Curtin</entity>"s Tales.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>In making my selection, and in all doubtful points of treatment, I have had resource to the wide knowledge of my friend Mr. Alfred Nutt in all branches of Celtic folk-lore. If this volume does anything to represent to English children the vision and colour, the magic and charm, of the Celtic folk-imagination, this is due in large measure to the care with which Mr. Nutt has watched its inception and progress. With him by my side I could venture into regions where the non-Celt wanders at his own risk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='21'>Lastly, I have again to rejoice in the co-operation of my friend, Mr. J. D. Batten, in giving form to the creations of the folk-fancy. He has endeavoured in his illustrations to retain as much as possible of Celtic ornamentation; for all details of Celtic archaeology he has authority. Yet both he and I have striven to give Celtic things as they appear to, and attract, the English mind, rather than attempt the hopeless task of representing them as they are to Celts. The fate of the Celt in the British Empire bids fair to resemble that of the Greeks among the Romans. "They went forth to battle, but they always fell," yet the captive Celt has enslaved his captor in the realm of imagination. The present volume attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years. If it could succeed in giving a common fund of imaginative wealth to the Celtic and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;celtic;wealth;union;fund;child;politics;isle' adjectives='imaginative;true;common;more' verbs='do;succeed;give' valence='6.22533333333' arousal='4.55066666667' dominance='5.72066666667'>Saxon</entity> children of these isles, it might do more for a true union of hearts than all your politics.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='46'>CONNLA AND THE FAIRY MAIDEN</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='47'>Connla of the Fiery Hair was son of Conn of the Hundred Fights. One day as he stood by the side of his father on the height of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='attire;father;side;height' adjectives='clad;strange;maiden' verbs='see;come;stand' valence='5.59' arousal='3.6925' dominance='5.41333333333'>Usna</entity>, he saw a maiden clad in strange attire coming towards him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='48'>"Whence comest thou, maiden?" said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='5.91' arousal='4.43' dominance='6.88'>Connla</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='49'>"I come from the Plains of the Ever Living," she said, "there where there is neither death nor sin. There we keep holiday alway, nor need we help from any in our joy. And in all our pleasure we have no strife. And because we have our homes in the round green hills, men call us the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='home;man;round;hill' adjectives='green' verbs='call;have' valence='6.01222222222' arousal='3.36333333333' dominance='5.98444444444'>Hill Folk</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='50'>The king and all with him wondered much to hear a voice when they saw no one. For save Connla alone, none saw the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='connla;none;maiden' adjectives='' verbs='see;save' valence='5.526' arousal='4.378' dominance='5.514'>Fairy</entity> Maiden.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='51'>"To whom art thou talking, my son?" said Conn <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='conn' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='5.955' arousal='4.44' dominance='6.205'>the king</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='52'>Then the maiden answered, "Connla speaks to a young, fair maid, whom neither death nor old age awaits. I love Connla, and now I call him away to the Plain of Pleasure, Moy Mell, where Boadag is king for aye, nor has there been complaint or sorrow in that land since he has held the kingship. Oh, come with me, Connla of the Fiery Hair, ruddy as the dawn with thy tawny skin. A fairy crown awaits thee to grace thy comely face and royal form. Come, and never shall thy comeliness fade, nor thy youth, till the last awful day of judgment."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='53'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fear;name;maiden' adjectives='' verbs='call;say;hear;see' valence='5.655' arousal='4.115' dominance='5.60875'>The king</entity> in fear at what the maiden said, which he heard though he could not see her, called aloud to his Druid, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fear;name;maiden' adjectives='' verbs='call;say;hear;see' valence='5.655' arousal='4.115' dominance='5.60875'>Coran</entity> by name.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='54'>"Oh, Coran of the many spells," he said, "and of the cunning magic, I call upon thy aid. A task is upon me too great for all my skill and wit, greater than any laid upon me since I seized the kingship. A maiden unseen has met us, and by her power would take from me my dear, my comely son. If thou help not, he will be taken from thy king by woman"s wiles and witchery."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='55'>Then Coran the Druid stood forth and chanted his spells towards the spot where the maiden"s voice had been heard. And none heard her voice again, nor could Connla see her longer. Only as she vanished before the Druid"s mighty spell, she threw an apple to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;spell;druid;apple' adjectives='mighty' verbs='vanish;throw' valence='5.52285714286' arousal='4.66714285714' dominance='5.76'>Connla</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>For a whole month from that day Connla would take nothing, either to eat or to drink, save only from that apple. But as he ate it grew again and always kept whole. And all the while there grew within him a mighty yearning and longing after the maiden he had seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='57'>But when the last day of the month of waiting came, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plain;father;side' adjectives='maiden' verbs='see;speak;come;stand;wait' valence='5.55692307692' arousal='3.65307692308' dominance='5.54307692308'>Connla</entity> stood by the side of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plain;father;side' adjectives='maiden' verbs='see;speak;come;stand;wait' valence='5.55692307692' arousal='3.65307692308' dominance='5.54307692308'>the king</entity> his father on the Plain of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='plain;father;side' adjectives='maiden' verbs='see;speak;come;stand;wait' valence='5.55692307692' arousal='3.65307692308' dominance='5.54307692308'>Arcomin</entity>, and again he saw the maiden come towards him, and again she spoke to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='58'>""Tis a glorious place, forsooth, that Connla holds among short-lived mortals awaiting the day of death. But now the folk of life, the ever-living ones, beg and bid thee come to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;life;folk;one' adjectives='ever-living' verbs='bid;beg;see;know;have;learn;come' valence='6.12214285714' arousal='3.88' dominance='5.84285714286'>Moy Mell</entity>, the Plain of Pleasure, for they have learnt to know thee, seeing thee in thy home among thy dear ones."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='59'>When Conn <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;voice;conn;man' adjectives='maiden' verbs='call;say;hear' valence='5.9175' arousal='4.05625' dominance='5.88375'>the king</entity> heard the maiden"s voice he called to his men aloud and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='60'>"Summon swift my <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='speech;power' adjectives='swift' verbs='see;have;summon' valence='5.81125' arousal='4.3875' dominance='5.93'>Druid Coran</entity>, for I see she has again this day the power of speech."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>Then the maiden said: "Oh, mighty Conn, fighter of a hundred fights, the Druid"s power is little loved; it has little honour in the mighty land, peopled with so many of the upright. When the Law will come, it will do away with the Druid"s magic spells that come from the lips of the false black demon."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='62'>Then Conn the king observed that since the maiden came, Connla his son spoke to none that spake to him. So Conn of the hundred fights said to him, "Is it to thy mind what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='son;mind;conn;fight' adjectives='' verbs='be;say' valence='6.0925' arousal='4.45' dominance='5.82875'>the woman</entity> says, my son?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='63'>""Tis hard upon me," then said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;longing;maiden;folk;tis' adjectives='own' verbs='say;love;seize' valence='5.40181818182' arousal='4.38909090909' dominance='5.45727272727'>Connla</entity>; "I love my own folk above all things; but yet, but yet a longing seizes me for the maiden."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>When the maiden heard this, she answered and said "The ocean is not so strong as the waves of thy longing. Come with me in my curragh, the gleaming, straight-gliding crystal canoe. Soon we can reach Boadag"s realm. I see the bright sun sink, yet far as it is, we can reach it before dark. There is, too, another land worthy of thy journey, a land joyous to all that seek it. Only wives and maidens dwell there. If thou wilt, we can seek it and live there alone together in joy."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='65'>When the maiden ceased to speak, Connla of the Fiery Hair rushed away from them and sprang into the curragh, the gleaming, straight-gliding crystal canoe. And then they all, king and court, saw it glide away over the bright sea towards the setting sun. Away and away, till eye could see it no longer, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;way;maiden' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;see;know;go;come' valence='6.16' arousal='3.77583333333' dominance='5.7275'>Connla</entity> and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;way;maiden' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;see;know;go;come' valence='6.16' arousal='3.77583333333' dominance='5.7275'>Fairy</entity> Maiden went their way on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='eye;way;maiden' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;see;know;go;come' valence='6.16' arousal='3.77583333333' dominance='5.7275'>the sea</entity>, and were no more seen, nor did any know where they came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>GULEESH</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>There was once a boy in the County Mayo; Guleesh was his name. There was the finest rath a little way off from the gable of the house, and he was often in the habit of seating himself on the fine grass bank that was running round it. One night he stood, half leaning against the gable of the house, and looking up into the sky, and watching the beautiful white moon over his head. After he had been standing that way for a couple of hours, he said to himself: "My bitter grief that I am not gone away out of this place altogether. I"d sooner be any place in the world than here. Och, it"s well for you, white moon," says he, "that"s turning round, turning round, as you please yourself, and no man can put you back. I wish I was the same as you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='69'>Hardly was the word out of his mouth when he heard a great noise coming like the sound of many people running together, and talking, and laughing, and making sport, and the sound went by him like a whirl of wind, and he was listening to it going into the rath. "<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ll;soul' adjectives='merry' verbs='re;say;follow' valence='5.908' arousal='4.412' dominance='6.07'>Musha</entity>, by my soul," says he, "but ye"re merry enough, and I"ll follow ye."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>What was in it but the fairy host, though he did not know at first that it was they who were in it, but he followed them into the rath. It"s there he heard the _fulparnee_, and the _folpornee_, the _rap-lay-hoota_, and the _roolya-boolya_, that they had there, and every man of them crying out as loud as he could: "My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>"By my hand," said Guleesh, "my boy, that"s not bad. I"ll imitate ye," and he cried out as well as they: "My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!" And on the moment there was a fine horse with a bridle of gold, and a saddle of silver, standing before him. He leaped up on it, and the moment he was on its back he saw clearly that the rath was full of horses, and of little people going riding on them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='72'>Said a man of them to him: "Are you coming with us to-night, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='man' adjectives='to-night' verbs='be;say;come' valence='5.63' arousal='4.158' dominance='5.752'>Guleesh</entity>?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>"If you are, come along," said the little man, and out they went all together, riding like the wind, faster than the fastest horse ever you saw a-hunting, and faster than the fox and the hounds at his tail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='75'>The cold winter"s wind that was before them, they overtook her, and the cold winter"s wind that was behind them, she did not overtake them.

Since she had no other means of talking, she carried on a sort of conversation between herself and himself, by moving her hand and fingers, winking her eyes, opening and shutting her mouth, laughing or smiling, and a thousand other signs, so that it was not long until they understood each other very well. Guleesh was always thinking how he should send her back to her father; but there was no one to go with her, and he himself did not know what road to go, for he had never been out of his own country before the night he brought her away with him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='128'>So they passed the time for a year, until there came a day when Guleesh was lying by himself, on the grass, on the last day of the last month in autumn, and he was thinking over again in his own mind of everything that happened to him from the day that he went with the sheehogues across the sea. He remembered then, suddenly, that it was one November night that he was standing at the gable of the house, when the whirlwind came, and the sheehogues in it, and he said to himself: "We have November night again to-day, and I"ll stand in the same place I was last year, until I see if the good people come again. Perhaps I might see or hear something that would be useful to me, and might bring back her talk again to Mary"--that was the name himself and the priest called the king"s daughter, for neither of them knew her right name. He told his intention to the priest, and the priest gave him his blessing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='129'>Guleesh accordingly went to the old rath when the night was darkening, and he stood with his bent elbow leaning on a grey old flag, waiting till the middle of the night should come. The moon rose slowly; and it was like a knob of fire behind him; and there was a white fog which was raised up over the fields of grass and all damp places, through the coolness of the night after a great heat in the day. The night was calm as is a lake when there is not a breath of wind to move a wave on it, and there was no sound to be heard but the _cronawn_ of the insects that would go by from time to time, or the hoarse sudden scream of the wild-geese, as they passed from lake to lake, half a mile up in the air over his head; or the sharp whistle of the golden and green plover, rising and lying, lying and rising, as they do on a calm night. There were a thousand thousand bright stars shining over his head, and there was a little frost out, which left the grass under his foot white and crisp.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>He stood there for an hour, for two hours, for three hours, and the frost increased greatly, so that he heard the breaking of the _traneens_ under his foot as often as he moved. He was thinking, in his own mind, at last, that the sheehogues would not come that night, and that it was as good for him to return back again, when he heard a sound far away from him, coming towards him, and he recognised what it was at the first moment. The sound increased, and at first it was like the beating of waves on a stony shore, and then it was like the falling of a great waterfall, and at last it was like a loud storm in the tops of the trees, and then the whirlwind burst into the rath of one rout, and the sheehogues were in it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='131'>It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath with it, but he came to himself on the spot, and put an ear on himself, listening to what they would say.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='132'>Scarcely had they gathered into the rath till they all began shouting, and screaming, and talking amongst themselves; and then each one of them cried out: "My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!" and Guleesh took courage, and called out as loudly as any of them: "My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!" But before the word was well out of his mouth, another man cried out: "Ora! Guleesh, my boy, are you here with us again? How are you getting on with your woman? There"s no use in your calling for your horse to-night. I"ll go bail you won"t play such a trick on us again. It was a good trick you played on us last year?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='145'>He drew out his knife, cut the plant, and carried it into his own house; stripped the leaves off it and cut up the stalk; and there came a thick, white juice out of it, as there comes out of the sow-thistle when it is bruised, except that the juice was more like oil.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='146'>He put it in a little pot and a little water in it, and laid it on the fire until the water was boiling, and then he took a cup, filled it half up with the juice, and put it to his own mouth.

The noise stopped; but as Tom looked sharply through the bushes, what should he see in a nook of the hedge but a brown pitcher, that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor; and by-and-by a little wee teeny tiny bit of an old man, with a little _motty_ of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head, a deeshy daushy leather apron hanging before him, pulled out a little wooden stool, and stood up upon it, and dipped a little piggin into the pitcher, and took out the full of it, and put it beside the stool, and then sat down under the pitcher, and began to work at putting a heel-piece on a bit of a brogue just fit for himself. "Well, by the powers," said Tom to himself, "I often heard tell of the Lepracauns, and, to tell God"s truth, I never rightly believed in them--but here"s one of them in real earnest.

Tell me any case in which you were as hard as this, and if you tell that, you shall get the soul of your youngest son."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='242'>"I will tell a case as hard in which I was," said Conall. "I was once a young lad, and my father had much land, and he had parks of year-old cows, and one of them had just calved, and my father told me to bring her home. I found the cow, and took her with us. There fell a shower of snow. We went into the herd"s bothy, and we took the cow and the calf in with us, and we were letting the shower pass from us. Who should come in but one cat and ten, and one great one-eyed fox-coloured cat as head bard over them. When they came in, in very deed I myself had no liking for their company. "Strike up with you," said the head bard, "why should we be still? and sing a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw." I was amazed that my name was known to the cats themselves. When they had sung the cronan, said the head bard, "Now, O Conall, pay the reward of the cronan that the cats have sung to thee." "Well then," said I myself, "I have no reward whatsoever for you, unless you should go down and take that calf." No sooner said I the word than the two cats and ten went down to attack the calf, and in very deed, he did not last them long. "Play up with you, why should you be silent? Make a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw," said the head bard. Certainly I had no liking at all for the cronan, but up came the one cat and ten, and if they did not sing me a cronan then and there! "Pay them now their reward," said the great fox-coloured cat. "I am tired myself of yourselves and your rewards," said I. "I have no reward for you unless you take that cow down there." They betook themselves to the cow, and indeed she did not last them long.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='243'>""Why will you be silent? Go up and sing a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw," said the head bard. And surely, oh king, I had no care for them or for their cronan, for I began to see that they were not good comrades. When they had sung me the cronan they betook themselves down where the head bard was. "Pay now their reward, said the head bard; and for sure, oh king, I had no reward for them; and I said to them, "I have no reward for you." And surely, oh king, there was catterwauling between them. So I leapt out at a turf window that was at the back of the house. I took myself off as hard as I might into the wood. I was swift enough and strong at that time; and when I felt the rustling toirm of the cats after me I climbed into as high a tree as I saw in the place, and one that was close in the top; and I hid myself as well as I might. The cats began to search for me through the wood, and they could not find me; and when they were tired, each one said to the other that they would turn back. "But," said the one-eyed fox-coloured cat that was commander-in-chief over them, "you saw him not with your two eyes, and though I have but one eye, there"s the rascal up in the tree." When he had said that, one of them went up in the tree, and as he was coming where I was, I drew a weapon that I had and I killed him. "Be this from me!" said the one-eyed one--"I must not be losing my company thus; gather round the root of the tree and dig about it, and let down that villain to earth." On this they gathered about <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shout;root' adjectives='' verbs='be;cut;give;dig;gather;shiver;branch;fall;wonder' valence='5.66473684211' arousal='4.23578947368' dominance='5.31526315789'>the tree</entity>, and they dug about the root, and the first branching root that they cut, she gave a shiver to fall, and I myself gave a shout, and it was not to be wondered at.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='244'>"There was in the neighbourhood of the wood a priest, and he had ten men with him delving, and he said, "There is a shout of a man in extremity and I must not be without replying to it." And the wisest of the men said, "Let it alone till we hear it again." The cats began again digging wildly, and they broke the next root; and I myself gave the next shout, and in very deed it was not a weak one. "Certainly," said the priest, "it is a man in extremity--let us move." They set themselves in order for moving. And the cats arose on the tree, and they broke the third root, and the tree fell on her elbow. Then I gave the third shout. The stalwart men hastened, and when they saw how the cats served the tree, they began at them with the spades; and they themselves and the cats began at each other, till the cats ran away. And surely, oh king, I did not move till I saw the last one of them off. And then I came home. And there"s the hardest case in which I ever was; and it seems to me that tearing by the cats were harder than hanging to-morrow by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='case;lochlann;to-morrow;cat' adjectives='hardest;harder' verbs='tear;be;s;hang;seem' valence='5.19818181818' arousal='4.35' dominance='5.26727272727'>the king</entity> of Lochlann."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='245'>"Och! Conall," said the king, "you are full of words. You have freed the soul of your son with your tale; and if you tell me a harder case than that you will get your second youngest son, and then you will have two sons."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='248'>"I was then," said Conall, "quite a young lad, and I went out hunting, and my father"s land was beside the sea, and it was rough with rocks, caves, and rifts. When I was going on the top of the shore, I saw as if there were a smoke coming up between two rocks, and I began to look what might be the meaning of the smoke coming up there. When I was looking, what should I do but fall; and the place was so full of heather, that neither bone nor skin was broken. I knew not how I should get out of this. I was not looking before me, but I kept looking overhead the way I came--and thinking that the day would never come that I could get up there. It was terrible for me to be there till I should die. I heard a great clattering coming, and what was there but a great giant and two dozen of goats with him, and a buck at their head. And when the giant had tied the goats, he came up and he said to me, "Hao O! Conall, it"s long since my knife has been rusting in my pouch waiting for thy tender flesh." "Och!" said I, "it"s not much you will be bettered by me, though you should tear me asunder; I will make but one meal for you. But I see that you are one-eyed. I am a good leech, and I will give you the sight of the other eye." The giant went and he drew the great caldron on the site of the fire. I myself was telling him how he should heat the water, so that I should give its sight to the other eye. I got heather and I made a rubber of it, and I set him upright in the caldron. I began at the eye that was well, pretending to him that I would give its sight to the other one, till I left them as bad as each other; and surely it was easier to spoil the one that was well than to give sight to the other.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='249'>"When he saw that he could not see a glimpse, and when I myself said to him that I would get out in spite of him, he gave a spring out of the water, and he stood in the mouth of the cave, and he said that he would have revenge for the sight of his eye. I had but to stay there crouched the length of the night, holding in my breath in such a way that he might not find out where I was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='250'>"When he felt the birds calling in the morning, and knew that the day was, he said--"Art thou sleeping? Awake and let out my lot of goats." I killed the buck. He cried, "I do believe that thou art killing my buck."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='251'>""I am not," said I, "but the ropes are so tight that I take long to loose them." I let out one of the goats, and there he was caressing her, and he said to her, "There thou art thou shaggy, hairy white goat; and thou seest me, but I see thee not." I kept letting them out by the way of one and one, as I flayed the buck, and before the last one was out I had him flayed bag-wise. Then I went and I put my legs in place of his legs, and my hands in place of his forelegs, and my head in place of his head, and the horns on top of my head, so that the brute might think that it was the buck. I went out. When I was going out the giant laid his hand on me, and he said, "There thou art, thou pretty buck; thou seest me, but I see thee not." When I myself got out, and I saw the world about me, surely, oh, king! joy was on me. When I was out and had shaken the skin off me, I said to the brute, "I am out now in spite of you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='252'>""Aha!" said he, "hast thou done this to me. Since thou wert so stalwart that thou hast got out, I will give thee a ring that I have here; keep the ring, and it will do thee good."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='253'>""I will not take the ring from you," said I, "but throw it, and I will take it with me." He threw the ring on the flat ground, I went myself and I lifted the ring, and I put it on my finger. When he said me then, "Is the ring fitting thee?" I said to him, "It is." Then he said, "Where art thou, ring?" And the ring said, "I am here." The brute went and went towards where the ring was speaking, and now I saw that I was in a harder case than ever I was. I drew a dirk. I cut the finger from off me, and I threw it from me as far as I could out on the loch, and there was a great depth in the place. He shouted, "Where art thou, ring?" And the ring said, "I am here," though it was on the bed of ocean. He gave a spring after the ring, and out he went in the sea. And I was as pleased then when I saw him drowning, as though you should grant my own life and the life of my two sons with me, and not lay any more trouble on me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='254'>"When the giant was drowned I went in, and I took with me all he had of gold and silver, and I went home, and surely great joy was on my people when I arrived. And as a sign now look, the finger is off me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='255'>"Yes, indeed, Conall, you are wordy and wise," said the king. "I see the finger is off you.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='256'>"Then went my father," said Conall, "and he got me a wife, and I was married. I went to hunt. I was going beside the sea, and I saw an island over in the midst of the loch, and I came there where a boat was with a rope before her, and a rope behind her, and many precious things within her. I looked myself on the boat to see how I might get part of them. I put in the one foot, and the other foot was on the ground, and when I raised my head what was it but the boat over in the middle of the loch, and she never stopped till she reached the island. When I went out of the boat the boat returned where she was before. I did not know now what I should do. The place was without meat or clothing, without the appearance of a house on it. I came out on the top of a hill. Then I came to a glen; I saw in it, at the bottom of a hollow, a woman with a child, and the child was naked on her knee, and she had a knife in her hand. She tried to put the knife to the throat of the babe, and the babe began to laugh in her face, and she began to cry, and she threw the knife behind her. I thought to myself that I was near my foe and far from my friends, and I called to the woman, "What are you doing here?" And she said to me, "What brought you here?" I told her myself word upon word how I came. "Well then," said she, "it was so I came also." She showed me to the place where I should come in where she was. I went in, and I said to her, "What was the matter that you were putting the knife on the neck of the child?" "It is that he must be cooked for the giant who is here, or else no more of my world will be before me." Just then we could be hearing the footsteps of the giant, "What shall I do? what shall I do?" cried the woman. I went to the caldron, and by luck it was not hot, so in it I got just as the brute came in. "Hast thou boiled that youngster for me?" he cried. "He"s not done yet," said she, and I cried out from the caldron, "Mammy, mammy, it"s boiling I am." Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hai;caldron;wood;haw' adjectives='' verbs='heap;laugh' valence='5.504' arousal='4.472' dominance='6.108'>the giant</entity> laughed out HAI, HAW, <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hai;caldron;wood;haw' adjectives='' verbs='heap;laugh' valence='5.504' arousal='4.472' dominance='6.108'>HOGARAICH</entity>, and heaped on wood under the caldron.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='257'>"And now I was sure I would scald before I could get out of that. As fortune favoured me, the brute slept beside the caldron. There I was scalded by the bottom of the caldron. When she perceived that he was asleep, she set her mouth quietly to the hole that was in the lid, and she said to me "was I alive?" I said I was. I put up my head, and the hole in the lid was so large, that my head went through easily. Everything was coming easily with me till I began to bring up my hips. I left the skin of my hips behind me, but I came out. When I got out of the caldron I knew not what to do; and she said to me that there was no weapon that would kill him but his own weapon. I began to draw his spear and every breath that he drew I thought I would be down his throat, and when his breath came out I was back again just as far. But with every ill that befell me I got the spear loosed from him. Then I was as one under a bundle of straw in a great wind for I could not manage the spear. And it was fearful to look on the brute, who had but one eye in the midst of his face; and it was not agreeable for the like of me to attack him. I drew the dart as best I could, and I set it in his eye. When he felt this he gave his head a lift, and he struck the other end of the dart on the top of the cave, and it went through to the back of his head. And he fell cold dead where he was; and you may be sure, oh king, that joy was on me. I myself and the woman went out on clear ground, and we passed the night there. I went and got the boat with which I came, and she was no way lightened, and took <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;land;way;boat;child' adjectives='dry' verbs='be;return;get;lighten;take;go;come' valence='5.98352941176' arousal='4.01117647059' dominance='5.52235294118'>the woman</entity> and the child over on dry land; and I returned home."</paragraph>

Shaking the bright drops from their hair and gliding to the shore, they wandered about amongst his flock. They had more than mortal beauty, and he was filled with love for her that came nearest to him.

When the time came the shepherd knew his love by the strap of her sandal.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='379'>A sprightly tailor was employed by the great Macdonald, in his castle at Saddell, in order to make the laird a pair of trews, used in olden time. And trews being the vest and breeches united in one piece, and ornamented with fringes, were very comfortable, and suitable to be worn in walking or dancing. And Macdonald had said to the tailor, that if he would make the trews by night in the church, he would get a handsome reward. For it was thought that the old ruined church was haunted, and that fearsome things were to be seen there at night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>The tailor was well aware of this; but he was a sprightly man, and when the laird dared him to make the trews by night in the church, the tailor was not to be daunted, but took it in hand to gain the prize. So, when night came, away he went up the glen, about half a mile distance from the castle, till he came to the old church. Then he chose him a nice gravestone for a seat and he lighted his candle, and put on his thimble, and set to work at the trews; plying his needle nimbly, and thinking about the hire that the laird would have to give him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='381'>For some time he got on pretty well, until he felt the floor all of a tremble under his feet; and looking about him, but keeping his fingers at work, he saw the appearance of a great human head rising up through the stone pavement of the church. And when the head had risen above the surface, there came from it a great, great voice. And the voice said: "Do you see this great head of mine?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='382'>"I see that, but I"ll sew this!" replied the sprightly tailor; and he stitched away at the trews.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='383'>Then the head rose higher up through the pavement, until its neck appeared. And when its neck was shown, the thundering voice came again and said: "Do you see this great neck of mine?"</paragraph>

But before it could pull it out of the pavement, the sprightly tailor had finished his task; and, blowing out his candle, and springing from off his gravestone, he buckled up, and ran out of the church with the trews under his arm. Then the fearsome thing gave a loud roar, and stamped with both his feet upon the pavement, and out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='roar;thing;pavement;tailor;foot' adjectives='sprightly;loud;fearsome' verbs='stamp;go;give' valence='5.43363636364' arousal='4.14181818182' dominance='5.40363636364'>the church</entity> he went after the sprightly tailor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='391'>Down the glen they ran, faster than the stream when the flood rides it; but the tailor had got the start and a nimble pair of legs, and he did not choose to lose the laird"s reward. And though the thing roared to him to stop, yet the sprightly tailor was not the man to be beholden to a monster. So he held his trews tight, and let no darkness grow under his feet, until he had reached Saddell Castle. He had no sooner got inside the gate, and shut it, than the apparition came up to it; and, enraged at losing his prize, struck the wall above the gate, and left there the mark of his five great fingers.

There was not a blade of grass growing from root, nor a bird singing in the wood, nor a star shining from heaven but Deirdre had a name for it. But one thing, she did not wish her to have either part or parley with any single living man of the rest of the world. But on a gloomy winter night, with black, scowling clouds, a hunter of game was wearily travelling the hills, and what happened but that he missed the trail of the hunt, and lost his course and companions. A drowsiness came upon the man as he wearily wandered over the hills, and he lay down by the side of the beautiful green knoll in which Deirdre lived, and he slept. The man was faint from hunger and wandering, and benumbed with cold, and a deep sleep fell upon him. When he lay down beside the green hill where Deirdre was, a troubled dream came to the man, and he thought that he enjoyed the warmth of a fairy broch, the fairies being inside playing music. The hunter shouted out in his dream, if there was any one in the broch, to let him in for the Holy One"s sake. Deirdre heard the voice and said to her foster-mother: "O foster-mother, what cry is that?" "It is nothing at all, Deirdre--merely the birds of the air astray and seeking each other. But let them go past to the bosky glade. There is no shelter or house for them here." "Oh, foster-mother, the bird asked to get inside for the sake of the God of the Elements, and you yourself tell me that anything that is asked in His name we ought to do. If you will not allow the bird that is being benumbed with cold, and done to death with hunger, to be let in, I do not think much of your language or your faith. But since I give credence to your language and to your faith, which you taught me, I will myself let in the bird." And Deirdre arose and drew the bolt from the leaf of the door, and she let in the hunter. She placed a seat in the place for sitting, food in the place for eating, and drink in the place for drinking for the man who came to the house. "Oh, for this life and raiment, you man that came in, keep restraint on your tongue!" said the old woman.

When the men neared them, Deirdre remembered the language of the huntsman, and she said to herself that these were the three sons of Uisnech, and that this was Naois, he having what was above the bend of the two shoulders above the men of Erin all. The three brothers went past without taking any notice of them, without even glancing at the young girls on the hillock. What happened but that love for Naois struck the heart of Deirdre, so that she could not but follow after him. She girded up her raiment and went after the men that went past the base of the knoll, leaving her women attendants there. Allen and Arden had heard of the woman that Connachar, King of Ulster, had with him, and they thought that, if Naois, their brother, saw her, he would have her himself, more especially as she was not married to the King. They perceived the woman coming, and called on one another to hasten their step as they had a long distance to travel, and the dusk of night was coming on. They did so. She cried: "Naois, son of Uisnech, will you leave me?" "What piercing, shrill cry is that--the most melodious my ear ever heard, and the shrillest that ever struck my heart of all the cries I ever heard?" "It is anything else but the wail of the wave-swans of Connachar," said his brothers. "No! yonder is a woman"s cry of distress," said Naois, and he swore he would not go further until he saw from whom the cry came, and Naois turned back.

Many indeed were the stories he knew, so that he had already reached a good old age without failing even for a single night in his task; and such was the skill he displayed that whatever cares of state or other annoyances might prey upon the monarch"s mind, his story-teller was sure to send him to sleep.</paragraph>

"What reward would you give me for sending plenty of fish to you?" "Ach!" said the old man, "I have not much to spare." "Will you give me the first son you have?" said she. "I would give ye that, were I to have a son," said he. "Then go home, and remember me when your son is twenty years of age, and you yourself will get plenty of fish after this." Everything happened as the sea-maiden said, and he himself got plenty of fish; but when the end of the twenty years was nearing, the old man was growing more and more sorrowful and heavy hearted, while he counted each day as it came.</paragraph>

"Let not that put you in any trouble," said the son; "I will not oppose you." "You shall not; you shall not go, my son, though I never get fish any more." "If you will not let me go with you, go to the smithy, and let the smith make me a great strong sword, and I will go seek my fortune."</paragraph>

Back went the old man to the smithy; and the smith made a great sword, its like he never made before. "There"s thy sword for thee," said the smith, "and the fist must be good that plays this blade." The old man gave the sword to his son; he gave it a shake or two. "This will do," said he; "it"s high time now to travel on my way."</paragraph>

So they asked him to divide it for them. He came down off the horse, and he divided the carcass amongst the three. Three shares to the dog, two shares to the otter, and a share to the falcon. "For this," said the dog, "if swiftness of foot or sharpness of tooth will give thee aid, mind me, and I will be at thy side." Said the otter, "If the swimming of foot on the ground of a pool will loose thee, mind me, and I will be at thy side."

The king"s daughter was now mournful, tearful, blind-sorrowful for her married man; she was always with her eye on the loch.

No sooner spoke he the word than the grateful dog was at his side; and after the hind he went, and they were not long in bringing her to earth. But he no sooner caught her than a hoodie sprang out of her. "Would that the falcon grey, of sharpest eye and swiftest wing, were here!"

Well, it so happened that Fin and his men were all working at the Causeway, in order to make a bridge across to Scotland; when Fin, who was very fond of his wife Oonagh, took it into his head that he would go home and see how the poor woman got on in his absence. So, accordingly, he pulled up a fir-tree, and, after lopping off the roots and branches, made a walking-stick of it, and set out on his way to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='root;fir-tree;way;branch;walking-stick' adjectives='' verbs='pull;lop;set;make' valence='5.34444444444' arousal='3.84555555556' dominance='5.43333333333'>Oonagh</entity>.</paragraph>

No other giant of the day could stand before him; and such was his strength, that, when well vexed, he could give a stamp that shook the country about him. The fame and name of him went far and near; and nothing in the shape of a man, it was said, had any chance with him in a fight. By one blow of his fists he flattened a thunderbolt and kept it in his pocket, in the shape of a pancake, to show to all his enemies, when they were about to fight him. Undoubtedly he had given every giant in Ireland a considerable beating, barring Fin M"Coul himself; and he swore that he would never rest, night or day, winter or summer, till he would serve Fin with the same sauce, if he could catch him. However, the short and long of it was, with reverence be it spoken, that Fin heard Cucullin was coming to the Causeway to have a trial of strength with him; and he was seized with a very warm and sudden fit of affection for his wife, poor woman, leading a very lonely, uncomfortable life of it in his absence.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1004'>"Oonagh," said he, "can you do nothing for me? Where"s all your invention? Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes, and to have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and me the best man among them?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1005'>"Be easy, Fin," replied Oonagh; "troth, I"m ashamed of you. Keep your toe in your pump, will you?

Leave him to me, and do just as I bid you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1006'>This relieved Fin very much; for, after all, he had great confidence in his wife, knowing, as he did, that she had got him out of many a quandary before. Oonagh then drew the nine woollen threads of different colours, which she always did to find out the best way of succeeding in anything of importance she went about. She then platted them into three plats with three colours in each, putting one on her right arm, one round her heart, and the third round her right ankle, for then she knew that nothing could fail with her that she undertook.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1007'>Having everything now prepared, she sent round to the neighbours and borrowed one-and-twenty iron griddles, which she took and kneaded into the hearts of one-and-twenty cakes of bread, and these she baked on the fire in the usual way, setting them aside in the cupboard according as they were done. She then put down a large pot of new milk, which she made into curds and whey. Having done all this, she sat down quite contented, waiting for his arrival on the next day about two o"clock, that being the hour at which he was expected--for Fin knew as much by the sucking of his thumb. Now this was a curious property that Fin"s thumb had.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1521'>It may be as well to give the reader some account of the enormous extent of the Celtic folk-tales in existence. I reckon these to extend to 2000, though only about 250 are in print. The former number exceeds that known in France, Italy, Germany, and Russia, where collection has been most active, and is only exceeded by the MS. collection of Finnish folk-tales at Helsingfors, said to exceed 12,000. As will be seen, this superiority of the Celts is due to the phenomenal and patriotic activity of one man, the late J. F. Campbell, of Islay, whose _Popular Tales_ and MS. collections (partly described by Mr. Alfred Nutt in _Folk-Lore_, i. 369-83) contain references to no less than 1281 tales (many of them, of course, variants and scraps). Celtic folk-tales, while more numerous, are also the oldest of the tales of modern European races; some of them--_e.g._, "Connla," in the present selection, occurring in the oldest Irish vellums. They include (1) fairy tales properly so-called--_i.e._, tales or anecdotes _about_ fairies, hobgoblins, &amp;c., told as natural occurrences; (2) hero-tales, stories of adventure told of national or mythical heroes; (3) folk-tales proper, describing marvellous adventures of otherwise unknown heroes, in which there is a defined plot and supernatural characters (speaking animals, giants, dwarfs, &amp;c.); and finally (4) drolls, comic anecdotes of feats of stupidity or cunning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1522'>But beside these more modern collections there exist in old and middle Irish a large number of hero-tales (class 2) which formed the staple of the old _ollahms_ or bards. Of these tales of "cattle-liftings, elopements, battles, voyages, courtships, caves, lakes, feasts, sieges, and eruptions," a bard of even the fourth class had to know seven fifties, presumably one for each day of the year. Sir William Temple knew of a north-country gentleman of Ireland who was sent to sleep every evening with a fresh tale from his bard. The _Book of Leinster_, an Irish vellum of the twelfth century, contains a list of 189 of these hero-tales, many of which are extant to this day; E. O"Curry gives the list in the Appendix to his MS. _Materials of Irish History_. Another list of about 70 is given in the preface to the third volume of the Ossianic Society"s publications.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1523'>Turning to SCOTLAND, we must put aside Chambers" _Popular Rhymes of Scotland_, 1842, which contains for the most part folk-tales common with those of England rather than those peculiar to the Gaelic-speaking Scots. The first name here in time as in importance is that of J. F. Campbell, of Islay. His four volumes, _Popular Tales of the West Highlands_ (Edinburgh, 1860-2, recently republished by the Islay Association), contain some 120 folk- and hero-tales, told with strict adherence to the language of the narrators, which is given with a literal, a rather too literal, English version. This careful accuracy has given an un-English air to his versions, and has prevented them attaining their due popularity. What Campbell has published represents only a tithe of what he collected. At the end of the fourth volume he gives a list of 791 tales, &amp;c., collected by him or his assistants in the two years 1859-61; and in his MS. collections at Edinburgh are two other lists containing 400 more tales. Only a portion of these are in the Advocates" Library; the rest, if extant, must be in private hands, though they are distinctly of national importance and interest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1524'>Campbell"s influence has been effective of recent years in Scotland. The _Celtic Magazine_ (vols. xii. and xiii.), while under the editorship of Mr. MacBain, contained several folk- and hero-tales in Gaelic, and so did the _Scotch Celtic Review_. These were from the collections of Messrs. Campbell of Tiree, Carmichael, and K. Mackenzie. Recently Lord Archibald Campbell has shown laudable interest in the preservation of Gaelic folk- and hero-tales. Under his auspices a whole series of handsome volumes, under the general title of _Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition_, has been recently published, four volumes having already appeared, each accompanied by notes by Mr. Alfred Nutt, which form the most important aid to the study of Celtic Folk-Tales since Campbell himself. Those to the second volume in particular (Tales collected by Rev. D. MacInnes) fill 100 pages, with condensed information on all aspects of the subject dealt with in the light of the most recent research in the European folk-tales as well as on Celtic literature.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1525'>WALES makes a poor show beside Ireland and Scotland. Sikes" _British Goblins_, and the tales collected by Prof. Rhys in _Y Cymrodor_, vols. ii.-vi., are mainly of our first-class fairy anecdotes. Borrow, in his _Wild Wales_, refers to a collection of fables in a journal called _The Greal_, while the _Cambrian Quarterly Magazine_ for 1830 and 1831 contained a few fairy anecdotes, including a curious version of the "Brewery of Eggshells" from the Welsh. In the older literature, the _Iolo MS._, published by the Welsh MS. Society, has a few fables and apologues, and the charming _Mabinogion_, translated by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hero-tale;literature;guest;folk-tale;apologue;tale;ms.;mabinogion;fable;iolo;_' adjectives='few;border-line;charming;older' verbs='trace;be;translate;have;publish' valence='5.76388888889' arousal='3.68222222222' dominance='5.85277777778'>Lady</entity> Guest, has tales that can trace back to the twelfth century and are on the border-line between folk-tales and hero-tales.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1526'>CORNWALL and MAN are even worse than Wales. Hunt"s _Drolls from the West of England_ has nothing distinctively Celtic, and it is only by a chance Lhuyd chose a folk-tale as his specimen of Cornish in his _Archaeologia Britannica_, 1709 (see _Tale of Ivan_). The Manx folk-tales published, including the most recent by Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='folk-tale;manx;legend;mr.;anecdote;folk-lore;fairy;_' adjectives='recent' verbs='be;include;publish' valence='6.06222222222' arousal='4.04333333333' dominance='5.77111111111'>Moore</entity>, in his _Folk-Lore of the Isle of Man_, 1891, are mainly fairy anecdotes and legends.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1527'>From this survey of the field of Celtic folk-tales it is clear that Ireland and Scotland provide the lion"s share. The interesting thing to notice is the remarkable similarity of Scotch and Irish folk-tales. The continuity of language and culture between these two divisions of Gaeldom has clearly brought about this identity of their folk-tales. As will be seen from the following notes, the tales found in Scotland can almost invariably be paralleled by those found in Ireland, and _vice versa_. This result is a striking confirmation of the general truth that folk-lores of different countries resemble one another in proportion to their contiguity and to the continuity of language and culture between them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1528'>Another point of interest in these Celtic folk-tales is the light they throw upon the relation of hero-tales and folk-tales (classes 2 and 3 above). Tales told of Finn of Cuchulain, and therefore coming under the definition of hero-tales, are found elsewhere told of anonymous or unknown heroes. The question is, were the folk-tales the earliest, and were they localised and applied to the heroes, or were the heroic sagas generalised and applied to an unknown [Greek: tis]? All the evidence, in my opinion, inclines to the former view, which, as applied to Celtic folk-tales, is of very great literary importance; for it is becoming more and more recognised, thanks chiefly to the admirable work of Mr. Alfred Nutt, in his _Studies on the Holy Grail_, that the outburst of European Romance in the twelfth century was due, in large measure, to an infusion of Celtic hero-tales into the literature of the Romance-speaking nations. Now the remarkable thing is, how these hero tales have lingered on in oral tradition even to the present day. (See a marked case in "Deirdre.") We may, therefore, hope to see considerable light thrown on the most characteristic spiritual product of the Middle Ages, the literature of Romance and the spirit of chivalry, from the Celtic folk-tales of the present day. Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='literature;holy;study;method;application;mr.;grail;research;section' adjectives='further;true;probable;special;new' verbs='be;extend;show;connect;have;seem' valence='6.02090909091' arousal='3.95772727273' dominance='5.71272727273'>Alfred Nutt</entity> has already shown this to be true of a special section of Romance literature, that connected with the Holy Grail, and it seems probable that further study will extend <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='literature;holy;study;method;application;mr.;grail;research;section' adjectives='further;true;probable;special;new' verbs='be;extend;show;connect;have;seem' valence='6.02090909091' arousal='3.95772727273' dominance='5.71272727273'>the field</entity> of application of this new method of research.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1529'>The Celtic folk-tale again has interest in retaining many traits of primitive conditions among the early inhabitants of these isles which are preserved by no other record. Take, for instance, the calm assumption of polygamy in "Gold Tree and Silver Tree." That represents a state of feeling that is decidedly pre-Christian. The belief in an external soul "Life Index," recently monographed by Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='index;life;note;belief;fair;sea-maiden;couple;soul;idea;tale;mr.;expression' adjectives='many;primitive;other;external' verbs='see;tremble;find;monograph' valence='5.93157894737' arousal='4.1' dominance='5.63421052632'>Frazer</entity> in his "Golden Bough," also finds expression in a couple of the Tales (see notes on "Sea-Maiden" and "Fair, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='index;life;note;belief;fair;sea-maiden;couple;soul;idea;tale;mr.;expression' adjectives='many;primitive;other;external' verbs='see;tremble;find;monograph' valence='5.93157894737' arousal='4.1' dominance='5.63421052632'>Brown</entity>, and Trembling"), and so with many other primitive ideas.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1530'>Care, however, has to be taken in using folk-tales as evidence for primitive practice among the nations where they are found. For the tales may have come from another race--that is, for example, probably the case with "Gold Tree and Silver Tree" (see Notes). Celtic tales are of peculiar interest in this connection, as they afford one of the best fields for studying the problem of diffusion, the most pressing of the problems of the folk-tales just at present, at least in my opinion. The Celts are at the furthermost end of Europe. Tales that travelled to them could go no further and must therefore be the last links in the chain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1531'>For all these reasons, then, Celtic folk-tales are of high scientific interest to the folk-lorist, while they yield to none in imaginative and literary qualities. In any other country of Europe some national means of recording them would have long ago been adopted. M. Luzel, _e.g._, was commissioned by the French Minister of Public Instruction to collect and report on the Breton folk-tales. England, here as elsewhere without any organised means of scientific research in the historical and philological sciences, has to depend on the enthusiasm of a few private individuals for work of national importance. Every Celt of these islands or in the Gaeldom beyond <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='duty;heart;celt;island;nation;member;record;race;memory;tradition;gaeldom' adjectives='humbler' verbs='be;regard;live;remain;cease;put' valence='5.977' arousal='3.8855' dominance='5.6505'>the sea</entity>, and every Celt-lover among the English-speaking nations, should regard it as one of the duties of the race to put its traditions on record in the few years that now remain before they will cease for ever to be living in the hearts and memories of the humbler members of the race.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1532'>In the following Notes I have done as in my _English Fairy Tales_, and given first, the _sources_ whence I drew the tales, then _parallels_ at length for the British Isles, with bibliographical references for parallels abroad, and finally, _remarks_ where the tales seemed to need them. In these I have not wearied or worried the reader with conventional tall talk about the Celtic genius and its manifestations in the folk-tale; on that topic one can only repeat Matthew Arnold when at his best, in his _Celtic Literature_. Nor have I attempted to deal with the more general aspects of the study of the Celtic folk-tale. For these I must refer to Mr. Nutt"s series of papers in _The Celtic Magazine_, vol. xii., or, still better, to the masterly introductions he is contributing to the series of _Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition_, and to Dr. Hyde"s _Beside the Fireside_. In my remarks I have mainly confined myself to discussing the origin and diffusion of the various tales, so far as anything definite could be learnt or conjectured on that subject.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1533'>Before proceeding to the Notes, I may "put in," as the lawyers say, a few summaries of the results reached in them. Of the twenty-six tales, twelve (i., ii., v., viii., ix., x., xi., xv., xvi., xvii., xix., xxiv.) have Gaelic originals; three (vii., xiii., xxv.) are from the Welsh; one (xxii.) from the now extinct Cornish; one an adaptation of an English poem founded on a Welsh tradition (xxi., "Gellert"); and the remaining nine are what may be termed Anglo-Irish. Regarding their diffusion among the Celts, twelve are both Irish and Scotch (iv., v., vi., ix., x., xiv.-xvii., xix., xx., xxiv); one (xxv.) is common to Irish and Welsh; and one (xxii.) to Irish and Cornish; seven are found only among the Celts in Ireland (i.-iii., xii., xviii., xxii., xxvi); two (viii., xi.) among the Scotch; and three (vii., xiii., xxi.) among the Welsh. Finally, so far as we can ascertain their origin, four (v., xvi., xxi., xxii.) are from the East; five (vi., x., xiv., xx., xxv.) are European drolls; three of the romantic tales seem to have been imported (vii., ix., xix.); while three others are possibly Celtic exportations to the Continent (xv., xvii., xxiv.) though the, last may have previously come thence; the remaining eleven are, as far as known, original to Celtic lands. Somewhat the same result would come out, I believe, as the analysis of any representative collection of folk-tales of any <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='collection;district;folk-tale;result;analysis' adjectives='representative;same' verbs='believe;come' valence='5.56444444444' arousal='3.91777777778' dominance='5.74666666667'>European</entity> district.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1537'>_Remarks_.--Conn the hundred-fighter had the head-kingship of Ireland 123-157 A.D., according to the _Annals of the Four Masters_, i. 105. On the day of his birth the five great roads from Tara to all parts of Ireland were completed: one of them from Dublin is still used. Connaught is said to have been named after him, but this is scarcely consonant with Joyce"s identification with Ptolemy"s _Nagnatai_ (_Irish Local Names_, i. 75). But there can be little doubt of Conn"s existence as a powerful ruler in Ireland in the second century. The historic existence of Connla seems also to be authenticated by the reference to him as Conly, the eldest son of Conn, in the Annals of Clonmacnoise. As Conn was succeeded by his third son, Art Enear, Connla was either slain or disappeared during his father"s lifetime. Under these circumstances it is not unlikely that our legend grew up within the century after <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='legend;circumstance' adjectives='unlikely' verbs='be;grow' valence='5.515' arousal='3.53125' dominance='5.35'>Conn</entity>--_i.e._, during the latter half of the second century.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1538'>As regards the present form of it, Prof. Zimmer (_l.c._ 261-2) places it in the seventh century. It has clearly been touched up by a Christian hand who introduced the reference to the day of judgment and to the waning power of the Druids. But nothing turns upon this interpolation, so that it is likely that even the present form of the legend is pre-Christian-_i.e._ for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;legend;form;interpolation' adjectives='likely' verbs='turn;be' valence='6.1775' arousal='3.96875' dominance='5.95'>Ireland</entity>, pre-Patrician, before the fifth century.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1539'>The tale of Connla is thus the earliest fairy tale of modern Europe. Besides this interest it contains an early account of one of the most characteristic Celtic conceptions, that of the earthly Paradise, the Isle of Youth, _Tir-nan-Og_. This has impressed itself on the European imagination; in the Arthuriad it is represented by the Vale of Avalon, and as represented in the various Celtic visions of the future life, it forms one of the main sources of Dante"s _Divina Commedia_. It is possible too, I think, that the Homeric Hesperides and the Fortunate Isles of the ancients had a Celtic origin (as is well known, the early place-names of Europe are predominantly Celtic). I have found, I believe, a reference to the conception in one of the earliest passages in the classics dealing with the Druids. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='term;reverence;_;i.' adjectives='high' verbs='address' valence='5.89' arousal='3.5' dominance='5.3075'>Lucan</entity>, in his _<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='term;reverence;_;i.' adjectives='high' verbs='address' valence='5.89' arousal='3.5' dominance='5.3075'>Pharsalia</entity>_ (i. 450-8), addresses them in these high terms of reverence:</paragraph>

Ossian had gone away to Tir-nan-Og with the fairy Niamh under very much the same circumstances as Condla Ruad; time flies in the land of eternal youth, and when Ossian returns, after a year as he thinks, more than three centuries had passed, and St. Patrick had just succeeded in introducing the new faith.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1559'>_Parallels_.--Campbell"s vi. and vii. are two variants showing how widespread the story is in Gaelic Scotland. It occurs in Ireland where it has been printed in the chapbook, _Hibernian Tales_, as the "Black Thief and the Knight of the Glen," the Black Thief being Conall, and the knight corresponding to the King of Lochlan (it is given in Mr. Lang"s _Red Fairy Book_). Here it attracted the notice of Thackeray, who gives a good abstract of it in his _Irish Sketch-Book_, ch. xvi. He thinks it "worthy of the Arabian Nights, as wild and odd as an Eastern tale." "That fantastical way of bearing testimony to the previous tale by producing an old woman who says the tale is not only true, but who was the very old woman who lived in the giant"s castle is almost" (why "almost," Mr. Thackeray?) "a stroke of genius." The incident of the giant"s breath occurs in the story of Koisha Kayn, MacInnes" _Tales_, i. 241, as well as the Polyphemus one, _ibid._ 265. One-eyed giants are frequent in Celtic folk-tales (_e.g._ in _The Pursuit of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='_;giant;pursuit;folk-tale' adjectives='one-eyed;frequent' verbs='be' valence='5.4875' arousal='4.5625' dominance='5.88'>Diarmaid</entity>_ and in the _<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='_;giant;pursuit;folk-tale' adjectives='one-eyed;frequent' verbs='be' valence='5.4875' arousal='4.5625' dominance='5.88'>Mabinogi</entity>_ of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='_;giant;pursuit;folk-tale' adjectives='one-eyed;frequent' verbs='be' valence='5.4875' arousal='4.5625' dominance='5.88'>Owen</entity>).</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1560'>_Remarks._--Thackeray"s reference to the "Arabian Nights" is especially apt, as the tale of Conall is a framework story like _The 1001 Nights_, the three stories told by Conall being framed, as it were, in a fourth which is nominally the real story. This method employed by the Indian story-tellers and from them adopted by Boccaccio and thence into all European literatures (Chaucer, Queen Margaret, &amp;c.), is generally thought to be peculiar to the East, and to be ultimately derived from the Jatakas or Birth Stories of the Buddha who tells his adventures in former incarnations. Here we find it in Celtdom, and it occurs also in "The Story-teller at Fault" in this collection, and the story of _Koisha Kayn_ in MacInnes" _Argyllshire Tales_, a variant of which, collected but not published by Campbell, has no less than nineteen tales enclosed in a framework. The question is whether the method was adopted independently in Ireland, or was due to foreign influences. Confining ourselves to "Conal Yellowclaw," it seems not unlikely that the whole story is an importation. For the second episode is clearly the story of Polyphemus from the Odyssey which was known in Ireland perhaps as early as the tenth century (see Prof. K. Meyer"s edition of _Merugud Uilix maic Leirtis_, Pref. p. xii). It also crept into the voyages of Sindbad in the _Arabian Nights_. And as told in the Highlands it bears comparison even with the Homeric version. As Mr. Nutt remarks (_Celt. Mag._ xii.) the address of the giant to the buck is as effective as that of Polyphemus to his ram. The narrator, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;story;narrator;mind;frame;ornament;pathos;address;l.c.;man' adjectives='blind' verbs='feel;be;say;come;hang' valence='5.79722222222' arousal='3.88111111111' dominance='5.43222222222'>James Wilson</entity>, was a blind man who would naturally feel the pathos of the address; "it comes from the heart of the narrator;" says Campbell (_l.c._, 148), "it is the ornament which his mind hangs on the frame of the story."</paragraph>

Dr. Hyde has an Irish version of Campbell"s tale written down in 1762, from which he gives the incident of the air-ladder (which I have had to euphemise in my version) in his _Beside the Fireside_, p. 191, and other passages in his Preface. The most remarkable parallel to this incident, however, is afforded by the feats of Indian jugglers reported briefly by Marco Polo, and illustrated with his usual wealth of learning by the late Sir Henry Yule, in his edition, vol. i. p. 308 _seq._ The accompanying illustration (reduced from Yule) will tell its own tale: it is taken from the Dutch account of the travels of an English sailor, E. Melton, _Zeldzaame Reizen_, 1702, p. 468. It tells the tale in five acts, all included in one sketch. Another instance quoted by Yule is still more parallel, so to speak. The twenty-third trick performed by some conjurors before the Emperor Jahangueir (_Memoirs_, p. 102) is thus described: "They produced a chain of 50 cubits in length, and in my presence threw one end of it towards the sky, where it remained as if fastened to something in the air. A dog was then brought forward, and being placed at the lower end of the chain, immediately ran up, and, reaching the other end, immediately disappeared in the air. In the same manner a hog, a panther, a lion, and a tiger were successively sent up the chain." It has been suggested that the conjurors hypnotise the spectators, and make them believe they see these things. This is practically the suggestion of a wise Mohammedan, who is quoted by Yule as saying, "_Wallah!_ "tis my opinion there has been neither going up nor coming down; "tis all hocus-pocus," hocus-pocus being presumably the Mohammedan term for hypnotism.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1605'>_Remarks_.--Dr. Hyde (_l.c._ Pref. xxix.) thinks our tale cannot be older than 1362, because of a reference to one O"Connor Sligo which occurs in all its variants; it is, however, omitted in our somewhat abridged version. Mr Nutt (_ap._ Campbell, _The Fians_, Introd. xix.) thinks that this does not prevent a still earlier version having existed. I should have thought that the existence of so distinctly Eastern a trick in the tale, and the fact that it is a framework story (another Eastern characteristic), would imply that it is a rather late importation, with local allusions superadded (_cf._ notes on "Conal Yellowclaw," No v.)</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1606'>The passages in verse from pp 137, 139, and the description of the Beggarman, pp. 136, 140, are instances of a curious characteristic of Gaelic folk-tales called "runs."

The volumes of _Waifs and Strays_ contain numerous examples of these "runs," which have been indexed in each volume.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1609'>_Source_.--Campbell, _Pop. Tales_, No. 4. I have omitted the births of the animal comrades and transposed the carlin to the middle of the tale. Mr. Batten has considerately idealised the Sea-Maiden in his frontispiece. When she restores the husband to the wife in one of the variants, she brings him out of her mouth! "So the sea-maiden put up his head (_Who do you mean? Out of her mouth to be sure. She had swallowed him_)."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1610'>_Remarks_.--As both Prof. Rhys (_Hibbert Lect._, 464) and Mr. Nutt (MacInnes" _Tales_, 477) have pointed out, practically the same story (that of Perseus and Andromeda) is told of the Ultonian hero, Cuchulain, in the _Wooing of Emer_, a tale which occurs in the Book of Leinster, a MS. of the twelfth century, and was probably copied from one of the eighth. Unfortunately it is not complete, and the Sea-Maiden incident is only to be found in a British Museum MS. of about 1300. In this Cuchulain finds that the daughter of Ruad is to be given as a tribute to the Fomori, who, according to Prof. Rhys, _Folk-Lore_, ii. 293, have something of the night_mare_ about their etymology. Cuchulain fights _three_ of them successively, has his wounds bound up by a strip of the maiden"s garment, and then departs. Thereafter many boasted of having slain the Fomori, but the maiden believed them not till at last by a stratagem she recognises Cuchulain. I may add to this that in Mr. Curtin"s _Myths_, 330, the threefold trial of the sword is told of Cuchulain. This would seem to trace our story back to the seventh or eighth century and certainly to the thirteenth. If so, it is likely enough that it spread from Ireland through Europe with the Irish missions (for the wide extent of which see map in Mrs. Bryant"s _Celtic Ireland_). The very letters that have spread through all Europe except Russia, are to be traced to the script of these Irish monks: why not certain folk-tales? There is a further question whether the story was originally told of Cuchulain as a hero-tale and then became departicularised as a folk-tale, or was the process _vice versa_. Certainly in the form in which it appears in the _Tochmarc Emer_ it is not complete, so that here, as elsewhere, we seem to have an instance of a folk-tale applied to a well-known heroic name, and becoming a hero-tale or saga.</paragraph>

The two heroes could not have come together in any early form of their sagas, since Cuchulain"s reputed date is of the first, Finn"s of the third century A.D. (_cf._ however, MacDougall"s _Tales_, notes, 272). Besides, the grotesque form of the legend is enough to remove it from the region of the hero-tale. On the other hand, there is a distinct reference to Finn"s wisdom-tooth, which presaged the future to him (on this see _Revue Celtique_, v. 201, Joyce, _Old Celt. Rom._, 434-5, and MacDougall, _l.c._ 274). Cucullin"s power-finger is another instance of the life-index or external soul, on which see remarks on Sea-Maiden.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1633'>It remains only to explain why Jones connected the legend with Llewelyn. Llewelyn had local connection with Bedd Gellert, which was the seat of an Augustinian abbey, one of the oldest in Wales. An inspeximus of Edward I. given in Dugdale, _Monast. Angl._, ed. pr. ii. 100a, quotes as the earliest charter of the abbey "Cartam Lewelin, magni." The name of the abbey was "Beth Kellarth"; the name is thus given by Leland, _l.c._, and as late as 1794 an engraving at the British Museum is entitled "Beth Kelert," while Carlisle gives it as "Beth Celert." The place was thus named after the abbey, not after the cairn or rock. This is confirmed by the fact of which Prof. Rhys had informed me, that the collocation of letters _rt_ is un-Welsh. Under these circumstances it is not impossible, I think, that the earlier legend of the marvellous run of "Cylart" from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='run;name;circumstance;fancy;folk-etymology;cylart;legend' adjectives='marvellous;impossible;earlier;due;simpler' verbs='etymologise;be;think;interpret' valence='5.809375' arousal='4.284375' dominance='5.5125'>Carnarvon</entity> was due to the etymologising fancy of some English-speaking Welshman who interpreted the name as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='run;name;circumstance;fancy;folk-etymology;cylart;legend' adjectives='marvellous;impossible;earlier;due;simpler' verbs='etymologise;be;think;interpret' valence='5.809375' arousal='4.284375' dominance='5.5125'>Killhart</entity>, so that the simpler legend would be only a folk-etymology.</paragraph>

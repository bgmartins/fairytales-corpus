	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>Once upon a time in a certain country there lived a king whose palace was surrounded by a spacious garden. But, though the gardeners were many and the soil was good, this garden yielded neither flowers nor fruits, not even grass or shady trees.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='46'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='despair;man' adjectives='old;wise' verbs='be;say' valence='5.34125' arousal='4.40625' dominance='5.435'>The King</entity> was in despair about it, when a wise old man said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='47'>"Your gardeners do not understand their business: but what can you expect of men whose fathers were cobblers and carpenters? How should they have learned to cultivate your garden?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='48'>"You are quite right," cried <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='right' verbs='be;cry' valence='5.68' arousal='4.5825' dominance='5.1875'>the King</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>"Therefore," continued the old man, "you should send for a gardener whose father and grandfather have been gardeners before him, and very soon your garden will be full of green grass and gay flowers, and you will enjoy its delicious fruit."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='50'>So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='town;forefather;hamlet;messenger;dominion;village;gardener' adjectives='' verbs='be;have;look;send;find' valence='5.86823529412' arousal='3.67647058824' dominance='5.73941176471'>the King</entity> sent messengers to every town, village, and hamlet in his dominions, to look for a gardener whose forefathers had been gardeners also, and after forty days one was found.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='51'>"Come with us and be gardener to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gardener' adjectives='' verbs='be;say;come' valence='6.016' arousal='3.766' dominance='6.124'>the King</entity>," they said to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='52'>"How can I go to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wretch;gardener' adjectives='poor' verbs='go;say' valence='5.50090909091' arousal='4.43181818182' dominance='5.55818181818'>the King</entity>," said the gardener, "a poor wretch like me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='53'>"That is of no consequence," they answered. "Here are new clothes for you and your family."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='54'>"But I owe money to several people."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>"We will pay your debts," they said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='56'>So the gardener allowed himself to be persuaded, and went away with the messengers, taking his wife and his son with him; and the King, delighted to have found a real gardener, entrusted him with the care of his garden. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='flower;garden;gift;servant;difficulty;fruit;place' adjectives='new;royal;same' verbs='be;like;make;shower;produce;find' valence='6.09523809524' arousal='3.96047619048' dominance='5.83095238095'>The man</entity> found no difficulty in making the royal garden produce flowers and fruit, and at the end of a year <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='flower;garden;gift;servant;difficulty;fruit;place' adjectives='new;royal;same' verbs='be;like;make;shower;produce;find' valence='6.09523809524' arousal='3.96047619048' dominance='5.83095238095'>the park</entity> was not like the same place, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='flower;garden;gift;servant;difficulty;fruit;place' adjectives='new;royal;same' verbs='be;like;make;shower;produce;find' valence='6.09523809524' arousal='3.96047619048' dominance='5.83095238095'>the King</entity> showered gifts upon his new servant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='57'>The gardener, as you have heard already, had a son, who was a very handsome young man, with most agreeable manners, and every day he carried the best fruit of the garden to the King, and all the prettiest flowers to his daughter. Now this princess was wonderfully pretty and was just sixteen years old, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='princess;time' adjectives='' verbs='marry;be;begin;think' valence='6.216' arousal='4.014' dominance='5.474'>the King</entity> was beginning to think it was time that she should be married.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>"My dear child," said he, "you are of an age to take a husband, therefore I am thinking of marrying you to the son of my prime minister.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='60'>"Why not?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.975' arousal='3.965' dominance='5.91'>the King</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='61'>"Because I love the gardener"s son," answered the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;gardener;son' adjectives='' verbs='answer;love' valence='6.42857142857' arousal='4.59428571429' dominance='5.62571428571'>Princess</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>Then the King consulted his ministers. "This is what you must do," they said. "To get rid of the gardener you must send both suitors to a very distant country, and the one who returns first shall marry your daughter."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='64'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='copper;horse;gold;money;advice;purse;son;thought;s;journey;minister;piece;gardener' adjectives='full;old;splendid;lame' verbs='follow;come;have;present;be' valence='5.76257142857' arousal='4.11657142857' dominance='5.56342857143'>The King</entity> followed this advice, and the minister"s son was presented with a splendid horse and a purse full of gold pieces, while the gardener"s son had only an old lame horse and a purse full of copper money, and every one thought he would never come back from his journey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>The day before they started the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lover' adjectives='' verbs='start;say;meet' valence='6.74333333333' arousal='4.90666666667' dominance='5.995'>Princess</entity> met her lover and said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>"Be brave, and remember always that I love you. Take this purse full of jewels and make the best use you can of them for love of me, and come back quickly and demand my hand."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>The two suitors left the town together, but the minister"s son went off at a gallop on his good horse, and very soon was lost to sight behind the most distant hills. He traveled on for some days, and presently reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a stone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>"Good-day to you, young traveler," said she.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>But the minister"s son made no reply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>"Have pity upon me, traveler," she said again. "I am dying of hunger, as you see, and three days have I been here and no one has given me anything."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>"Let me alone, old witch," cried the young man; "I can do nothing for you," and so saying he went on his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='72'>That same evening the gardener"s son rode up to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;horse;gardener;son' adjectives='gray;same;lame' verbs='ride' valence='5.64555555556' arousal='3.71' dominance='5.23333333333'>the fountain</entity> upon his lame gray horse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>"Good-day to you, young traveler," said the beggar-woman.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='74'>"Good-day, good woman," answered he.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='75'>"Young traveler, have pity upon me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>"Take my purse, good woman," said he, "and mount behind me, for your legs can"t be very strong."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='77'>The old woman didn"t wait to be asked twice, but mounted behind him, and in this style they reached the chief city of a powerful kingdom. The minister"s son was lodged in a grand inn, the gardener"s son and the old woman dismounted at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='woman;beggar;inn;son;s;minister;gardener' adjectives='old;grand' verbs='lodge;be;dismount' valence='5.545625' arousal='3.990625' dominance='5.38625'>the inn</entity> for beggars.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='78'>The next day the gardener"s son heard a great noise in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='kind;noise;son;instrument;s;gardener' adjectives='great' verbs='herald;blow;cry;hear;pass' valence='5.74294117647' arousal='4.27294117647' dominance='5.52352941176'>the street</entity>, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kind;noise;son;instrument;s;gardener' adjectives='great' verbs='herald;blow;cry;hear;pass' valence='5.74294117647' arousal='4.27294117647' dominance='5.52352941176'>the King</entity>"s heralds passed, blowing all kinds of instruments, and crying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='79'>"The King, our master, is old and infirm. He will give a great reward to whoever will cure him and give him back the strength of his youth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>Then the old beggar-woman said to her benefactor:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>"This is what you must do to obtain the reward which the King promises. Go out of the town by the south gate, and there you will find three little dogs of different colors; the first will be white, the second black, the third red. You must kill them and then burn them separately, and gather up the ashes. Put the ashes of each dog into a bag of its own color, then go before the door of the palace and cry out, "A celebrated physician has come from Janina in Albania. He alone can cure the King and give him back the strength of his youth." The King"s physicians will say, This is an impostor, and not a learned man," and they will make all sorts of difficulties, but you will overcome them all at last, and will present yourself before the sick King. You must then demand as much wood as three mules can carry, and a great cauldron, and must shut yourself up in a room with the Sultan, and when the cauldron boils you must throw him into it, and there leave him until his flesh is completely separated from his bones. Then arrange the bones in their proper places, and throw over them the ashes out of the three bags. The King will come back to life, and will be just as he was when he was twenty years old. For your reward you must demand the bronze ring which has the power to grant you everything you desire. Go, my son, and do not forget any of my instructions."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='82'>The young man followed the old beggar-woman"s directions. On going out of the town he found the white, red, and black dogs, and killed and burnt them, gathering the ashes in three bags. Then he ran to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='cry;run' valence='5.24333333333' arousal='5.12' dominance='4.46666666667'>the palace</entity> and cried:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='83'>"A celebrated physician has just come from Janina in Albania. He alone can cure <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='youth;strength' adjectives='' verbs='cure;back;give' valence='6.2275' arousal='4.08625' dominance='5.66'>the King</entity> and give him back the strength of his youth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='84'>The King"s physicians at first laughed at the unknown wayfarer, but the Sultan ordered that the stranger should be admitted. They brought the cauldron and the loads of wood, and very soon the King was boiling away. Toward mid-day the gardener"s son arranged the bones in their places, and he had hardly scattered the ashes over them before the old <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='son;s;place;gardener;ash;bone' adjectives='mid-day;hearty;old;young' verbs='revive;find;scatter;have;arrange' valence='5.71428571429' arousal='4.03071428571' dominance='5.71714285714'>King</entity> revived, to find himself once more young and hearty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"How can I reward you, my benefactor?" he cried. "Will you take half my treasures?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>"No," said the gardener"s son.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>"My daughter"s hand?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>"_No_."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>"Take half my kingdom."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>"No. Give me only the bronze ring which can instantly grant me anything I wish for."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>"Alas!" said the King, "I set great store by that marvelous ring; nevertheless, you shall have it." And he gave it to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>The gardener"s son went back to say good-by to the old beggar-woman; then he said to the bronze ring:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>"Prepare a splendid ship in which I may continue my journey. Let the hull be of fine gold, the masts of silver, the sails of brocade; let the crew consist of twelve young men of noble appearance, dressed like kings. St. Nicholas will be at the helm. As to the cargo, let it be diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and carbuncles."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>And immediately a ship appeared upon the sea which resembled in every particular the description given by the gardener"s son, and, stepping on board, he continued his journey. Presently he arrived at a great town and established himself in a wonderful palace. After several days he met his rival, the minister"s son, who had spent all his money and was reduced to the disagreeable employment of a carrier of dust and rubbish. The gardener"s son said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>"What is your name, what is your family, and from what country do you come?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>"I am the son of the prime minister of a great nation, and yet see what a degrading occupation I am reduced to."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>"Follow me to my palace."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='100'>The minister"s son followed the rich stranger, whom he had not recognized.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='101'>"Make this ring red-hot," commanded the master, "and mark <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='master;ring;red-hot;back' adjectives='' verbs='make;command;mark' valence='5.545' arousal='4.01666666667' dominance='5.61666666667'>the man</entity> with it upon his back."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='102'>The slaves obeyed him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>"Now, young man," said the rich stranger, "I am going to give you a vessel which will take you back to your own country."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='104'>And, going out, he took the bronze ring and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>"Bronze ring, obey thy master. Prepare me a ship of which the half-rotten timbers shall be painted black, let the sails be in rags, and the sailors infirm and sickly. One shall have lost a leg, another an arm, the third shall be a hunchback, another lame or club-footed or blind, and most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars. Go, and let my orders be executed."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>The minister"s son embarked in this old vessel, and thanks to favorable winds, at length reached his own country. In spite of the pitiable condition in which he returned they received him joyfully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='107'>"I am the first to come back," said he to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='marriage;promise' adjectives='' verbs='fulfil;be;say;come;give' valence='6.2825' arousal='4.35083333333' dominance='5.72583333333'>the King</entity>; now fulfil your promise, and give me <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='marriage;promise' adjectives='' verbs='fulfil;be;say;come;give' valence='6.2825' arousal='4.35083333333' dominance='5.72583333333'>the princess</entity> in marriage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>So they at once began to prepare for the wedding festivities. As to the poor princess, she was sorrowful and angry enough about it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='110'>"What strange ship is this," he cried, "that has a golden hull, silver masts, and silken sails, and who are the young men like princes who man it?

The White Bear gave her a silver bell, and told her that when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell, and what she wanted would appear. So after she had eaten, and night was drawing near, she grew sleepy after her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed. She rang the bell, and scarcely had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready made for her, which was as pretty as anyone could wish to sleep in. It had pillows of silk, and curtains of silk fringed with gold, and everything that was in the room was of gold or silver, but when she had lain down and put out the light a man came and lay down beside her, and behold it was the White Bear, who cast off the form of a beast during the night.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='249'>So one Sunday the White Bear came and said that they could now set out to see her father and mother, and they journeyed thither, she sitting on his back, and they went a long, long way, and it took a long, long time; but at last they came to a large white farmhouse, and her brothers and sisters were running about outside it, playing, and it was so pretty that it was a pleasure to look at it.</paragraph>

But in the afternoon, after they had dined at midday, all happened just as the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber. But she remembered what the White Bear had said, and would on no account go. "What we have to say can be said at any time," she answered. But somehow or other her mother at last persuaded her, and she was forced to tell the whole story. So she told how every night a man came and lay down beside her when the lights were all put out, and how she never saw him, because he always went away before it grew light in the morning, and how she continually went about in sadness, thinking how happy she would be if she could but see him, and how all day long she had to go about alone, and it was so dull and solitary. "Oh!" cried the mother, in horror, "you are very likely sleeping with a troll! But I will teach you a way to see him. You shall have a bit of one of my candles, which you can take away with you hidden in your breast. Look at him with that when he is asleep, but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='253'>So she took the candle, and hid it in her breast, and when evening drew near the White Bear came to fetch her away. When they had gone some distance on their way, the White Bear asked her if everything had not happened just as he had foretold, and she could not but own that it had. "Then, if you have done what your mother wished," said he, "you have brought great misery on both of us." "No," she said, "I have not done anything at all." So when she had reached home and had gone to bed it was just the same as it had been before, and a man came and lay down beside her, and late at night, when she could hear that he was sleeping, she got up and kindled a light, lit her candle, let her light shine on him, and saw him, and he was the handsomest prince that eyes had ever beheld, and she loved him so much that it seemed to her that she must die if she did not kiss him that very moment. So she did kiss him; but while she was doing it she let three drops of hot tallow fall upon his shirt, and he awoke. "What have you done now?" said he; "you have brought misery on both of us. If you had but held out for the space of one year I should have been free. I have a step-mother who has bewitched me so that I am a white bear by day and a man by night; but now all is at an end between you and me, and I must leave you, and go to her. She lives in a castle which lies east of the sun and west of the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ell;sun;nose;west;castle;princess' adjectives='east' verbs='lie;live;marry;be' valence='5.9235' arousal='4.117' dominance='5.368'>moon</entity>, and there too is a princess with a nose which is three ells long, and she now is the one whom I must marry."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='254'>She wept and lamented, but all in vain, for go he must. Then she asked him if she could not go with him. But no, that could not be. "Can you tell me <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;seek;tell;allow;do' valence='5.64083333333' arousal='3.745' dominance='5.65666666667'>the way</entity> then, and I will seek you--that I may surely be allowed to do!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='255'>"Yes, you may do that," said he; "but there is no way thither. It lies east of the sun and west of the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sun;way;west' adjectives='east' verbs='lie;find' valence='5.82875' arousal='3.5825' dominance='5.36625'>moon</entity>, and never would you find your way there."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='256'>When she awoke in the morning both the Prince and the castle were gone, and she was lying on a small green patch in the midst of a dark, thick wood. By her side lay the self-same bundle of rags which she had brought with her from her own home. So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was weary, she set out on her way, and thus she walked for many and many a long day, until at last she came to a great mountain. Outside it an aged woman was sitting, playing with a golden apple. The girl asked her if she knew the way to the Prince who lived with his stepmother in the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon, and who was to marry a princess with a nose which was three ells long. "How do you happen to know about him?" inquired the old woman; "maybe you are she who ought to have had him." "Yes, indeed, I am," she said. "So it is you, then?" said the old woman; "I know nothing about him but that he dwells in a castle which is east of the sun and west of the moon. You will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you get to it at all; but you shall have the loan of my horse, and then you can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine: perhaps she can tell you about him. When you have got there you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again; but you may take the golden apple with you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='257'>So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode for a long, long way, and at last she came to the mountain, where an aged woman was sitting outside with a gold carding-comb. The girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon; but she said what the first old woman had said: "I know nothing about it, but that it is east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you get there at all; but you shall have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me: perhaps she may know where the castle is, and when you have got to her you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again." Then she gave her the gold carding-comb, for it might, perhaps, be of use to her, she said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='258'>So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode a wearisome long way onward again, and after a very long time she came to a great mountain, where an aged woman was sitting, spinning at a golden spinning-wheel. Of this woman, too, she inquired if she knew the way to the Prince, and where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon. But it was only the same thing once again. "Maybe it was you who should have had the Prince," said the old woman. "Yes, indeed, I should have been the one," said the girl. But this old crone knew the way no better than the others--it was east of the sun and west of the moon, she knew that, "and you will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you get to it at all," she said; "but you may have the loan of my horse, and I think you had better ride to the East Wind, and ask him: perhaps he may know where the castle is, and will blow you thither. But when you have got to him you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear, and he will come home again." And then she gave her the golden spinning-wheel, saying: "Perhaps you may find that you have a use for it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='259'>The girl had to ride for a great many days, and for a long and wearisome time, before she got there; but at last she did arrive, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. "Well," said the East Wind, "I have heard tell of the Prince, and of his castle, but I do not know the way to it, for I have never blown so far; but, if you like, I will go with you to my brother the West Wind: he may know that, for he is much stronger than I am. You may sit on my back, and then I can carry you there." So she seated herself on his back, and they did go so swiftly! When they got there, the East Wind went in and said that the girl whom he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince up at the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon, and that now she was traveling about to find him again, so he had come there with her, and would like to hear if the West Wind knew whereabout the castle was. "No," said the West Wind; "so far as that have I never blown; but if you like I will go with you to the South Wind, for he is much stronger than either of us, and he has roamed far and wide, and perhaps he can tell you what you want to know. You may seat yourself on my back, and then I will carry you to him.".</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='260'>So she did this, and journeyed to the South Wind, neither was she very long on the way. When they had got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon, for she was the girl who ought to marry the Prince who lived there. "Oh, indeed!" said the South Wind, "is that she? Well," said he, "I have wandered about a great deal in my time, and in all kinds of places, but I have never blown so far as that. If you like, however, I will go with you to my brother, the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of all of us, and if he does not know where it is no one in the whole world will be able to tell you. You may sit upon my back, and then I will carry you there." So she seated herself on his back, and off he went from his house in great haste, and they were not long on the way. When they came near the North Wind"s dwelling, he was so wild and frantic that they felt cold gusts a long while before they got there. "What do you want?" he roared out from afar, and they froze as they heard. Said the South Wind: "It is I, and this is she who should have had the Prince who lives in the castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon. And now she wishes to ask you if you have ever been there, and can tell her <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;wish;tell;have;ask;find' valence='6.12' arousal='3.44888888889' dominance='5.82222222222'>the way</entity>, for she would gladly find him again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='261'>"Yes," said the North Wind, "I know where it is. I once blew an aspen leaf there, but I was so tired that for many days afterward I was not able to blow at all. However, if you really are anxious to go there, and are not afraid to go with me, I will take you on my back, and try if I can blow you there."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='262'>"Get there I must," said she; "and if there is any way of going I will; and I have no fear, no matter how fast you go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='263'>"Very well then," said the North Wind; "but you must sleep here to-night, for if we are ever to get there we must have the day before us."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='264'>The North Wind woke her betimes next morning, and puffed himself up, and made himself so big and so strong that it was frightful to see him, and away they went, high up through the air, as if they would not stop until they had reached the very end of the world. Down below there was such a storm! It blew down woods and houses, and when they were above the sea the ships were wrecked by hundreds. And thus they tore on and on, and a long time went by, and then yet more time passed, and still they were above the sea, and the North Wind grew tired, and more tired, and at last so utterly weary that he was scarcely able to blow any longer, and he sank and sank, lower and lower, until at last he went so low that the waves dashed against the heels of the poor girl he was carrying. "Art thou afraid?" said the North Wind. "I have no fear," said she; and it was true. But they were not very, very far from land, and there was just enough strength left in the North Wind to enable him to throw her on to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='land;north;sun;moon;window;strength;west;home;castle;wind' adjectives='own;enough;east;weary' verbs='be;enable;force;rest;leave;wear;go;throw;lay' valence='6.025' arousal='3.74269230769' dominance='5.54307692308'>the shore</entity>, immediately under the windows of a castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon; but then he was so weary and worn out that he was forced to rest for several days before he could go to his own home again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='265'>Next morning she sat down beneath the walls of the castle to play with the golden apple, and the first person she saw was the maiden with the long nose, who was to have the Prince. "How much do you want for that gold apple of yours, girl?" said she, opening the window. "It can"t be bought either for gold or money," answered the girl. "If it cannot be bought either for gold or money, what will buy it? You may say what you please," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;please' valence='6.2525' arousal='4.3675' dominance='6.36'>Princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='266'>"Well, if I may go to the Prince who is here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it," said the girl who had come with the North Wind. "You may do that," said the Princess, for she had made up her mind what she would do. So the Princess got the golden apple, but when the girl went up to the Prince"s apartment that night he was asleep, for the Princess had so contrived it. The poor girl called to him, and shook him, and between whiles she wept; but she could not wake him. In the morning, as soon as day dawned, in came the Princess with the long nose, and drove her out again. In the daytime she sat down once more beneath the windows of the castle, and began to card with her golden carding-comb; and then all happened as it had happened before. The Princess asked her what she wanted for it, and she replied that it was not for sale, either for gold or money, but that if she could get leave to go to the Prince, and be with him during the night, she should have it. But when she went up to the Prince"s room he was again asleep, and, let her call him, or shake him, or weep as she would, he still slept on, and she could not put any life in him. When daylight came in the morning, the Princess with the long nose came too, and once more drove her away. When day had quite come, the girl seated herself under the castle windows, to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and the Princess with the long nose wanted to have that also. So she opened the window, and asked what she would take for it. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='occasion;sale;gold;money' adjectives='former' verbs='be;get;live;leave;say;have;go' valence='6.31' arousal='4.61647058824' dominance='5.75470588235'>The girl</entity> said what she had said on each of the former occasions--that it was not for sale either for gold or for money, but if she could get leave to go to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='occasion;sale;gold;money' adjectives='former' verbs='be;get;live;leave;say;have;go' valence='6.31' arousal='4.61647058824' dominance='5.75470588235'>Prince</entity> who lived there, and be with him during the night, she should have it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='267'>"Yes," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='consent;say' valence='6.058' arousal='4.326' dominance='6.162'>Princess</entity>, "I will gladly consent to that."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='268'>But in that place there were some Christian folk who had been carried off, and they had been sitting in the chamber which was next to that of the Prince, and had heard how a woman had been in there who had wept and called on him two nights running, and they told the Prince of this. So that evening, when the Princess came once more with her sleeping-drink, he pretended to drink, but threw it away behind him, for he suspected that it was a sleeping-drink. So, when the girl went into the Prince"s room this time he was awake, and she had to tell him how she had come there. "You have come just in time," said the Prince, "for I should have been married to-morrow; but I will not have the long-nosed Princess, and you alone can save me. I will say that I want to see what my bride can do, and bid her wash the shirt which has the three drops of tallow on it. This she will consent to do, for she does not know that it is you who let them fall on it; but no one can wash them out but one born of Christian folk: it cannot be done by one of a pack of trolls; and then I will say that no one shall ever be my bride but the woman who can do this, and I know that you can." There was great joy and gladness between them all that night, but the next day, when the wedding was to take place, the Prince said, "I must see what my bride can do." "That you may do," said the stepmother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='269'>"I have a fine shirt which I want to wear as my wedding shirt, but three drops of tallow have got upon it which I want to have washed off, and I have vowed to marry no one but the woman who is able to do it. If she cannot do that, she is not worth having."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='270'>Well, that was a very small matter, they thought, and agreed to do it. The Princess with the long nose began to wash as well as she could, but, the more she washed and rubbed, the larger the spots grew. "Ah! you can"t wash at all," said the old troll-hag, who was her mother. "Give it to me." But she too had not had the shirt very long in her hands before it looked worse still, and, the more she washed it and rubbed it, the larger and blacker grew the spots.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='271'>So the other trolls had to come and wash, but, the more they did, the blacker and uglier grew the shirt, until at length it was as black as if it had been up the chimney. "Oh," cried the Prince, "not one of you is good for anything at all! There is a beggar-girl sitting outside the window, and I"ll be bound that she can wash better than any of you! Come in, you girl there!" he cried. So she came in. "Can you wash this shirt clean?" he cried. "Oh! I don"t know," she said; "but I will try." And no sooner had she taken the shirt and dipped it in the water than it was white as driven snow, and even whiter than that. "I will marry you," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='marry;say' valence='5.752' arousal='4.6' dominance='5.71'>Prince</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='272'>Then the old troll-hag flew into such a rage that she burst, and the Princess with the long nose and all the little trolls must have burst too, for they have never been heard of since. The Prince and his bride set free all the Christian folk who were imprisoned there, and took away with them all the gold and silver that they could carry, and moved far away from the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon.(1)</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='304'>The Queen was so confused that at first she did not notice another little door in the orange tree, but presently it opened and she found herself in a field of thistles and nettles. It was encircled by a muddy ditch, and a little further on was a tiny thatched cottage, out of which came the Yellow Dwarf with a very jaunty air.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='327'>When the Princess saw all these things, and remembered what had happened, she, too, fell into the deepest sadness, which surprised and alarmed the whole Court, and the Queen more than anyone else.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='328'>At last the chief men of the kingdom, anxious to see their Princess married, sent to the Queen to beg her to choose a husband for her as soon as possible. She replied that nothing would please her better, but that her daughter seemed so unwilling to marry, and she recommended them to go and talk to the Princess about it themselves so this they at once did. Now Bellissima was much less proud since her adventure with the Yellow Dwarf, and she could not think of a better way of getting rid of the little monster than to marry some powerful king, therefore she replied to their request much more favorably than they had hoped, saying that, though she was very happy as she was, still, to please them, she would consent to marry the King of the Gold Mines. Now he was a very handsome and powerful Prince, who had been in love with the Princess for years, but had not thought that she would ever care about him at all. You can easily imagine how delighted he was when he heard the news, and how angry it made all the other kings to lose for ever the hope of marrying the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;nobody;news;world;hope;vanity' adjectives='angry;delighted;enough;other;worthy;difficult' verbs='be;make;imagine;find;hear;choose;have;lose;believe;marry' valence='6.04533333333' arousal='4.18633333333' dominance='5.743'>Princess</entity>; but, after all, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;nobody;news;world;hope;vanity' adjectives='angry;delighted;enough;other;worthy;difficult' verbs='be;make;imagine;find;hear;choose;have;lose;believe;marry' valence='6.04533333333' arousal='4.18633333333' dominance='5.743'>Bellissima</entity> could not have married twenty kings--indeed, she had found it quite difficult enough to choose one, for her vanity made her believe that there was nobody in the world who was worthy of her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='329'>Preparations were begun at once for the grandest wedding that had ever been held at the palace. The King of the Gold Mines sent such immense sums of money that the whole sea was covered with the ships that brought it. Messengers were sent to all the gayest and most refined Courts, particularly to the Court of France, to seek out everything rare and precious to adorn the Princess, although her beauty was so perfect that nothing she wore could make her look prettier. At least that is what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mines;gold' adjectives='least;happy' verbs='be;think' valence='6.72142857143' arousal='4.47142857143' dominance='5.88428571429'>the King</entity> of the Gold Mines thought, and he was never happy unless he was with her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='330'>As for the Princess, the more she saw of the King the more she liked him; he was so generous, so handsome and clever, that at last she was almost as much in love with him as he was with her.

This is one that she liked very much:</paragraph>

These were nothing less than diamonds, even to her shoes, which were covered with them, and her dress of silver brocade was embroidered with a dozen of the sun"s rays. You may imagine how much these had cost; but then nothing could have been more brilliant, except the beauty of the Princess!

She wore a ruff of black taffeta, a red velvet hood, and a farthingale all in rags, and she leaned heavily upon a crutch.

	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='346'>The Yellow Dwarf, deeply enraged at these words, set spurs to his cat, which yelled horribly, and leaped hither and thither--terrifying everybody except the brave King, who pursued the Dwarf closely, till he, drawing a great knife with which he was armed, challenged the King to meet him in single combat, and rushed down into the courtyard of the palace with a terrible clatter. The King, quite provoked, followed him hastily, but they had hardly taken their places facing one another, and the whole Court had only just had time to rush out upon the balconies to watch what was going on, when suddenly the sun became as red as blood, and it was so dark that they could scarcely see at all. The thunder crashed, and the lightning seemed as if it must burn up everything; the two basilisks appeared, one on each side of the bad Dwarf, like giants, mountains high, and fire flew from their mouths and ears, until they looked like flaming furnaces. None of these things could terrify the noble young King, and the boldness of his looks and actions reassured those who were looking on, and perhaps even embarrassed the Yellow Dwarf himself; but even _his_ courage gave way when he saw what was happening to his beloved Princess. For the Fairy of the Desert, looking more terrible than before, mounted upon a winged griffin, and with long snakes coiled round her neck, had given her such a blow with the lance she carried that Bellissima fell into the Queen"s arms bleeding and senseless. Her fond mother, feeling as much hurt by the blow as the Princess herself, uttered such piercing cries and lamentations that the King, hearing them, entirely lost his courage and presence of mind. Giving up the combat, he flew toward the Princess, to rescue or to die with her; but the Yellow Dwarf was too quick for him.

But while they were collecting jasper and porphyry, agate and marble, gold and bronze, statues and devices, to immortalize the King"s memory, he was thanking the good Mermaid and begging her still to help him, which she graciously promised to do as she disappeared; and then he set out for the Castle of Steel. He walked fast, looking anxiously round him, and longing once more to see his darling Bellissima, but he had not gone far before he was surrounded by four terrible sphinxes who would very soon have torn him to pieces with their sharp talons if it had not been for the Mermaid"s diamond sword. For, no sooner had he flashed it before their eyes than down they fell at his feet quite helpless, and he killed them with one blow. But he had hardly turned to continue his search when he met six dragons covered with scales that were harder than iron. Frightful as this encounter was the King"s courage was unshaken, and by the aid of his wonderful sword he cut them in pieces one after the other. Now he hoped his difficulties were over, but at the next turning he was met by one which he did not know how to overcome. Four-and-twenty pretty and graceful nymphs advanced toward him, holding garlands of flowers, with which they barred <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nymph;flower;garland' adjectives='graceful;four-and-twenty' verbs='advance;hold;bar' valence='6.30875' arousal='4.32625' dominance='5.88625'>the way</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='414'>The King did not know what to do or to say. It went against all his ideas as a knight to do anything a lady begged him not to do; but, as he hesitated, a voice in his ear said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='594'>There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play ball all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother"s tears and prayers, Aladdin did not mend his ways. One day, when he was playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he was not the son of Mustapha the tailor. "I am, sir," replied Aladdin; "but he died a long while ago." On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying, "I am your uncle, and knew you from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell her I am coming." Aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly found uncle. "Indeed, child," she said, "your father had a brother, but I always thought he was dead." However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and fruit. He presently fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin"s mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise. Next day he bought <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='suit;son;sight;mother;nightfall;home;clothes' adjectives='fine' verbs='be;buy;show;bring;see;overjoy;take' valence='6.40263157895' arousal='4.09736842105' dominance='5.62578947368'>Aladdin</entity> a fine suit of clothes and took him all over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='suit;son;sight;mother;nightfall;home;clothes' adjectives='fine' verbs='be;buy;show;bring;see;overjoy;take' valence='6.40263157895' arousal='4.09736842105' dominance='5.62578947368'>the city</entity>, showing him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='595'>The next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates. They sat down by a fountain and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them. They then journeyed onward till they almost reached the mountains. Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself. At last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley. "We will go no farther," said the false uncle. "I will show you something wonderful; only do you gather up sticks while I kindle a fire." When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him, at the same time saying some magical words. The earth trembled a little and opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by. Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down. "What have I done, uncle?" he said piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: "Fear nothing, but obey me. Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you." At the word treasure Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather. The stone came up quite easily, and some steps appeared. "Go down," said the magician; "at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls. Tuck up your gown and go through them without touching anything, or you will die instantly. These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees. Walk on until you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the oil it contains, and bring it to me." He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ring;finger' adjectives='' verbs='draw;prosper;bid;give' valence='6.39428571429' arousal='4.66571428571' dominance='5.53142857143'>Aladdin</entity>, bidding him prosper.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='596'>Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered some fruit off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth of the cave. The magician cried out in a great hurry: "Make haste and give me the lamp." This Aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='place;stone;passion;powder;something' adjectives='terrible;more' verbs='fly;say;throw;roll' valence='5.27384615385' arousal='4.31769230769' dominance='5.53153846154'>The magician</entity> flew into a terrible passion, and throwing some more powder on to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='place;stone;passion;powder;something' adjectives='terrible;more' verbs='fly;say;throw;roll' valence='5.27384615385' arousal='4.31769230769' dominance='5.53153846154'>the fire</entity>, he said something, and the stone rolled back into its place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='597'>The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that he was no uncle of Aladdin"s, but a cunning magician, who had read in his magic books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful man in the world. Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only receive it from the hand of another. He had picked out the foolish Aladdin for this purpose, intending to get the lamp and kill him afterward.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='598'>For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting. At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring, which the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: "What wouldst thou with me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things." Aladdin fearlessly replied: "Deliver me from this place!" whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside. As soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home, but fainted on the threshold. When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were, in reality, precious stones. He then asked for some food. "Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it." Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly: "Fetch me something to eat!" The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine. Aladdin"s mother, when she came to herself, said: "Whence comes this splendid feast?" "Ask not, but eat," replied Aladdin. So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and have nothing to do with devils. "No," said Aladdin, "since chance hath made us aware of its virtues, we will use it, and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear on my finger." When they had eaten all the genie had brought, Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on until none were left. He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates, and thus they lived for many years.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='599'>One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the Princess, his daughter, went to and from the bath. Aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled. He hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink. The Princess lifted her veil as she went in, and looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight. He went home so changed that his mother was frightened. He told her he loved the Princess so deeply that he could not live without her, and meant to ask her in marriage of her father. His mother, on hearing this, burst out laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request. She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels. She took these with her to please the Sultan, and set out, trusting in the lamp. The Grand Vizier and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan. He, however, took no notice of her. She went every day for a week, and stood in the same place. When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said to his Vizier: "I see a certain woman in the audience-chamber every day carrying something in a napkin. Call her next time, that I may find out what she wants." Next day, at a sign from the Vizier, she went up to the foot of the throne and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her: "Rise, good woman, and tell me what you want." She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the Vizier, and bade her speak frankly, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she might say. She then told him of her son"s violent love for the Princess. "I prayed him to forget her," she said, "but in vain; he threatened to do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty for the hand of the Princess. Now I pray you to forgive not me alone, but my son Aladdin." The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin, whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them. He was thunderstruck, and turning to the Vizier said: "What sayest thou? Ought I not to bestow the Princess on one who values her at such a price?" The Vizier, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to withhold her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present. The Sultan granted this, and told <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;mother;marriage;sultan' adjectives='' verbs='appear;consent;tell;grant' valence='5.817' arousal='4.026' dominance='5.382'>Aladdin</entity>"s mother that, though he consented to the marriage, she must not appear before him again for three months.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='600'>Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months, but after two had elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found every one rejoicing, and asked what was going on. "Do you not know," was the answer, "that the son of the Grand Vizier is to marry the Sultan"s daughter to-night?" Breathless, she ran and told Aladdin, who was overwhelmed at first, but presently bethought him of the lamp. He rubbed it, and the genie appeared, saying, "What is thy will?" Aladdin replied: "The Sultan, as thou knowest, has broken his promise to me, and the Vizier"s son is to have the Princess. My command is that to-night you bring hither the bride and bridegroom." "Master, I obey," said the genie. Aladdin then went to his chamber, where, sure enough, at midnight the genie transported the bed containing the Vizier"s son and the Princess. "Take this new-married man," he said, "and put him outside in the cold, and return at daybreak." Whereupon the genie took the Vizier"s son out of bed, leaving Aladdin with the Princess. "Fear nothing," Aladdin said to her; "you are my wife, promised to me by your unjust father, and no harm shall come to you." The Princess was too frightened to speak, and passed the most miserable night of her life, while Aladdin lay down beside her and slept soundly. At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom, laid him in his place, and transported <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bridegroom;genie;place' adjectives='' verbs='appoint;shiver;fetch;transport;lay' valence='5.67416666667' arousal='3.85916666667' dominance='5.55'>the bed</entity> back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bridegroom;genie;place' adjectives='' verbs='appoint;shiver;fetch;transport;lay' valence='5.67416666667' arousal='3.85916666667' dominance='5.55'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='601'>Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter good-morning. The unhappy Vizier"s son jumped up and hid himself, while the Princess would not say a word, and was very sorrowful. The Sultan sent her mother to her, who said: "How comes it, child, that you will not speak to your father? What has happened?" The Princess sighed deeply, and at last told her mother how, during the night, the bed had been carried into some strange house, and what had passed there. Her mother did not believe her in the least, but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='602'>The following night exactly the same thing happened, and next morning, on the Princess"s refusal to speak, the Sultan threatened to cut off her head. She then confessed all, bidding him to ask the Vizier"s son if it were not so. The Sultan told the Vizier to ask his son, who owned the truth, adding that, dearly as he loved the Princess, he had rather die than go through another such fearful night, and wished to be separated from her. His wish was granted, and there was an end to feasting and rejoicing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='603'>When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind the Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as before, and the Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him, and sent for her. On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less inclined than ever to keep his word, and asked his Vizier"s advice, who counselled him to set so high a value on the Princess that no man living could come up to it. The Sultan then turned to Aladdin"s mother, saying: "Good woman, a Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels, carried by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones, splendidly dressed. Tell him that I await his answer." The mother of Aladdin bowed low and went home, thinking all was lost. She gave Aladdin the message, adding: "He may wait long enough for your answer!" "Not so long, mother, as you think," her son replied. "I would do a great deal more than that for the Princess." He summoned the genie, and in a few moments the eighty slaves arrived, and filled up the small house and garden. Aladdin made them set out to the palace, two and two, followed by his mother. They were so richly dressed, with such splendid jewels in their girdles, that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on their heads. They entered the palace, and, after kneeling before the Sultan, stood in a half-circle round the throne with their arms crossed, while Aladdin"s mother presented them to the Sultan. He hesitated no longer, but said: "Good woman, return and tell your son that I wait for him with open arms." She lost no time in telling Aladdin, bidding him make haste. But Aladdin first called the genie. "I want a scented bath," he said, "a richly embroidered habit, a horse surpassing the Sultan"s, and twenty slaves to attend me. Besides this, six slaves, beautifully dressed, to wait on my mother; and lastly, ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses." No sooner said than done. Aladdin mounted his horse and passed through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went. Those who had played with him in his childhood knew him not, he had grown so handsome. When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to marry him to the Princess that very day. But Aladdin refused, saying, "I must build a palace fit for her," and took his leave. Once home, he said to the genie: "Build me a palace of the finest marble, set with jasper, agate, and other precious stones. In the middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome, its four walls of massy gold and silver, each having six windows, whose lattices, all except one which is to be left unfinished, must be set with diamonds and rubies. There must be stables and horses and grooms and slaves; go and see about it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='604'>The palace was finished by the next day, and the genie carried him there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out, even to the laying of a velvet carpet from Aladdin"s palace to the Sultan"s. Aladdin"s mother then dressed herself carefully, and walked to the palace with her slaves, while he followed her on horseback. The Sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them, so that the air resounded with music and cheers. She was taken to the Princess, who saluted her and treated her with great honor. At night the Princess said good-by to her father, and set out on the carpet for Aladdin"s palace, with his mother at her side, and followed by the hundred slaves. She was charmed at the sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive her. "Princess," he said, "blame your beauty for my boldness if I have displeased you." She told him that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her father in this matter. After the wedding had taken place Aladdin led her into the hall, where a feast was spread, and she supped with him, after which they danced till midnight. Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace. On entering the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their rubies, diamonds, and emeralds, he cried: "It is a world"s wonder! There is only one thing that surprises me. Was it by accident that one window was left unfinished?" "No, sir, by design," returned Aladdin. "I wished your Majesty to have the glory of finishing this palace." The Sultan was pleased, and sent for the best jewelers in the city. He showed them the unfinished window, and bade them fit it up like the others. "Sir," replied their spokesman, "we cannot find jewels enough." The Sultan had his own fetched, which they soon used, but to no purpose, for in a month"s time the work was not half done. Aladdin, knowing that their task was vain, bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back, and the genie finished the window at his command. The Sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again, and visited Aladdin, who showed him the window finished. The Sultan embraced him, the envious Vizier meanwhile hinting that it was the work of enchantment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='605'>Aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing. He was made captain of the Sultan"s armies, and won several battles for him, but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived thus in peace and content for several years.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='606'>But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin, and by his magic arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of perishing miserably in the cave, had escaped, and had married a princess, with whom he was living in great honor and wealth. He knew that the poor tailor"s son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp, and traveled night and day until he reached the capital of China, bent on Aladdin"s ruin. As he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace. "Forgive my ignorance," he asked, "what is this palace you speak Of?" "Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin"s palace," was the reply, "the greatest wonder of the world? I will direct you if you have a mind to see it." The magician thanked him who spoke, and having seen the palace, knew that it had been raised by the Genie of the Lamp, and became half mad with rage. He determined to get hold of the lamp, and again plunge <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='plunge;lamp;hold;poverty' adjectives='deepest' verbs='determine;get' valence='5.08333333333' arousal='4.30333333333' dominance='5.25'>Aladdin</entity> into the deepest poverty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='607'>Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting for eight days, which gave the magician plenty of time. He bought a dozen copper lamps, put them into a basket, and went to the palace, crying: "New lamps for old!" followed by a jeering crowd. The Princess, sitting in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, sent a slave to find out what the noise was about, who came back laughing, so that the Princess scolded her. "Madam," replied the slave, "who can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones?" Another slave, hearing this, said: "There is an old one on the cornice there which he can have." Now this was the magic lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as he could not take it out hunting with him. The Princess, not knowing its value, laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange. She went and said to the magician: "Give me a new lamp for this." He snatched it and bade the slave take her choice, amid the jeers of the crowd. Little he cared, but left off crying his lamps, and went out of the city gates to a lonely place, where he remained till nightfall, when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it. The genie appeared, and at <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='genie;command;place' adjectives='lonely' verbs='carry;s;appear' valence='5.37818181818' arousal='4.40727272727' dominance='5.28090909091'>the magician</entity>"s command carried him, together with <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='genie;command;place' adjectives='lonely' verbs='carry;s;appear' valence='5.37818181818' arousal='4.40727272727' dominance='5.28090909091'>the palace</entity> and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='genie;command;place' adjectives='lonely' verbs='carry;s;appear' valence='5.37818181818' arousal='4.40727272727' dominance='5.28090909091'>Princess</entity> in it, to a lonely place in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='genie;command;place' adjectives='lonely' verbs='carry;s;appear' valence='5.37818181818' arousal='4.40727272727' dominance='5.28090909091'>Africa</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='608'>Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window toward Aladdin"s palace and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. He sent for the Vizier and asked what had become of the palace. The Vizier looked out too, and was lost in astonishment. He again put it down to enchantment, and this time the Sultan believed him, and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains. They met him riding home, bound him, and forced him to go with them on foot. The people, however, who loved him, followed, armed, to see that he came to no harm. He was carried before the Sultan, who ordered the executioner to cut off his head. The executioner made Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes, and raised his scimitar to strike. At that instant the Vizier, who saw that the crowd had forced their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue Aladdin, called to the executioner to stay his hand. The people, indeed, looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be unbound, and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd. Aladdin now begged to know what he had done. "False wretch!" said the Sultan, "come thither," and showed him from the window the place where his palace had stood. Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word. "Where is my palace and my daughter?" demanded the Sultan. "For the first I am not so deeply concerned, but my daughter I must have, and you must find her or lose your head." Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her, promising, if he failed, to return and suffer death at the Sultan"s pleasure. His prayer was granted, and he went forth sadly from the Sultan"s presence. For three days he wandered about like a madman, asking everyone what had become of his palace, but they only laughed and pitied him. He came to the banks of a river, and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in. In so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore. The genie he had seen in the cave appeared, and asked his will. "Save my life, genie," said Aladdin, "bring my palace back." "That is not in my power," said the genie; "I am only the Slave of the Ring; you must ask him of the lamp." "Even so," said Aladdin, "but thou canst take me to the palace, and set me down under my dear wife"s window." He at once found himself in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='weariness' adjectives='sheer' verbs='find;fall' valence='6.055' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.16166666667'>Africa</entity>, under <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='weariness' adjectives='sheer' verbs='find;fall' valence='6.055' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.16166666667'>the window</entity> of the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='weariness' adjectives='sheer' verbs='find;fall' valence='6.055' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.16166666667'>Princess</entity>, and fell asleep out of sheer weariness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='609'>He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and his heart was lighter. He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='610'>That morning the Princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she was forced to endure once a day. She, however, treated him so harshly that he dared not live there altogether. As she was dressing, one of her women looked out and saw Aladdin. The Princess ran and opened the window, and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up. She called to him to come to her, and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again. After he had kissed her Aladdin said: "I beg of you, Princess, in God"s name, before we speak of anything else, for your own sake and mine, tell me that has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting." "Alas!" she said, "I am the innocent cause of our sorrows," and told him of the exchange of the lamp. "Now I know," cried Aladdin, "that we have to thank the African magician for this! Where is the lamp?" "He carries it about with him," said the Princess. "I know, for he pulled it out of his breast to show me. He wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him, saying that you were beheaded by my father"s command. He is for ever speaking ill of you but I only reply by my tears. If I persist, I doubt not but he will use violence." Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while. He changed clothes with the first person he met in the town, and having bought a certain powder, returned to the Princess, who let him in by a little side door. "Put on your most beautiful dress," he said to her "and receive the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you have forgotten me. Invite him to sup with you, and say you wish to taste the wine of his country. He will go for some and while he is gone I will tell you what to do." She listened carefully to Aladdin and when he left she arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left China. She put on a girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and, seeing in a glass that she was more beautiful than ever, received the magician, saying, to his great amazement: "I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that all my tears will not bring him back to me, so I am resolved to mourn no more, and have therefore invited you to sup with me; but I am tired of the wines of China, and would fain taste those of Africa." The magician flew to his cellar, and the Princess put the powder Aladdin had given her in her cup. When he returned she asked him to drink her health in the wine of Africa, handing him her cup in exchange for his, as a sign she was reconciled to him. Before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty, but the Princess cut him short, saying: "Let us drink first, and you shall say what you will afterward." She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless. The Princess then opened the door to Aladdin, and flung her arms round his neck; but Aladdin put her away, bidding her leave him, as he had more to do. He then went to the dead magician, took the lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to China. This was done, and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thought;chamber;shock;home' adjectives='little' verbs='feel;be;do' valence='6.05583333333' arousal='4.18333333333' dominance='5.68416666667'>Princess</entity> in her chamber only felt two little shocks, and little thought she was at home again.</paragraph>

He hastened thither, and Aladdin received him in the hall of the four-and-twenty windows, with the Princess at his side. Aladdin told him what had happened, and showed him the dead body of the magician, that he might believe.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='612'>The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible, more wicked and more cunning than himself. He traveled to China to avenge his brother"s death, and went to visit a pious woman called Fatima, thinking she might be of use to him. He entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast, telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death. He changed clothes with her, colored his face like hers, put on her veil, and murdered her, that she might tell no tales. Then he went toward the palace of Aladdin, and all the people, thinking he was the holy woman, gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his blessing. When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the Princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter. The slave said it was the holy woman, curing people by her touch of their ailments, whereupon the Princess, who had long desired to see Fatima, sent for her. On coming to the Princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity. When he had done the Princess made him sit by her, and begged him to stay with her always. The false Fatima, who wished for nothing better, consented, but kept his veil down for fear of discovery. The Princess showed him the hall, and asked him what he thought of it. "It is truly beautiful," said the false Fatima. "In my mind it wants but one thing." "And what is that?" said the Princess. "If only a roc"s egg," replied he, "were hung up from the middle of this dome, it would be the wonder of the world."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='613'>After this the Princess could think of nothing but the roc"s egg, and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humor. He begged to know what was amiss, and she told him that all her pleasure in the hall was spoiled for the want of a roc"s egg hanging from the dome. "If that is all," replied Aladdin, "you shall soon be happy." He left her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appeared commanded him to bring a roc"s egg. The genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that the hall shook. "Wretch!" he cried, "is it not enough that I have done everything for you, but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the midst of this dome? You and your wife and your palace deserve to be burnt to ashes, but that this request does not come from you, but from the brother of the African magician, whom you destroyed. He is now in your palace disguised as the holy woman--whom he murdered. He it was who put that wish into your wife"s head. Take care of yourself, for he means to kill you." So saying, the genie disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='614'>Aladdin went back to the Princess, saying his head ached, and requesting that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it. But when the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger, pierced him to the heart. "What have you done?" cried the Princess. "You have killed the holy woman!"

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='618'>THE TALE OF A YOUTH WHO SET OUT TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='619'>A father had two sons, of whom the eldest was clever and bright, and always knew what he was about; but the youngest was stupid, and couldn"t learn or understand anything. So much so that those who saw him exclaimed: "What a burden he"ll be to his father!" Now when there was anything to be done, the eldest had always to do it; but if something was required later or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard or some such ghostly place, he always replied: "Oh! no, father: nothing will induce me to go there, it makes me shudder!" for he was afraid. Or, when they sat of an evening around the fire telling stories which made one"s flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: "Oh! it makes one shudder," the youngest sat in a corner, heard the exclamation, and could not understand what it meant. "They are always saying it makes one shudder! it makes one shudder! Nothing makes me shudder. It"s probably an art quite beyond me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='620'>Now it happened that his father said to him one day: "Hearken, you there in the corner; you are growing big and strong, and you must learn to earn your own bread. Look at your brother, what pains he takes; but all the money I"ve spent on your education is thrown away." "My dear father," he replied, "I will gladly learn--in fact, if it were possible I should like to learn to shudder; I don"t understand that a bit yet." The eldest laughed when he heard this, and thought to himself: "Good heavens! what a ninny my brother is! he"ll never come to any good; as the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined." The father sighed, and answered him: "You"ll soon learn to shudder; but that won"t help you to make a living."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='621'>Shortly after this, when the sexton came to pay them a visit, the father broke out to him, and told him what a bad hand his youngest son was at everything: he knew nothing and learned nothing. "Only think! when I asked him how he purposed gaining a livelihood, he actually asked to be taught to shudder." "If that"s all he wants," said the sexton, "I can teach him that; just you send him to me, I"ll soon polish him up." The father was quite pleased with the proposal, because he thought: "It will be a good discipline for the youth." And so the sexton took him into his house, and his duty was to toll the bell. After a few days he woke him at midnight, and bade him rise and climb into the tower and toll. "Now, my friend, I"ll teach you to shudder," thought he. He stole forth secretly in front, and when the youth was up above, and had turned round to grasp the bell-rope, he saw, standing opposite the hole of the belfry, a white figure. "Who"s there?" he called out, but the figure gave no answer, and neither stirred nor moved. "Answer," cried the youth, "or begone; you have no business here at this hour of the night." But the sexton remained motionless, so that the youth might think that it was a ghost. The youth called out the second time: "What do you want here? Speak if you are an honest fellow, or I"ll knock you down the stairs." The sexton thought: "He can"t mean that in earnest," so gave forth no sound, and stood as though he were made of stone. Then the youth shouted out to him the third time, and as that too had no effect, he made a dash at the spectre and knocked it down the stairs, so that it fell about ten steps and remained lying in a corner. Thereupon he tolled the bell, went home to bed without saying a word, and fell asleep. The sexton"s wife waited a long time for her husband, but he never appeared. At last she became anxious, and woke the youth, and asked: "Don"t you know where my husband is? He went up to the tower in front of you." "No," answered the youth; "but someone stood on the stairs up there just opposite the trap-door in the belfry, and because he wouldn"t answer me, or go away, I took him for a rogue and knocked him down. You"d better go and see if it was he; I should be much distressed if it were." The wife ran and found her husband who was lying groaning in a corner, with his leg broken.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='622'>She carried him down, and then hurried with loud protestations to the youth"s father. "Your son has been the cause of a pretty misfortune," she cried; "he threw my husband downstairs so that he broke his leg. Take the good-for-nothing wretch out of our house." The father was horrified, hurried to the youth, and gave him a scolding.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='623'>"What unholy pranks are these? The evil one must have put them into your head." "Father," he replied, "only listen to me; I am quite guiltless. He stood there in the night, like one who meant harm. I didn"t know who it was, and warned him three times to speak or begone." "Oh!" groaned the father, "you"ll bring me nothing but misfortune; get out of my sight, I won"t have anything more to do with you." "Yes, father, willingly; only wait till daylight, then I"ll set out and learn to shudder, and in that way I shall be master of an art which will gain me a living." "Learn what you will," said the father, "it"s all one to me. Here are fifty dollars for you, set forth into the wide world with them; but see you tell no one where you come from or who your father is, for I am ashamed of you." "Yes, father, whatever you wish; and if that"s all you ask, I can easily keep it in mind."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='624'>When day broke the youth put the fifty dollars into his pocket, set out on the hard high road, and kept muttering to himself: "If I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!" Just at this moment a man came by who heard the youth speaking to himself, and when they had gone on a bit and were in sight of the gallows the man said to him: "Look! there is the tree where seven people have been hanged, and are now learning to fly; sit down under it and wait till nightfall, and then you"ll pretty soon learn to shudder." "If that"s all I have to do," answered the youth, "it"s easily done; but if I learn to shudder so quickly, then you shall have my fifty dollars. Just come back to me to-morrow morning early." Then the youth went to the gallows-tree and sat down underneath it, and waited for the evening; and because he felt cold he lit himself a fire. But at midnight it got so chill that in spite of the fire he couldn"t keep warm. And as the wind blew the corpses one against the other, tossing them to and fro, he thought to himself: "If you are perishing down here by the fire, how those poor things up there must be shaking and shivering!" And because he had a tender heart, he put up a ladder, which he climbed unhooked one body after the other, and took down all the seven. Then he stirred the fire, blew it up, and placed them all round in a circle, that they might warm themselves. But they sat there and did not move, and the fire caught their clothes. Then he spoke: "Take care, or I"ll hang you up again." But the dead men did not hear and let their rags go on burning. Then he got angry, and said: "If you aren"t careful yourselves, then I can"t help you, and I don"t mean to burn with you"; and he hung them up again in a row. Then he sat down at his fire and fell asleep. On the following morning the man came to him, and, wishing to get his fifty dollars, said: "Now you know what it is to shudder." "No," he answered, "how should I? Those fellows up there never opened their mouths, and were so stupid that they let those few old tatters they have on their bodies burn." Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='person;life;m;t' adjectives='' verbs='wouldn;get;say;bless;see;go;meet' valence='5.75058823529' arousal='4.45294117647' dominance='5.44882352941'>the man</entity> saw he wouldn"t get his fifty dollars that day, and went off, saying: "Well, I"m blessed if I ever met such a person in my life before."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='625'>The youth went too on his way, and began to murmur to himself: "Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!" A carrier who was walking behind him heard these words, and asked him: "Who are you" "I don"t know," said the youth. "Where do you hail from?" "I don"t know." "Who"s your father?" "I mayn"t say." "What are you constantly muttering to yourself?" "Oh!" said the youth, "I would give worlds to shudder, but no one can teach me." "Stuff and nonsense!" spoke the carrier; "come along with me, and I"ll soon put that right." The youth went with the carrier, and in the evening they reached an inn, where they were to spend the night. Then, just as he was entering the room, he said again, quite aloud: "Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!" The landlord, who heard this, laughed and said: "If that"s what you"re sighing for, you shall be given every opportunity here." "Oh! hold your tongue!" said the landlord"s wife; "so many people have paid for their curiosity with their lives, it were a thousand pities if those beautiful eyes were never again to behold daylight." But the youth said: "No matter how difficult, I insist on learning it; why, that"s what I"ve set out to do." He left the landlord no peace till he told him that in the neighborhood stood a haunted castle, where one could easily learn to shudder if one only kept watch in it for three nights. The King had promised the man who dared to do this thing his daughter as wife, and she was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. There was also much treasure hid in the castle, guarded by evil spirits, which would then be free, and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich. Many had already gone in, but so far none had ever come out again. So the youth went to the King and spoke: "If I were allowed, I should much like to watch for three nights in the castle." The King looked at him, and because he pleased him, he said: "You can ask for three things, none of them living, and those you may take with you into the castle." Then he answered: "Well, I shall beg for a fire, a turning lathe, and a carving bench with the knife attached."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='626'>On the following day the King had everything put into the castle; and when night drew on the youth took up his position there, lit a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the carving bench with the knife close to it, and sat himself down on the turning lathe. "Oh! if I could only shudder!" he said: "but I sha"n"t learn it here either." Toward midnight he wanted to make up the fire, and as he was blowing up a blaze he heard a shriek from a corner. "Ou, miou! how cold we are!" "You fools!" he cried; "why do you scream? If you are cold, come and sit at the fire and warm yourselves." And as he spoke two huge black cats sprang fiercely forward and sat down, one on each side of him, and gazed wildly at him with their fiery eyes. After a time, when they had warmed themselves, they said: "Friend, shall we play a little game of cards?" "Why not?" he replied; "but first let me see your paws." Then they stretched out their claws. "Ha!" said he; "what long nails you"ve got! Wait a minute: I must first cut them off." Thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their necks, lifted them on to the carving bench, and screwed down their paws firmly. "After watching you narrowly," said he, "I no longer feel any desire to play cards with you"; and with these words he struck them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had thus sent the two of them to their final rest, and was again about to sit down at the fire, out of every nook and corner came forth black cats and black dogs with fiery chains in such swarms that he couldn"t possibly get away from them. They yelled in the most ghastly manner, jumped upon his fire, scattered it all, and tried to put it out. He looked on quietly for a time, but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife and called out: "Be off, you rabble rout!" and let fly at them. Some of them fled away, and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the pond below. When he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once more, and warmed himself. And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer, and a desire to sleep stole over him. Then he looked around him and beheld in the corner a large bed. "The very thing," he said, and laid himself down in it. But when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by itself, and ran all round the castle. "Capital," he said, "only a little quicker." Then the bed sped on as if drawn by six horses, over thresholds and stairs, up this way and down that. All of a sudden--crash, crash! with a bound it turned over, upside down, and lay like a mountain on the top of him. But he tossed the blankets and pillows in the air, emerged from underneath, and said: "Now anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive," lay down at his fire, and slept till daylight. In the morning the King came, and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much for him, and that he was dead. Then he said: "What a pity! and such a fine fellow he was." The youth heard this, got up, and said: "It"s not come to that yet." Then the King was astonished, but very glad, and asked how it had fared with him. "First-rate," he answered; "and now I"ve survived the one night, I shall get through the other two also." The landlord, when he went to him, opened his eyes wide, and said: "Well, I never thought to see you alive again. Have you learned now what shuddering is?" "No," he replied, "it"s quite hopeless; if someone could only tell me how to!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='627'>The second night he went up again to the old castle, sat down at the fire, and began his old refrain: "If I could only shudder!" As midnight approached, a noise and din broke out, at first gentle, but gradually increasing; then all was quiet for a minute, and at length, with a loud scream, half of a man dropped down the chimney and fell before him. "Hi, up there!" shouted he; "there"s another half wanted down here, that"s not enough"; then the din commenced once more, there was a shrieking and a yelling, and then the other half fell down. "Wait a bit," he said; "I"ll stir up the fire for you." When he had done this and again looked around, the two pieces had united, and a horrible-looking man sat on his seat. "Come," said the youth, "I didn"t bargain for that, the seat is mine." The man tried to shove him away, but the youth wouldn"t allow it for a moment, and, pushing him off by force, sat down in his place again. Then more men dropped down, one after the other, who fetching nine skeleton legs and two skulls, put them up and played ninepins with them. The youth thought he would like to play too, and said: "Look here; do you mind my joining the game?" "No, not if you have money." "I"ve money enough," he replied, "but your balls aren"t round enough." Then he took the skulls, placed them on his lathe, and turned them till they were round. "Now they"ll roll along better," said he, "and houp-la! now the fun begins." He played with them and lost some of his money, but when twelve struck everything vanished before his eyes. He lay down and slept peacefully. The next morning the King came, anxious for news. "How have you got on this time?" he asked. "I played ninepins," he answered, "and lost a few pence." "Didn"t you shudder then?" "No such luck," said he; "I made myself merry. Oh! if I only knew what it was to shudder!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='628'>On the third night he sat down again on his bench, and said, in the most desponding way: "If I could only shudder!" When it got late, six big men came in carrying a coffin. Then he cried: "Ha! ha! that"s most likely my little cousin who only died a few days ago"; and beckoning with his finger he called out: "Come, my small cousin, come." They placed the coffin on the ground, and he approached it and took off the cover. In it lay a dead man. He felt his face, and it was cold as ice. "Wait," he said "I"ll heat you up a bit," went to the fire, warmed his hand, and laid it on the man"s face, but the dead remained cold. Then he lifted him out, sat down at the fire, laid him on his knee, and rubbed his arms that the blood should circulate again. When that too had no effect it occurred to him that if two people lay together in bed they warmed each other; so he put him into the bed, covered him up, and lay down beside him; after a time the corpse became warm and began to move. Then the youth said: "Now, my little cousin, what would have happened if I hadn"t warmed you?" But the dead man rose up and cried out: "Now I will strangle you." "What!" said he, "is that all the thanks I get? You should be put straight back into your coffin," lifted him up, threw him in, and closed the lid. Then the six men came and carried him out again. "I simply can"t shudder," he said, "and it"s clear I sha"n"t learn it in a lifetime here."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='629'>Then a man entered, of more than ordinary size and of a very fearful appearance; but he was old and had a white beard. "Oh! you miserable creature, now you will soon know what it is to shudder," he cried, "for you must die." "Not so quickly," answered the youth. "If I am to die, you must catch me first." "I shall soon lay hold of you," spoke the monster. "Gently, gently, don"t boast too much, I"m as strong as you, and stronger too." "We"ll soon see," said the old man; "if you are stronger than I then I"ll let you off; come, let"s have a try." Then he led him through some dark passages to a forge, and grasping an axe he drove one of the anvils with a blow into the earth. "I can do better than that," cried the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man drew near him in order to watch closely, and his white beard hung right down. The youth seized the axe, cleft the anvil open, and jammed in the old man"s beard. "Now I have you," said the youth; "this time it"s your turn to die." Then he seized an iron rod and belabored the old man till he, whimpering, begged him to leave off, and he would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back to the castle and showed him in a cellar three chests of gold. "One of these," said he, "belongs to the poor, one to the King, and the third is yours." At that moment twelve struck, and the spirit vanished, leaving the youth alone in the dark. "I"ll surely be able to find a way out," said he, and groping about he at length found his way back to the room, and fell asleep at his fire. The next morning the King came, and said: "Well, now you"ve surely learned to shudder?" "No," he answered; "what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and an old bearded man came, who showed me heaps of money down below there, but what shuddering is no one has told me." Then the King spoke: "You have freed the castle from its curse, and you shall marry my daughter." "That"s all charming," he said; "but I still don"t know what it is to shudder."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='630'>Then the gold was brought up, and the wedding was celebrated, but the young King, though he loved his wife dearly, and though he was very happy, still kept on saying: "If I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!" At last he reduced her to despair. Then her maid said: "I"ll help you; we"ll soon make him shudder." So she went out to the stream that flowed through the garden, and had a pail full of little gudgeons brought to her. At night, when the young King was asleep, his wife had to pull the clothes off him, and pour the pail full of little gudgeons over him, so that the little fish swam all about him. Then he awoke and cried out: "Oh! how I shudder, how I shudder, dear wife! Yes, now I know what shuddering is."(1)</paragraph>

Now it happened one day that he had an audience with the King, and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold. "Now that"s a talent worth having," said the King to the miller; "if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to my palace to-morrow, and I"ll put her to the test." When the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle, and said: "Now set to work and spin all night till early dawn, and if by that time you haven"t spun the straw into gold you shall die."

She hadn"t the least idea of how to spin straw into gold, and became at last so miserable that she began to cry. Suddenly the door opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said: "Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so bitterly?" "Oh!" answered the girl, "I have to spin straw into gold, and haven"t a notion how it"s done." "What will you give me if I spin it for you?" asked the manikin. "My necklace," replied the girl. The little man took the necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the bobbin was full. Then he put on another, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the second too was full; and so it went on till the morning, when all the straw was spun away, and all the bobbins were full of gold. As soon as the sun rose the King came, and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious metal. He had the miller"s daughter put into another room full of straw, much bigger than the first, and bade her, if she valued her life, spin it all into gold before the following morning. The girl didn"t know what to do, and began to cry; then the door opened as before, and the tiny little man appeared and said: "What"ll you give me if I spin the straw into gold for you?" "The ring from my finger," answered the girl. The manikin took the ring, and whir! round went the spinning-wheel again, and when morning broke he had spun all the straw into glittering gold. The King was pleased beyond measure at the sights but his greed for gold was still not satisfied, and he had the miller"s daughter brought into a yet bigger room full of straw, and said: "You must spin all this away in the night; but if you succeed this time you shall become my wife." "She"s only a miller"s daughter, it"s true," he thought; "but I couldn"t find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over." When the girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time, and said: "What"ll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?" "I"ve nothing more to give," answered the girl. "Then promise me when you are Queen to give me your first child." "Who knows what may not happen before that?" thought the miller"s daughter; and besides, she saw no other way out of it, so she promised the manikin what he demanded, and he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='645'>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='646'>Once upon a time, in a very far-off country, there lived a merchant who had been so fortunate in all his undertakings that he was enormously rich. As he had, however, six sons and six daughters, he found that his money was not too much to let them all have everything they fancied, as they were accustomed to do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='647'>But one day a most unexpected misfortune befell them. Their house caught fire and was speedily burnt to the ground, with all the splendid furniture, the books, pictures, gold, silver, and precious goods it contained; and this was only the beginning of their troubles. Their father, who had until this moment prospered in all ways, suddenly lost every ship he had upon the sea, either by dint of pirates, shipwreck, or fire. Then he heard that his clerks in distant countries, whom he trusted entirely, had proved unfaithful; and at last from great wealth he fell into the direst poverty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='648'>All that he had left was a little house in a desolate place at least a hundred leagues from the town in which he had lived, and to this he was forced to retreat with his children, who were in despair at the idea of leading such a different life. Indeed, the daughters at first hoped that their friends, who had been so numerous while they were rich, would insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed one. But they soon found that they were left alone, and that their former friends even attributed their misfortunes to their own extravagance, and showed no intention of offering them any help. So nothing was left for them but to take their departure to the cottage, which stood in the midst of a dark forest, and seemed to be the most dismal place upon the face of the earth. As they were too poor to have any servants, the girls had to work hard, like peasants, and the sons, for their part, cultivated the fields to earn their living. Roughly clothed, and living in the simplest way, the girls regretted unceasingly the luxuries and amusements of their former life; only the youngest tried to be brave and cheerful. She had been as sad as anyone when misfortune overtook her father, but, soon recovering her natural gaiety, she set to work to make the best of things, to amuse her father and brothers as well as she could, and to try to persuade her sisters to join her in dancing and singing. But they would do nothing of the sort, and, because she was not as doleful as themselves, they declared that this miserable life was all she was fit for. But she was really far prettier and cleverer than they were; indeed, she was so lovely that she was always called Beauty. After two years, when they were all beginning to get used to their new life, something happened to disturb their tranquillity. Their father received the news that one of his ships, which he had believed to be lost, had come safely into port with a rich cargo. All the sons and daughters at once thought that their poverty was at an end, and wanted to set out directly for the town; but their father, who was more prudent, begged them to wait a little, and, though it was harvest time, and he could ill be spared, determined to go himself first, to make inquiries. Only the youngest daughter had any doubt but that they would soon again be as rich as they were before, or at least rich enough to live comfortably in some town where they would find amusement and gay companions once more. So they all loaded their father with commissions for jewels and dresses which it would have taken a fortune to buy; only Beauty, feeling sure that it was of no use, did not ask for anything. Her father, noticing her silence, said: "And what shall I bring for you, Beauty?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='649'>"The only thing I wish for is to see you come home safely," she answered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='650'>But this only vexed her sisters, who fancied she was blaming them for having asked for such costly things. Her father, however, was pleased, but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like pretty presents, he told her to choose something.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='651'>"Well, dear father," she said, "as you insist upon it, I beg that you will bring me a rose. I have not seen one since we came here, and I love them so much."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='652'>So the merchant set out and reached the town as quickly as possible, but only to find that his former companions, believing him to be dead, had divided between them the goods which the ship had brought; and after six months of trouble and expense he found himself as poor as when he started, having been able to recover only just enough to pay the cost of his journey. To make matters worse, he was obliged to leave the town in the most terrible weather, so that by the time he was within a few leagues of his home he was almost exhausted with cold and fatigue. Though he knew it would take some hours to get through the forest, he was so anxious to be at his journey"s end that he resolved to go on; but night overtook him, and the deep snow and bitter frost made it impossible for his horse to carry him any further. Not a house was to be seen; the only shelter he could get was the hollow trunk of a great tree, and there he crouched all the night which seemed to him the longest he had ever known. In spite of his weariness the howling of the wolves kept him awake, and even when at last the day broke he was not much better off, for the falling snow had covered up every path, and he did not know which way to turn.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='653'>At length he made out some sort of track, and though at the beginning it was so rough and slippery that he fell down more than once, it presently became easier, and led him into an avenue of trees which ended in a splendid castle. It seemed to the merchant very strange that no snow had fallen in the avenue, which was entirely composed of orange trees, covered with flowers and fruit. When he reached the first court of the castle he saw before him a flight of agate steps, and went up them, and passed through several splendidly furnished rooms. The pleasant warmth of the air revived him, and he felt very hungry; but there seemed to be nobody in all this vast and splendid palace whom he could ask to give him something to eat. Deep silence reigned everywhere, and at last, tired of roaming through empty rooms and galleries, he stopped in a room smaller than the rest, where a clear fire was burning and a couch was drawn up closely to it. Thinking that this must be prepared for someone who was expected, he sat down to wait till he should come, and very soon fell into a sweet sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='654'>When his extreme hunger wakened him after several hours, he was still alone; but a little table, upon which was a good dinner, had been drawn up close to him, and, as he had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, he lost no time in beginning his meal, hoping that he might soon have an opportunity of thanking his considerate entertainer, whoever it might be. But no one appeared, and even after another long sleep, from which he awoke completely refreshed, there was no sign of anybody, though a fresh meal of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared upon the little table at his elbow. Being naturally timid, the silence began to terrify him, and he resolved to search once more through all the rooms; but it was of no use. Not even a servant was to be seen; there was no sign of life in the palace! He began to wonder what he should do, and to amuse himself by pretending that all the treasures he saw were his own, and considering how he would divide them among his children. Then he went down into the garden, and though it was winter everywhere else, here the sun shone, and the birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and the air was soft and sweet. The merchant, in ecstacies with all he saw and heard, said to himself:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='655'>"All this must be meant for me. I will go this minute and bring my children to share all these delights."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='656'>In spite of being so cold and weary when he reached the castle, he had taken his horse to the stable and fed it. Now he thought he would saddle it for his homeward journey, and he turned down the path which led to the stable. This path had a hedge of roses on each side of it, and the merchant thought he had never seen or smelt such exquisite flowers. They reminded him of his promise to Beauty, and he stopped and had just gathered one to take to her when he was startled by a strange noise behind him. Turning round, he saw a frightful Beast, which seemed to be very angry and said, in a terrible voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='657'>"Who told you that you might gather my roses? Was it not enough that I allowed you to be in my palace and was kind to you? This is the way you show your gratitude, by stealing my flowers! But your insolence shall not go unpunished." The merchant, terrified by these furious words, dropped the fatal rose, and, throwing himself on his knees, cried: "Pardon me, noble sir. I am truly grateful to you for your hospitality, which was so magnificent that I could not imagine that you would be offended by my taking such a little thing as a rose." But the Beast"s anger was not lessened by this speech.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='658'>"You are very ready with excuses and flattery," he cried; "but that will not save you from the death you deserve."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='659'>"Alas!" thought the merchant, "if my daughter could only know what danger her rose has brought me into!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='660'>And in despair he began to tell the Beast all his misfortunes, and the reason of his journey, not forgetting to mention Beauty"s request.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='661'>"A king"s ransom would hardly have procured all that my other daughters asked." he said: "but I thought that I might at least take Beauty her rose. I beg you to forgive me, for you see I meant no harm."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='662'>The Beast considered for a moment, and then he said, in a less furious tone:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='663'>"I will forgive you on one condition--that is, that you will give me one of your daughters."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='664'>"Ah!" cried the merchant, "if I were cruel enough to buy my own life at the expense of one of my children"s, what excuse could I invent to bring her here?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='665'>"No excuse would be necessary," answered the Beast. "If she comes at all she must come willingly. On no other condition will I have her. See if any one of them is courageous enough, and loves you well enough to come and save your life. You seem to be an honest man, so I will trust you to go home. I give you a month to see if either of your daughters will come back with you and stay here, to let you go free. If neither of them is willing, you must come alone, after bidding them good-by for ever, for then you will belong to me. And do not imagine that you can hide from me, for if you fail to keep your word I will come and fetch you!" added the Beast grimly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='666'>The merchant accepted this proposal, though he did not really think any of his daughters could be persuaded to come. He promised to return at the time appointed, and then, anxious to escape from the presence of the Beast, he asked permission to set off at once. But the Beast answered that he could not go until next day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='667'>"Then you will find a horse ready for you," he said. "Now go and eat your supper, and await my orders."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='668'>The poor merchant, more dead than alive, went back to his room, where the most delicious supper was already served on the little table which was drawn up before a blazing fire. But he was too terrified to eat, and only tasted a few of the dishes, for fear the Beast should be angry if he did not obey his orders. When he had finished he heard a great noise in the next room, which he knew meant that the Beast was coming. As he could do nothing to escape his visit, the only thing that remained was to seem as little afraid as possible; so when the Beast appeared and asked roughly if he had supped well, the merchant answered humbly that he had, thanks to his host"s kindness. Then the Beast warned him to remember their agreement, and to prepare his daughter exactly for what she had to expect.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='669'>"Do not get up to-morrow," he added, "until you see the sun and hear a golden bell ring. Then you will find your breakfast waiting for you here, and the horse you are to ride will be ready in the courtyard. He will also bring you back again when you come with your daughter a month hence. Farewell. Take a rose to Beauty, and remember your promise!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='670'>The merchant was only too glad when the Beast went away, and though he could not sleep for sadness, he lay down until the sun rose. Then, after a hasty breakfast, he went to gather Beauty"s rose, and mounted his horse, which carried him off so swiftly that in an instant he had lost sight of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;instant;beauty;thought;s;sight;breakfast' adjectives='hasty;gloomy' verbs='be;gather;mount;rise;stop;wrap;carry;have;lose;go' valence='5.68166666667' arousal='4.13291666667' dominance='5.44625'>the palace</entity>, and he was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts when it stopped before <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;instant;beauty;thought;s;sight;breakfast' adjectives='hasty;gloomy' verbs='be;gather;mount;rise;stop;wrap;carry;have;lose;go' valence='5.68166666667' arousal='4.13291666667' dominance='5.44625'>the door</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;instant;beauty;thought;s;sight;breakfast' adjectives='hasty;gloomy' verbs='be;gather;mount;rise;stop;wrap;carry;have;lose;go' valence='5.68166666667' arousal='4.13291666667' dominance='5.44625'>the cottage</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='671'>His sons and daughters, who had been very uneasy at his long absence, rushed to meet him, eager to know the result of his journey, which, seeing him mounted upon a splendid horse and wrapped in a rich mantle, they supposed to be favorable. He hid the truth from them at first, only saying sadly to Beauty as he gave her the rose:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='672'>"Here is what you asked me to bring you; you little know what it has cost."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='673'>But this excited their curiosity so greatly that presently he told them his adventures from beginning to end, and then they were all very unhappy. The girls lamented loudly over their lost hopes, and the sons declared that their father should not return to this terrible castle, and began to make plans for killing the Beast if it should come to fetch him. But he reminded them that he had promised to go back. Then the girls were very angry with Beauty, and said it was all her fault, and that if she had asked for something sensible this would never have happened, and complained bitterly that they should have to suffer for her folly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='674'>Poor Beauty, much distressed, said to them:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='675'>"I have, indeed, caused this misfortune, but I assure you I did it innocently. Who could have guessed that to ask for a rose in the middle of summer would cause so much misery? But as I did the mischief it is only just that I should suffer for it. I will therefore go back with my father to keep his promise."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='676'>At first nobody would hear of this arrangement, and her father and brothers, who loved her dearly, declared that nothing should make them let her go; but Beauty was firm. As the time drew near she divided all her little possessions between her sisters, and said good-by to everything she loved, and when the fatal day came she encouraged and cheered her father as they mounted together the horse which had brought him back. It seemed to fly rather than gallop, but so smoothly that Beauty was not frightened; indeed, she would have enjoyed the journey if she had not feared what might happen to her at the end of it. Her father still tried to persuade her to go back, but in vain. While they were talking the night fell, and then, to their great surprise, wonderful colored lights began to shine in all directions, and splendid fireworks blazed out before them; all the forest was illuminated by them, and even felt pleasantly warm, though it had been bitterly cold before. This lasted until they reached the avenue of orange trees, where were statues holding flaming torches, and when they got nearer to the palace they saw that it was illuminated from the roof to the ground, and music sounded softly from the courtyard. "The Beast must be very hungry," said Beauty, trying to laugh, "if he makes all this rejoicing over the arrival of his prey."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='677'>But, in spite of her anxiety, she could not help admiring all the wonderful things she saw.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='678'>The horse stopped at the foot of the flight of steps leading to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;flight;room;burning;fire;father;step;supper;foot' adjectives='little;splendid;delicious' verbs='be;lead;stop;spread;dismount;have;find' valence='5.74208333333' arousal='3.90958333333' dominance='5.57583333333'>the terrace</entity>, and when they had dismounted her father led her to the little room he had been in before, where they found a splendid fire burning, and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;flight;room;burning;fire;father;step;supper;foot' adjectives='little;splendid;delicious' verbs='be;lead;stop;spread;dismount;have;find' valence='5.74208333333' arousal='3.90958333333' dominance='5.57583333333'>the table</entity> daintily spread with a delicious supper.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='679'>The merchant knew that this was meant for them, and Beauty, who was rather less frightened now that she had passed through so many rooms and seen nothing of the Beast, was quite willing to begin, for her long ride had made her very hungry. But they had hardly finished their meal when the noise of the Beast"s footsteps was heard approaching, and Beauty clung to her father in terror, which became all the greater when she saw how frightened he was. But when the Beast really appeared, though she trembled at the sight of him, she made a great effort to hide her terror, and saluted him respectfully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='680'>This evidently pleased the Beast. After looking at her he said, in a tone that might have struck terror into the boldest heart, though he did not seem to be angry:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='681'>"Good-evening, old man. Good-evening, Beauty."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='682'>The merchant was too terrified to reply, but Beauty answered sweetly: "Good-evening, Beast."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='683'>"Have you come willingly?" asked the Beast. "Will you be content to stay here when your father goes away?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='684'>Beauty answered bravely that she was quite prepared to stay.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='685'>"I am pleased with you," said the Beast. "As you have come of your own accord, you may stay. As for you, old man," he added, turning to the merchant, "at sunrise to-morrow you will take your departure. When the bell rings get up quickly and eat your breakfast, and you will find the same horse waiting to take you home; but remember that you must never expect to see my palace again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='686'>Then turning to Beauty, he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='687'>"Take your father into the next room, and help him to choose everything you think your brothers and sisters would like to have. You will find two traveling-trunks there; fill them as full as you can. It is only just that you should send them something very precious as a remembrance of yourself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='688'>Then he went away, after saying, "Good-by, Beauty; good-by, old man"; and though Beauty was beginning to think with great dismay of her father"s departure, she was afraid to disobey the Beast"s orders; and they went into the next room, which had shelves and cupboards all round it. They were greatly surprised at the riches it contained. There were splendid dresses fit for a queen, with all the ornaments that were to be worn with them; and when Beauty opened the cupboards she was quite dazzled by the gorgeous jewels that lay in heaps upon every shelf. After choosing a vast quantity, which she divided between her sisters--for she had made a heap of the wonderful dresses for each of them--she opened the last chest, which was full of gold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='689'>"I think, father," she said, "that, as the gold will be more useful to you, we had better take out the other things again, and fill the trunks with it." So they did this; but the more they put in the more room there seemed to be, and at last they put back all the jewels and dresses they had taken out, and Beauty even added as many more of the jewels as she could carry at once; and then the trunks were not too full, but they were so heavy that an elephant could not have carried them!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='690'>"The Beast was mocking us," cried the merchant; "he must have pretended to give us all these things, knowing that I could not carry them away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='691'>"Let us wait and see," answered Beauty. "I cannot believe that he meant to deceive us. All we can do is to fasten them up and leave them ready."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='692'>So they did this and returned to the little room, where, to their astonishment, they found breakfast ready. The merchant ate his with a good appetite, as the Beast"s generosity made him believe that he might perhaps venture to come back soon and see Beauty. But she felt sure that her father was leaving her for ever, so she was very sad when the bell rang sharply for the second time, and warned them that the time had come for them to part. They went down into the courtyard, where two horses were waiting, one loaded with the two trunks, the other for him to ride. They were pawing the ground in their impatience to start, and the merchant was forced to bid Beauty a hasty farewell; and as soon as he was mounted he went off at such a pace that she lost sight of him in an instant. Then Beauty began to cry, and wandered sadly back to her own room. But she soon found that she was very sleepy, and as she had nothing better to do she lay down and instantly fell asleep. And then she dreamed that she was walking by a brook bordered with trees, and lamenting her sad fate, when a young prince, handsomer than anyone she had ever seen, and with a voice that went straight to her heart, came and said to her, "Ah, Beauty! you are not so unfortunate as you suppose. Here you will be rewarded for all you have suffered elsewhere. Your every wish shall be gratified. Only try to find me out, no matter how I may be disguised, as I love you dearly, and in making me happy you will find your own happiness. Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we shall have nothing left to wish for."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='693'>"What can I do, Prince, to make you happy?" said Beauty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='694'>"Only be grateful," he answered, "and do not trust too much to your eyes. And, above all, do not desert me until you have saved me from my cruel misery."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='695'>After this she thought she found herself in a room with a stately and beautiful lady, who said to her:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='696'>"Dear Beauty, try not to regret all you have left behind you, for you are destined to a better fate. Only do not let yourself be deceived by appearances."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='697'>Beauty found her dreams so interesting that she was in no hurry to awake, but presently the clock roused her by calling her name softly twelve times, and then she got up and found her dressing-table set out with everything she could possibly want; and when her toilet was finished she found dinner was waiting in the room next to hers. But dinner does not take very long when you are all by yourself, and very soon she sat down cosily in the corner of a sofa, and began to think about the charming <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='corner;dinner;dream;sofa' adjectives='charming' verbs='do;begin;sit;see;take;have;be;think' valence='5.99266666667' arousal='3.89866666667' dominance='5.67933333333'>Prince</entity> she had seen in her dream.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='698'>"He said I could make him happy," said Beauty to herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='699'>"It seems, then, that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How can I set him free? I wonder why they both told me not to trust to appearances? I don"t understand it. But, after all, it was only a dream, so why should I trouble myself about it? I had better go and find something to do to amuse myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='700'>So she got up and began to explore some of the many rooms of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='room' adjectives='many' verbs='begin;explore;get' valence='6.256' arousal='3.744' dominance='5.688'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='701'>The first she entered was lined with mirrors, and Beauty saw herself reflected on every side, and thought she had never seen such a charming room. Then a bracelet which was hanging from a chandelier caught her eye, and on taking it down she was greatly surprised to find that it held a portrait of her unknown admirer, just as she had seen him in her dream. With great delight she slipped the bracelet on her arm, and went on into a gallery of pictures, where she soon found a portrait of the same handsome Prince, as large as life, and so well painted that as she studied it he seemed to smile kindly at her. Tearing herself away from the portrait at last, she passed through into a room which contained every musical instrument under the sun, and here she amused herself for a long while in trying some of them, and singing until she was tired. The next room was a library, and she saw everything she had ever wanted to read, as well as everything she had read, and it seemed to her that a whole lifetime would not be enough to even read the names of the books, there were so many. By this time it was growing dusk, and wax candles in diamond and ruby candlesticks were beginning to light themselves in every room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='702'>Beauty found her supper served just at the time she preferred to have it, but she did not see anyone or hear a sound, and, though her father had warned her that she would be alone, she began to find it rather dull.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='703'>But presently she heard the Beast coming, and wondered tremblingly if he meant to eat her up now.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='704'>However, as he did not seem at all ferocious, and only said gruffly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='705'>"Good-evening, Beauty," she answered cheerfully and managed to conceal her terror. Then the Beast asked her how she had been amusing herself, and she told him all the rooms she had seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='706'>Then he asked if she thought she could be happy in his palace; and Beauty answered that everything was so beautiful that she would be very hard to please if she could not be happy. And after about an hour"s talk Beauty began to think that the Beast was not nearly so terrible as she had supposed at first. Then he got up to leave her, and said in his gruff voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='707'>"Do you love me, Beauty? Will you marry me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='708'>"Oh! what shall I say?" cried Beauty, for she was afraid to make the Beast angry by refusing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='709'>"Say "yes" or "no" without fear," he replied.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='710'>"Oh! no, Beast," said Beauty hastily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='711'>"Since you will not, good-night, Beauty," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='712'>And she answered, "Good-night, Beast," very glad to find that her refusal had not provoked him. And after he was gone she was very soon in bed and asleep, and dreaming of her unknown Prince. She thought he came and said to her:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='713'>"Ah, Beauty! why are you so unkind to me? I fear I am fated to be unhappy for many a long day still."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='715'>This morning she decided to amuse herself in the garden, for the sun shone, and all the fountains were playing; but she was astonished to find that every place was familiar to her, and presently she came to the brook where the myrtle trees were growing where she had first met the Prince in her dream, and that made her think more than ever that he must be kept a prisoner by the Beast. When she was tired she went back to the palace, and found a new room full of materials for every kind of work--ribbons to make into bows, and silks to work into flowers. Then there was an aviary full of rare birds, which were so tame that they flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her, and perched upon her shoulders and her head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='716'>"Pretty little creatures," she said, "how I wish that your cage was nearer to my room, that I might often hear you sing!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='717'>So saying she opened a door, and found, to her delight, that it led into her own room, though she had thought it was quite the other side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='delight;door;room;side' adjectives='own;other' verbs='be;lead;think;say;have;open;find' valence='5.99142857143' arousal='3.93142857143' dominance='5.94285714286'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='718'>There were more birds in a room farther on, parrots and cockatoos that could talk, and they greeted Beauty by name; indeed, she found them so entertaining that she took one or two back to her room, and they talked to her while she was at supper; after which the Beast paid her his usual visit, and asked her the same questions as before, and then with a gruff "good-night" he took his departure, and Beauty went to bed to dream of her mysterious Prince. The days passed swiftly in different amusements, and after a while Beauty found out another strange thing in the palace, which often pleased her when she was tired of being alone. There was one room which she had not noticed particularly; it was empty, except that under each of the windows stood a very comfortable chair; and the first time she had looked out of the window it had seemed to her that a black curtain prevented her from seeing anything outside. But the second time she went into the room, happening to be tired, she sat down in one of the chairs, when instantly the curtain was rolled aside, and a most amusing pantomime was acted before her; there were dances, and colored lights, and music, and pretty dresses, and it was all so gay that Beauty was in ecstacies. After that she tried the other seven windows in turn, and there was some new and surprising entertainment to be seen from each of them, so that Beauty never could feel lonely any more. Every evening after supper the Beast came to see her, and always before saying good-night asked her in his terrible voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='719'>"Beauty, will you marry me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='720'>And it seemed to Beauty, now she understood him better, that when she said, "No, Beast," he went away quite sad. But her happy dreams of the handsome young <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;eye;appearance;beast;thing;dream;guide' adjectives='poor;perplexing;many;young;only;other;happy;handsome' verbs='be;disturb;forget;make;distrust;let;understand;tell;consider' valence='5.7376' arousal='4.0664' dominance='5.3912'>Prince</entity> soon made her forget the poor Beast, and the only thing that at all disturbed her was to be constantly told to distrust appearances, to let her heart guide her, and not her eyes, and many other equally perplexing things, which, consider as she would, she could not understand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='721'>So everything went on for a long time, until at last, happy as she was, Beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and sisters; and one night, seeing her look very sad, the Beast asked her what was the matter. Beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him. Now she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful voice. So she answered that she was longing to see her home once more. Upon hearing this the Beast seemed sadly distressed, and cried miserably.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='722'>"Ah! Beauty, have you the heart to desert an unhappy Beast like this? What more do you want to make you happy? Is it because you hate me that you want to escape?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='723'>"No, dear Beast," answered Beauty softly, "I do not hate you, and I should be very sorry never to see you any more, but I long to see my father again. Only let me go for two months, and I promise to come back to you and stay for the rest of my life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='724'>The Beast, who had been sighing dolefully while she spoke, now replied:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='725'>"I cannot refuse you anything you ask, even though it should cost me my life. Take the four boxes you will find in the room next to your own, and fill them with everything you wish to take with you. But remember your promise and come back when the two months are over, or you may have cause to repent it, for if you do not come in good time you will find your faithful Beast dead. You will not need any chariot to bring you back. Only say good-by to all your brothers and sisters the night before you come away, and when you have gone to bed turn this ring round upon your finger and say firmly: "I wish to go back to my palace and see my Beast again." Good-night, Beauty. Fear nothing, sleep peacefully, and before long you shall see your father once more."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='726'>As soon as Beauty was alone she hastened to fill the boxes with all the rare and precious things she saw about her, and only when she was tired of heaping things into them did they seem to be full.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='727'>Then she went to bed, but could hardly sleep for joy. And when at last she did begin to dream of her beloved <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='dream;bank' adjectives='weary;last;grassy;beloved;sad' verbs='do;begin;be;stretch;grieve;see' valence='5.476' arousal='4.04266666667' dominance='5.33'>Prince</entity> she was grieved to see him stretched upon a grassy bank, sad and weary, and hardly like himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='728'>"What is the matter?" she cried.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='729'>He looked at her reproachfully, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='730'>"How can you ask me, cruel one? Are you not leaving me to my death perhaps?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='731'>"Ah! don"t be so sorrowful," cried Beauty; "I am only going to assure my father that I am safe and happy. I have promised the Beast faithfully that I will come back, and he would die of grief if I did not keep my word!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='732'>"What would that matter to you?" said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;care' valence='6.225' arousal='4.015' dominance='5.9425'>Prince</entity> "Surely you would not care?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='733'>"Indeed, I should be ungrateful if I did not care for such a kind Beast," cried Beauty indignantly. "I would die to save him from pain. I assure you it is not his fault that he is so ugly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='734'>Just then a strange sound woke her--someone was speaking not very far away; and opening her eyes she found herself in a room she had never seen before, which was certainly not nearly so splendid as those she was used to in the Beast"s palace. Where could she be? She got up and dressed hastily, and then saw that the boxes she had packed the night before were all in the room. While she was wondering by what magic the Beast had transported them and herself to this strange place she suddenly heard her father"s voice, and rushed out and greeted him joyfully. Her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance, as they had never expected to see her again, and there was no end to the questions they asked her. She had also much to hear about what had happened to them while she was away, and of her father"s journey home. But when they heard that she had only come to be with them for a short time, and then must go back to the Beast"s palace for ever, they lamented loudly. Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams, and why the Prince constantly begged her not to trust to appearances. After much consideration, he answered: "You tell me yourself that the Beast, frightful as he is, loves you dearly, and deserves your love and gratitude for his gentleness and kindness; I think the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='gratitude;gentleness;spite;love;beast;ugliness;consideration;kindness' adjectives='frightful;much' verbs='be;love;do;deserve;tell;understand;wish;answer;reward;think;mean' valence='5.77652173913' arousal='4.41' dominance='5.51260869565'>Prince</entity> must mean you to understand that you ought to reward him by doing as he wishes you to, in spite of his ugliness."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='735'>Beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable; still, when she thought of her dear Prince who was so handsome, she did not feel at all inclined to marry the Beast. At any rate, for two months she need not decide, but could enjoy herself with her sisters. But though they were rich now, and lived in town again, and had plenty of acquaintances, Beauty found that nothing amused her very much; and she often thought of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='town;acquaintance;beauty;plenty;nothing;home' adjectives='sad;rich;happy' verbs='be;feel;amuse;think;live;have;dream;find' valence='6.40555555556' arousal='4.29722222222' dominance='5.73555555556'>the palace</entity>, where she was so happy, especially as at home she never once dreamed of her dear <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='town;acquaintance;beauty;plenty;nothing;home' adjectives='sad;rich;happy' verbs='be;feel;amuse;think;live;have;dream;find' valence='6.40555555556' arousal='4.29722222222' dominance='5.73555555556'>Prince</entity>, and she felt quite sad without him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='736'>Then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her, and even found her rather in the way, so she would not have been sorry when the two months were over but for her father and brothers, who begged her to stay, and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure that she had not the courage to say good-by to them. Every day when she got up she meant to say it at night, and when night came she put it off again, until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her mind. She thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens, when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave, and running quickly to see what could be the matter, she found the Beast stretched out upon his side, apparently dying. He reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress, and at the same moment a stately lady appeared, and said very gravely:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='737'>"Ah! Beauty, you are only just in time to save his life. See what happens when people do not keep their promises! If you had delayed one day more, you would have found him dead."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='738'>Beauty was so terrified by this dream that the next morning she announced her intention of going back at once, and that very night she said good-by to her father and all her brothers and sisters, and as soon as she was in bed she turned her ring round upon her finger, and said firmly, "I wish to go back to my palace and see my Beast again," as she had been told to do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='739'>Then she fell asleep instantly, and only woke up to hear the clock saying "Beauty, Beauty" twelve times in its musical voice, which told her at once that she was really in the palace once more. Everything was just as before, and her birds were so glad to see her! But Beauty thought she had never known such a long day, for she was so anxious to see the Beast again that she felt as if suppertime would never come.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='740'>But when it did come and no Beast appeared she was really frightened; so, after listening and waiting for a long time, she ran down into the garden to search for him. Up and down the paths and avenues ran poor Beauty, calling him in vain, for no one answered, and not a trace of him could she find; until at last, quite tired, she stopped for a minute"s rest, and saw that she was standing opposite the shady path she had seen in her dream. She rushed down it, and, sure enough, there was the cave, and in it lay the Beast--asleep, as Beauty thought. Quite glad to have found him, she ran up and stroked his head, but, to her horror, he did not move or open his eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='741'>"Oh! he is dead; and it is all my fault," said Beauty, crying bitterly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='742'>But then, looking at him again, she fancied he still breathed, and, hastily fetching some water from the nearest fountain, she sprinkled it over his face, and, to her great delight, he began to revive.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='743'>"Oh! Beast, how you frightened me!" she cried. "I never knew how much I loved you until just now, when I feared I was too late to save your life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='744'>"Can you really love such an ugly creature as I am?" said the Beast faintly. "Ah! Beauty, you only came just in time. I was dying because I thought you had forgotten your promise. But go back now and rest, I shall see you again by and by."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='745'>Beauty, who had half expected that he would be angry with her, was reassured by his gentle voice, and went back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beauty;supper;father;beast;time;voice' adjectives='gentle;angry;glad;usual' verbs='enjoy;be;await;reassure;ask;see;expect;have;go;come;spend;talk' valence='6.05935483871' arousal='3.86935483871' dominance='5.67741935484'>the palace</entity>, where supper was awaiting her; and afterward the Beast came in as usual, and talked about the time she had spent with her father, asking if she had enjoyed herself, and if they had all been very glad to see her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='746'>Beauty answered politely, and quite enjoyed telling him all that had happened to her. And when at last the time came for him to go, and he asked, as he had so often asked before, "Beauty, will you marry me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='747'>She answered softly, "Yes, dear Beast."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='748'>As she spoke a blaze of light sprang up before the windows of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fire-fly;tree;gun;long;bride;window;firework;blaze;letter' adjectives='orange;light' verbs='be;spring;make;crackle;live;write;bang;speak' valence='6.09333333333' arousal='4.52857142857' dominance='5.43142857143'>the palace</entity>; fireworks crackled and guns banged, and across <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fire-fly;tree;gun;long;bride;window;firework;blaze;letter' adjectives='orange;light' verbs='be;spring;make;crackle;live;write;bang;speak' valence='6.09333333333' arousal='4.52857142857' dominance='5.43142857143'>the avenue</entity> of orange trees, in letters all made of fire-flies, was written: "Long live the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fire-fly;tree;gun;long;bride;window;firework;blaze;letter' adjectives='orange;light' verbs='be;spring;make;crackle;live;write;bang;speak' valence='6.09333333333' arousal='4.52857142857' dominance='5.43142857143'>Prince</entity> and his Bride."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='749'>Turning to ask the Beast what it could all mean, Beauty found that he had disappeared, and in his place stood her long-loved Prince! At the same moment the wheels of a chariot were heard upon the terrace, and two ladies entered the room. One of them Beauty recognized as the stately lady she had seen in her dreams; the other was also so grand and queenly that Beauty hardly knew which to greet first.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='750'>But the one she already knew said to her companion:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='758'>THE MASTER-MAID</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='759'>Once upon a time there was a king who had many sons. I do not exactly know how many there were, but the youngest of them could not stay quietly at home, and was determined to go out into the world and try his luck, and after a long time the King was forced to give him leave to go. When he had traveled about for several days, he came to a giant"s house, and hired himself to the giant as a servant. In the morning the giant had to go out to pasture his goats, and as he was leaving the house he told the King"s son that he must clean out the stable. "And after you have done that," he said, "you need not do any more work to-day, for you have come to a kind master, and that you shall find. But what I set you to do must be done both well and thoroughly, and you must on no account go into any of the rooms which lead out of the room in which you slept last night. If you do, I will take your life."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='760'>"Well to be sure, he is an easy master!" said the Prince to himself as he walked up and down the room humming and singing, for he thought there would be plenty of time left to clean out the stable; "but it would be amusing to steal a glance into his other rooms as well," thought the Prince, "for there must be something that he is afraid of my seeing, as I am not allowed to enter them." So he went into the first room. A cauldron was hanging from the walls; it was boiling, but the Prince could see no fire under it. "I wonder what is inside it," he thought, and dipped a lock of his hair in, and the hair became just as if it were all made of copper. "That"s a nice kind of soup. If anyone were to taste that his throat would be gilded," said the youth, and then he went into the next chamber. There, too, a cauldron was hanging from the wall, bubbling and boiling, but there was no fire under this either. "I will just try what this is like too," said the Prince, thrusting another lock of his hair into it, and it came out silvered over. "Such costly soup is not to be had in my father"s palace," said the Prince; "but everything depends on how it tastes," and then he went into the third room. There, too, a cauldron was hanging from the wall, boiling, exactly the same as in the two other rooms, and the Prince took pleasure in trying this also, so he dipped a lock of hair in, and it came out so brightly gilded that it shone again. "Some talk about going from bad to worse," said the Prince; "but this is better and better. If he boils gold here, what can he boil in there?" He was determined to see, and went through the door into the fourth room. No cauldron was to be seen there, but on a bench someone was seated who was like a king"s daughter, but, whosoever she was, she was so beautiful that never in the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;life;someone;daughter;whosoever;cauldron;bench;s' adjectives='beautiful;equal' verbs='be;see;have;seat' valence='5.97739130435' arousal='4.19956521739' dominance='5.54043478261'>Prince</entity>"s life had he seen her equal.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='761'>"Oh! in heaven"s name what are you doing here?" said she who sat upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;sit' valence='5.74333333333' arousal='3.69333333333' dominance='6.25'>the bench</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='765'>"Yes, but how will you be able to do that?" she asked again. "If you clean it out as other people do, ten pitchforksful will come in for every one you throw out.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='766'>"Yes, I will attend to that," said the Prince, and stayed sitting where he was the whole day, for it was soon settled between them that they would marry each other, he and the King"s daughter; so the first day of his service with the giant did not seem long to him. But when evening was drawing near she said that it would now be better for him to clean out the stable before the giant came home. When he got there he had a fancy to try if what she had said were true, so he began to work in the same way that he had seen the stable-boys doing in his father"s stables, but he soon saw that he must give up that, for when he had worked a very short time he had scarcely any room left to stand. So he did what the Princess had taught him, turned the pitchfork round, and worked with the handle, and in the twinkling of an eye the stable was as clean as if it had been scoured.

He said he would bear this in mind, and then he again sat in there the whole day by the Master-maid, and they chatted and talked of one thing and another, but the first thing and the last now was, how happy and delightful it would be if they could but marry each other, and get safely away from the giant; and the Prince would have forgotten both the mountain-side and the horse if the Master-maid had not reminded him of them as evening drew near, and said that now it would be better if he went to fetch the horse before the giant came. So he did this, and took the bridle which was hanging on a crook, and strode up the mountain-side, and it was not long before he met with the horse, and fire and red flames streamed forth out of its nostrils. But the youth carefully watched his opportunity, and just as it was rushing at him with open jaws he threw the bit straight into its mouth, and the horse stood as quiet as a young lamb, and there was no difficulty at all in getting it home to the stable.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='813'>"Ah! well, she has just stolen out for a little," thought the giant, and he took a spoon, and went off to the cauldron to have a taste; but there was nothing in it but shoe-soles, and rags, and such trumpery as that, and all was boiled up together, so that he could not tell whether it was porridge or milk pottage. When he saw this, he understood what had happened, and fell into such a rage that he hardly knew what he was doing. Away he went after the Prince and the Master-maid so fast that the wind whistled behind him, and it was not long before he came to the water, but he could not get over it. "Well, well, I will soon find a cure for that; I have only to call my river-sucker," said the giant, and he did call him. So his river-sucker came and lay down, and drank one, two, three draughts, and with that the water in the sea fell so low that the giant saw the Master-maid and the Prince out on the sea in their ship. "Now you must throw out the lump of salt," said the Master-maid, and the Prince did so, and it grew up into such a great high mountain right across the sea that the giant could not come over it, and the river-sucker could not drink any more water. "Well, well, I will soon find a cure for that," said the giant, so he called to his hill-borer to come and bore through the mountain so that the river-sucker might be able to drink up the water again. But just as the hole was made, and the river-sucker was beginning to drink, the Master-maid told the Prince to throw one or two drops out of the flask, and when he did this the sea instantly became full of water again, and before the river-sucker could take one drink they reached the land and were in safety.

"But when you get there you must not even give yourself time to greet anyone, but go straight into the stable, and take the horses, and put them in the coach, and drive back as quickly as you can. For they will all come round about you; but you must behave just as if you did not see them, and on no account must you taste anything, for if you do it will cause great misery both to you and to me," said she; and this he promised.</paragraph>

When they saw that they could not by any means prevail on him to go in with them, they came out to him with meat and drink, and the best of everything that they had prepared for the wedding; but the Prince refused to touch anything, and would do nothing but put the horses in as quickly as he could. At last, however, the bride"s sister rolled an apple across the yard to him, and said: "As you won"t eat anything else, you may like to take a bite of that, for you must be both hungry and thirsty after your long journey." And he took up the apple and bit a piece out of it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='819'>The Master-maid sat by the sea-shore for a long, long time, waiting for the Prince, but no Prince came. So she went away, and when she had walked a short distance she came to a little hut which stood all alone in a small wood, hard by the King"s palace. She entered it and asked if she might be allowed to stay there. The hut belonged to an old crone, who was also an ill-tempered and malicious troll. At first she would not let the Master-maid remain with her; but at last, after a long time, by means of good words and good payment, she obtained leave. But the hut was as dirty and black inside as a pigsty, so the Master-maid said that she would smarten it up a little, that it might look a little more like what other people"s houses looked inside. The old crone did not like this either. She scowled, and was very cross, but the Master-maid did not trouble herself about that. She took out her chest of gold, and flung a handful of it or so into the fire, and the gold boiled up and poured out over the whole of the hut, until every part of it both inside and out was gilded. But when the gold began to bubble up the old hag grew so terrified that she fled as if the Evil One himself were pursuing her, and she did not remember to stoop down as she went through the doorway, and so she split her head and died. Next morning the sheriff came traveling by there. He was greatly astonished when he saw the gold hut shining and glittering there in the copse, and he was still more astonished when he went in and caught sight of the beautiful young maiden who was sitting there; he fell in love with her at once, and straightway on the spot he begged her, both prettily and kindly, to marry him.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='826'>"Then you may hold the shovel, and the shovel you, and pour red-hot coals over you, till day dawns," said the Master-maid. So the sheriff had to stand there the whole night and pour red-hot coals over himself, and, no matter how much he cried and begged and entreated, the red-hot coals did not grow the colder for that. When the day began to dawn, and he had power to throw down the shovel, he did not stay long where he was, but ran away as fast as he possibly could; and everyone who met him stared and looked after him, for he was flying as if he were mad, and he could not have looked worse if he had been both flayed and tanned, and everyone wondered where he had been, but for very shame he would tell nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='827'>The next day the attorney came riding by the place where the Master-maid dwelt. He saw how brightly the hut shone and gleamed through the wood, and he too went into it to see who lived there, and when he entered and saw the beautiful young maiden he fell even more in love with her than the sheriff had done, and began to woo her at once. So the Master-maid asked him, as she had asked the sheriff, if he had a great deal of money, and the attorney said he was not ill off for that, and would at once go home to get it; and at night he came with a great big sack of money--this time it was a four-bushel sack--and set it on the bench by the Master-maid.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='833'>What a dance the attorney had that night! He had never had such a waltz before, and he never wished to have such a dance again. Sometimes he was in front of the door, and sometimes the door was in front of him, and it went from one side of the porch to the other, till the attorney was well-nigh beaten to death. At first he began to abuse the Master-maid, and then to beg and pray, but <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='break;anything' adjectives='' verbs='do;begin;be;pray;beg;keep;abuse;care' valence='5.66916666667' arousal='3.88166666667' dominance='5.42166666667'>the door</entity> did not care for anything but keeping him where he was till break of day.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='835'>On the third day the bailiff came by, and he too saw the gold house in the little wood, and he too felt that he must go and see who lived there; and when he caught sight of the Master-maid he became so much in love with her that he wooed her almost before he greeted her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='836'>The Master-maid answered him as she had answered the other two, that if he had a great deal of money, she would have him. "So far as that is concerned, I am not ill off," said the bailiff; so he was at once told to go home and fetch it, and this he did. At night he came back, and he had a still larger sack of money with him than the attorney had brought; it must have been at least six bushels, and he set it down on the bench. So it was settled that he was to have the Master-maid. But hardly had they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring in the calf, and must go out to put it in the byre.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='837'>"No, indeed, you shall not do that," said the bailiff; "I am the one to do that." And, big and fat as he was, he went out as briskly as a boy.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='840'>"Then may you hold the calf"s tail, and the calf"s tail hold you, and may you go round the world together till day dawns!" said the Master-maid. So the bailiff had to bestir himself, for the calf went over rough and smooth, over hill and dale, and, the more the bailiff cried and screamed, the faster the calf went. When daylight began to appear, the bailiff was half dead; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf"s tail, that he forgot the sack of money and all else. He walked now slowly--more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done, but, the slower he went, the more time had everyone to stare and look at him; and they used it too, and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='841'>On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King"s palace, and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride, and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister. But when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the palace one of the trace-pins broke, and, though they made one, two, and three to put in its place, that did not help them, for each broke in turn, no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of. This went on for a long time, and they could not get away from the palace, so they were all in great trouble. Then the sheriff said (for he too had been bidden to the wedding at Court): "Yonder away in the thicket dwells a maiden, and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that she uses to make up her fire I know very well that it will hold fast." So they sent off a messenger to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='trace-pin;loan;messenger;shovel-handle;sheriff' adjectives='' verbs='be;refuse;beg;send;have;snap;speak' valence='5.19' arousal='3.91529411765' dominance='5.03235294118'>the thicket</entity>, and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused; so now they had a trace-pin which would not snap in two.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='842'>But all at once, just as they were starting, the bottom of the coach fell in pieces. They made a new bottom as fast as they could, but, no matter how they nailed it together, or what kind of wood they used, no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again, so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin. Then the attorney said, for he too was at the wedding in the palace: "Away there in the thicket dwells a maiden, and if you could but get her to lend you one-half of her porch-door I am certain that it will hold together." So they again sent a messenger to the thicket, and begged so prettily for the loan of the gilded porch-door of which the attorney had told them that they got it at once. They were just setting out again, but now the horses were not able to draw the coach. They had six horses already, and now they put in eight, and then ten, and then twelve, but the more they put in, and the more the coachman whipped them, the less good it did; and the coach never stirred from the spot. It was already beginning to be late in the day, and to church they must and would go, so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress. Then the bailiff spoke up and said: "Out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl, and if you could but get her to lend you her calf I know it could draw the coach, even if it were as heavy as a mountain." They all thought that it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf, but there was nothing else for it but to send a messenger once more, and beg as prettily as they could, on behalf of the King, that she would let them have the loan of the calf that the bailiff had told them about. The Master-maid let them have it immediately--this time also she would not say "no."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='843'>Then they harnessed the calf to see if the coach would move; and away it went, over rough and smooth, over stock and stone, so that they could scarcely breathe, and sometimes they were on the ground, and sometimes up in the air; and when they came to the church the coach began to go round and round like a spinning-wheel, and it was with the utmost difficulty and danger that they were able to get out of the coach and into the church.

"Bless me!" said the old woman as one thing after another appeared; and she wanted to know where her husband had got <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thing;woman;husband' adjectives='old' verbs='appear;want;get;say;know;have;tell' valence='5.845' arousal='3.71642857143' dominance='5.51857142857'>the mill</entity> from, but he would not tell her that.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='871'>Now when the rich brother saw all that there was at the banquet and in the house, he was both vexed and angry, for he grudged everything his brother had.

"But, for heaven"s sake, tell me where you got your riches from," said he to his brother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='872'>"From behind the door," said he who owned the mill, for he did not choose to satisfy his brother on that point; but later in the evening, when he had taken a drop too much, he could not refrain from telling how he had come by the hand-mill. "There you see what has brought me all my wealth!" said he, and brought out the mill, and made it grind first one thing and then another. When the brother saw that, he insisted on having the mill, and after a great deal of persuasion got it; but he had to give three hundred dollars for it, and the poor brother was to keep it till the haymaking was over, for he thought: "If I keep it as long as that, I can make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long year." During that time you may imagine that the mill did not grow rusty, and when hay-harvest came the rich brother got it, but the other had taken good care not to teach him how to stop it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='874'>So the mill began to grind herrings and milk pottage, and first all the dishes and tubs were filled, and then it came out all over the kitchen-floor. The man twisted and turned it, and did all he could to make the mill stop, but, howsoever he turned it and screwed it, the mill went on grinding, and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the man was like to be drowned. So he threw open the parlor door, but it was not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too, and it was with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the door-latch. When he got the door open, he did not stay long in the room, but ran out, and the herrings and pottage came after him, and it streamed out over both farm and field. Now the old woman, who was out spreading the hay, began to think dinner was long in coming, and said to the women and the mowers: "Though the master does not call us home, we may as well go. It may be that he finds he is not good at making pottage and I should do well to help him." So they began to straggle homeward, but when they had got a little way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread, all pouring forth and winding about one over the other, and the man himself in front of the flood. "Would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs! Take care that you are not drowned in the pottage!" he cried as he went by them as if Mischief were at his heels, down to where his brother dwelt. Then he begged him, for God"s sake, to take the mill back again, and that in an instant, for, said he: "If it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage." But the brother would not take it until the other paid him three hundred dollars, and that he was obliged to do. Now the poor brother had both the money and the mill again. So it was not long before he had a farmhouse much finer than that in which his brother lived, but the mill ground him so much money that he covered it with plates of gold; and the farmhouse lay close by the sea-shore, so it shone and glittered far out to sea. Everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man in the gold farmhouse, and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill, for the report of it spread far and wide, and there was no one who had not heard tell of it.</paragraph>

There lies the mill at the bottom of the sea, and still, day by day, it grinds on; and that is why the sea is salt.(1)</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='998'>So he sent for them all, and, after speaking to them kindly, he added:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='999'>"You will quite agree with me, my dear children, that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did. I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects, therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown; but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me. Now, as I think of retiring into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='age;company;regard;dog' adjectives='beautiful;little;good;lively;faithful' verbs='be;retire;bring;succeed;promise;seem;think' valence='6.143' arousal='4.40133333333' dominance='5.68566666667'>the country</entity>, it seems to me that a pretty, lively, faithful little dog would be very good company for me; so, without any regard for your ages, I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1000'>The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father"s sudden fancy for a little dog, but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would not otherwise have had of being king, and as the eldest was too polite to make any objection, they accepted the commission with pleasure. They bade farewell to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='place;stone;farewell;silver;dog' adjectives='precious;little;same' verbs='appoint;give;bid;bring;see;have;pass;meet;present' valence='5.91952380952' arousal='4.06476190476' dominance='5.82285714286'>the King</entity>, who gave them presents of silver and precious stones, and appointed to meet them at the same hour, in the same place, after a year had passed, to see the little dogs they had brought for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1001'>Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city, accompanied by all their particular friends, to whom they gave a grand banquet, and the three brothers promised to be friends always, to share whatever good fortune befell them, and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy; and so they set out, agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time, to present themselves before the King together. Each one took a different road, and the two eldest met with many adventures; but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear. He was young, and gay, and handsome, and knew everything that a prince ought to know; and as for his courage, there was simply no end to it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1002'>Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs--big and little, greyhounds, mastiffs, spaniels, and lapdogs. As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier, and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one, as, being alone, he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him. He journeyed from day to day, not knowing where he was going, until at last, just at nightfall, he reached a great, gloomy forest. He did not know his way, and, to make matters worse, it began to thunder, and the rain poured down. He took the first path he could find, and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light, and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night. At length, guided by the light, he reached the door of the most splendid castle he could have imagined. This door was of gold covered with carbuncles, and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest. The walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors, and the Prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them; but as he was terribly wet, and the rain still fell in torrents, he could not stay to look about any more, but came back to the golden door. There he saw a deer"s foot hanging by a chain of diamonds, and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1003'>"They must feel very secure against robbers," he said to himself. "What is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles, and making himself rich for life?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1004'>He pulled the deer"s foot, and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open, but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air, each holding a torch. He was so much surprised that he stood quite still, until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands, so that, though he was somewhat uneasy, he could not help going on. With his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, while two lovely voices sang:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1005'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1006'>"The hands you see floating above</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1007'>Will swiftly your bidding obey;</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1008'>If your heart dreads not conquering Love,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1009'>In this place you may fearlessly stay."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1010'>The Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way, so, guided by the mysterious hands, he went toward a door of coral, which opened of its own accord, and he found himself in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl, out of which opened a number of other rooms, glittering with thousands of lights, and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered. After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped, and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner; at the same moment the fire lighted itself, and the pretty, soft, clever hands took off the Prince"s wet, muddy clothes, and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs, all embroidered with gold and emeralds. He could not help admiring everything he saw, and the deft way in which the hands waited on him, though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1011'>When he was quite ready--and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain, and pulled the deer"s foot--the hands led him to a splendid room, upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats. The table was laid for supper with two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones. The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key, and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the strangest kind of music that could be heard. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='musician;ear;laughter;fit;sight' adjectives='comical' verbs='stop;send' valence='6.37666666667' arousal='4.42' dominance='5.83777777778'>Prince</entity> hastily stopped up his ears, but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1012'>"What funny thing shall I see next?" he said to himself, and instantly the door opened, and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil. It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords, and a large party of cats followed, who brought in cages full of rats and mice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1013'>The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming, but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil, and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine. She looked very young and very sad, and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;voice' adjectives='sweet;little;young;sad' verbs='go;say;look' valence='5.83272727273' arousal='4.31272727273' dominance='5.44272727273'>Prince</entity>:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1015'>"Lady Cat," replied the Prince, "I thank you for receiving me so kindly, but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat? Indeed, <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='magnificence;castle' adjectives='' verbs='prove;speak' valence='6.342' arousal='3.802' dominance='5.956'>the way</entity> you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1016'>"King"s son," said the White Cat, "I beg you to spare me these compliments, for I am not used to them. But now," she added, "let supper be served, and let the musicians be silent, as the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='musician;supper' adjectives='silent' verbs='be;do;serve;say;add;let;understand' valence='6.00857142857' arousal='3.75071428571' dominance='6.01'>Prince</entity> does not understand what they are saying."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1017'>So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper, and first they put on the table two dishes, one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice. The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all; but the White Cat, seeing this, assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen, and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning. Presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait, and he begged to be allowed to look at it. To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man, who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait! The White Cat sighed as he looked at it, and seemed sadder than ever, and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her; so he began to talk about other things, and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself, and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world. After supper they went into another room, which was fitted up as a theatre, and the cats acted and danced for their amusement, and then the White Cat said good-night to him, and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before, hung with tapestry worked with butterflies" wings of every color; there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor, and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons. The Prince went to bed in silence, as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with the hands that waited on him, and in the morning he was awakened by a noise and confusion outside of his window, and the hands came and quickly dressed him in hunting costume. When he looked out all the cats were assembled in the courtyard, some leading greyhounds, some blowing horns, for the White Cat was going out hunting. The hands led a wooden horse up to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;use;hand' adjectives='wooden;indignant' verbs='be;lead;mount;object;expect;seem;find;prance' valence='5.50529411765' arousal='4.07176470588' dominance='5.41882352941'>Prince</entity>, and seemed to expect him to mount it, at which he was very indignant; but it was no use for him to object, for he speedily found himself upon its back, and it pranced gaily off with him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1018'>The White Cat herself was riding a monkey, which climbed even up to the eagles" nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets. Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before, but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet, which must have contained a magic draught, for, as soon as he had swallowed its contents, he forgot everything, even the little dog that he was seeking for the King, and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat! And so the days passed, in every kind of amusement, until the year was nearly gone. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='country;brother' adjectives='' verbs='do;forget;belong;say;know;have;go;meet' valence='5.83444444444' arousal='3.72611111111' dominance='5.46666666667'>Prince</entity> had forgotten all about meeting his brothers: he did not even know what country he belonged to; but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back, and one day she said to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1019'>"Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father, and your brothers have found lovely ones?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1020'>Then the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='memory' adjectives='' verbs='recover;cry' valence='5.41' arousal='4.775' dominance='4.6525'>Prince</entity> suddenly recovered his memory, and cried:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1021'>"What can have made me forget such an important thing? My whole fortune depends upon it; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom, where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days?" And he began to be very vexed. But the White Cat said to him: "King"s son, do not trouble yourself; I am your friend, and will make everything easy for you. You can still stay here for a day, as the good wooden horse can take you to your country in twelve hours."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1022'>"I thank you, beautiful Cat," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='father;dog;cat' adjectives='beautiful;good' verbs='do;thank;get;say;take;have' valence='5.98388888889' arousal='4.26444444444' dominance='5.64'>Prince</entity>; "but what good will it do me to get back if I have not a dog to take to my father?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1023'>"See here," answered the White Cat, holding up an acorn; "there is a prettier one in this than in the Dogstar!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1024'>"Oh! White Cat dear," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='white;laugh;cat' adjectives='unkind' verbs='be;say' valence='5.72125' arousal='4.59' dominance='5.64875'>Prince</entity>, "how unkind you are to laugh at me now!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1025'>"Only listen," she said, holding the acorn to his ear.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1026'>And inside it he distinctly heard a tiny voice say: "Bow-wow!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1027'>The Prince was delighted, for a dog that can be shut up in an acorn must be very small indeed. He wanted to take it out and look at it, but the White Cat said it would be better not to open the acorn till he was before the King, in case the tiny dog should be cold on the journey. He thanked her a thousand times, and said good-by quite sadly when the time came for him to set out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1028'>"The days have passed so quickly with you," he said, "I only wish I could take you with me now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1029'>But the White Cat shook her head and sighed deeply in answer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1030'>After all the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='amazement;horse;hunter;brother' adjectives='wooden' verbs='stare;be;jump;see;have;meet;arrive;come;agree' valence='6.01842105263' arousal='4.38894736842' dominance='5.81263157895'>Prince</entity> was the first to arrive at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='amazement;horse;hunter;brother' adjectives='wooden' verbs='stare;be;jump;see;have;meet;arrive;come;agree' valence='6.01842105263' arousal='4.38894736842' dominance='5.81263157895'>the castle</entity> where he had agreed to meet his brothers, but they came soon after, and stared in amazement when they saw the wooden horse in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='amazement;horse;hunter;brother' adjectives='wooden' verbs='stare;be;jump;see;have;meet;arrive;come;agree' valence='6.01842105263' arousal='4.38894736842' dominance='5.81263157895'>the courtyard</entity> jumping like a hunter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1031'>The Prince met them joyfully, and they began to tell him all their adventures; but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing, and even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the one he was bringing for the King. Fond as they all were of one another, the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance. The next morning they started in the same chariot. The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them. As for the turnspit, he ran after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all. When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King"s great hall; and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier. They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him. He opened it quickly, and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring. The Prince laid it upon the ground, and it got up at once and began to dance. The King did not know what to say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature. Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle. The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they started as before. The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode back at full speed to his beloved White Cat. Every door of the castle stood wide open, and every window and turret was illuminated, so it looked more wonderful than before. The hands hastened to meet him, and led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the White Cat. She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion, but she very soon started up when she heard the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='basket;satin;cushion' adjectives='little;white' verbs='be;see;overjoy;hear;start' valence='6.048' arousal='3.89333333333' dominance='5.528'>Prince</entity>, and was overjoyed at seeing him once more.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1032'>"How could I hope that you would come back to me King"s son?" she said. And then he stroked and petted her, and told her of his successful journey, and how he had come back to ask her help, as he believed that it was impossible to find what the King demanded. The White Cat looked serious, and said she must think what was to be done, but that, luckily, there were some cats in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='task;anybody;cat' adjectives='serious' verbs='be;set;look;do;manage;say;spin;think' valence='5.95111111111' arousal='3.83666666667' dominance='5.81055555556'>the castle</entity> who could spin very well, and if anybody could manage it they could, and she would set them the task herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1033'>And then the hands appeared carrying torches, and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river, from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts; after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his long ride. And so the days passed quickly as before; it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements--indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be. But when the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='wise' verbs='ask;be;say' valence='6.18' arousal='4.06333333333' dominance='5.90333333333'>Prince</entity> asked her how it was that she was so wise, she only said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1034'>"King"s son, do not ask me; guess what you please. I may not tell you anything."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1035'>The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='muslin;cat;time;trouble;piece;white' adjectives='anxious;happy' verbs='be;do;make;have;go;tell' valence='5.735' arousal='4.14944444444' dominance='5.37166666667'>Prince</entity> was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the time, but presently the White Cat told him that the year was gone, and that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin, as they had made it very well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1036'>"This time," she added, "I can give you a suitable escort"; and on looking out into the courtyard the Prince saw a superb chariot of burnished gold, enameled in flame color with a thousand different devices. It was drawn by twelve snow-white horses, harnessed four abreast; their trappings were flame-colored velvet, embroidered with diamonds. A hundred chariots followed, each drawn by eight horses, and filled with officers in splendid uniforms, and a thousand guards surrounded the procession. "Go!" said the White Cat, "and when you appear before the King in such state he surely will not refuse you the crown which you deserve. Take this walnut, but do not open it until you are before him, then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me for."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1037'>"Lovely Blanchette," said the Prince, "how can I thank you properly for all your kindness to me? Only tell me that you wish it, and I will give up for ever all thought of being king, and will stay here with you always."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1038'>"<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;cat;s;goodness;nothing;son;mouse' adjectives='little;good;white' verbs='be;show;stay;catch;reply;care' valence='6.22666666667' arousal='4.06222222222' dominance='5.62888888889'>King</entity>"s son," she replied, "it shows the goodness of your heart that you should care so much for a little white cat, who is good for nothing but to catch mice; but you must not stay."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1039'>So the Prince kissed her little paw and set out. You can imagine how fast he traveled when I tell you that they reached the King"s palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there. This time the Prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their castle, so they thought he could not be coming, and were rather glad of it, and displayed their pieces of muslin to the King proudly, feeling sure of success. And indeed the stuff was very fine, and would go through the eye of a very large needle; but the King, who was only too glad to make a difficulty, sent for a particular needle, which was kept among the Crown jewels, and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it. The Princes were angry, and were beginning to complain that it was a trick, when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest Prince came in. His father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence, and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it, fully expecting to find the piece of muslin, but instead there was only a hazel-nut. He cracked it, and there lay a cherry-stone. Everybody was looking on, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everybody;muslin;piece;idea;nutshell' adjectives='' verbs='be;look;chuckle;find' valence='6.019' arousal='4.107' dominance='5.631'>the King</entity> was chuckling to himself at the idea of finding the piece of muslin in a nutshell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1040'>However, the Prince cracked the cherry-stone, but everyone laughed when he saw it contained only its own kernel. He opened that and found a grain of wheat, and in that was a millet seed. Then he himself began to wonder, and muttered softly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1041'>"White Cat, White Cat, are you making fun of me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1042'>In an instant he felt a cat"s claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch, and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet seed, and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long, woven with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns; and when the needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest ease! <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='muslin;world;nobody;princes;piece' adjectives='sorrowful;other;pale;silent;marvelous' verbs='turn;deny;find;stand;be' valence='5.50066666667' arousal='3.72466666667' dominance='5.44333333333'>The King</entity> turned pale, and the other Princes stood silent and sorrowful, for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece of muslin that was to be found in the world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1043'>Presently <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sigh;son' adjectives='deep' verbs='turn;say' valence='5.57142857143' arousal='4.08571428571' dominance='5.46142857143'>the King</entity> turned to his sons, and said, with a deep sigh:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1044'>"Nothing could console me more in my old age than to realize your willingness to gratify my wishes. Go then once more, and whoever at the end of a year can bring back the loveliest princess shall be married to her, and shall, without further delay, receive the crown, for my successor must certainly be married." The Prince considered that he had earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred to argue about it, so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot, and, surrounded by his escort, returned to the White Cat faster than he had come. This time she was expecting him, the path was strewn with flowers, and a thousand braziers were burning scented woods which perfumed the air. Seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival, the White Cat waited for him. "Well, King"s son," she said, "here you are once more, without a crown." "Madam," said he, "thanks to your generosity I have earned one twice over; but the fact is that my father is so loth to part with it that it would be no pleasure to me to take it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1045'>"Never mind," she answered, "it"s just as well to try and deserve it. As you must take back a lovely princess with you next time I will be on the look-out for one for you. In the meantime let us enjoy ourselves; to-night I have ordered a battle between my cats and the river rats on purpose to amuse you." So this year slipped away even more pleasantly than the preceding ones. Sometimes the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='white;cat' adjectives='' verbs='ask;be;help;talk' valence='6.32714285714' arousal='3.94' dominance='5.81428571429'>Prince</entity> could not help asking the White Cat how it was she could talk.</paragraph>

But imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely princess stood before him, and, while he was still speechless with amazement, the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies entered, each carrying a cat"s skin! They hastened with every sign of joy to the Princess, kissing her hand and congratulating her on being once more restored to her natural shape.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1052'>"You see, Prince, that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary cat. My father reigned over six kingdoms. The Queen, my mother, whom he loved dearly, had a passion for traveling and exploring, and when I was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales, and set out, taking with her a number of her attendants. On the way they had to pass near an old castle belonging to the fairies. Nobody had ever been into it, but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things, and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else. She began to wish to try them for herself, and turned her steps in the direction of the garden. On arriving at the door, which blazed with gold and jewels, she ordered her servants to knock loudly, but it was useless; it seemed as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead. Now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit, the more the Queen was determined that have it she would. So she ordered that they should bring ladders, and get over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ladder;top' adjectives='high;impossible' verbs='do;look;get;make;bring;tie;be;order' valence='5.64235294118' arousal='3.71117647059' dominance='5.52352941176'>the wall</entity> into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ladder;top' adjectives='high;impossible' verbs='do;look;get;make;bring;tie;be;order' valence='5.64235294118' arousal='3.71117647059' dominance='5.52352941176'>the garden</entity>; but though <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ladder;top' adjectives='high;impossible' verbs='do;look;get;make;bring;tie;be;order' valence='5.64235294118' arousal='3.71117647059' dominance='5.52352941176'>the wall</entity> did not look very high, and they tied the ladders together to make them very long, it was quite impossible to get to the top.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1053'>"The Queen was in despair, but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were, and went to bed herself, feeling quite ill, she was so disappointed. In the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened, and saw to her surprise a tiny, ugly old woman seated by her bedside, who said to her:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1054'>""I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit; but to save you annoyance, my sisters and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away, on one condition--that is, that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1055'>""Ah! my dear madam," cried the Queen, "is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit? I will give you my kingdoms willingly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1056'>""No," replied the old fairy, "we will have nothing but your little daughter. She shall be as happy as the day is long, and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairy-land, but you must not see her again until she is married."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1058'>"So the old fairy led her into the castle, and, though it was still the middle of the night, the Queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told, which you can easily believe, Prince," said the White Cat, "when I tell you that it was this castle that we are now in. "Will you gather the fruit yourself, Queen?" said the old fairy, "or shall I call it to come to you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1059'>""I beg you to let me see it come when it is called," cried the Queen; "that will be something quite new." The old fairy whistled twice, then she cried:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1061'>"And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another, and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt, and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them. You see they grew upon fairy trees.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1062'>"The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away, and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry. Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement, and led her back to the camp, and next morning she went back to her kingdom, but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain, and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened, and asked what was the matter. At first the Queen was afraid to tell him, but when, as soon as they reached the palace, five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me, she was obliged to confess what she had promised. The King was very angry, and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded, and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met, and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country; and at last, after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster, the King, to save his subjects, was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies. This time they came themselves to fetch me, in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses, followed by the dragon, who was led with chains of diamonds. My cradle was placed between the old fairies, who loaded me with caresses, and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me. There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare, and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess, but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog, who could both talk; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies, who came mounted upon the dragon. One day, however, as I sat at my window I saw a handsome young prince, who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison, and who was standing and looking up at me. When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference. You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to, and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell, then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell. But after that he came again many times and at last I consented to marry him, but the question was how was I to escape from my tower. The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning, and by great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower; but, alas! just as my prince was helping me to descend it, the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in. Before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon. As for me, the fairies, furious at having their plans defeated, for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs, and I utterly refused, changed me into a white cat. When they brought me here I found all the lords and ladies of my father"s court awaiting me under the same enchantment, while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible, all but their hands.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1063'>"As they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history, for until then I had quite believed that I was their child, and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover.</paragraph>

Their hut was quite hidden by trees, and none saw their beauty but the sun by day, and the moon by night, and the eyes of the stars. The old woman kept the girls hard at work, from morning till night, spinning gold flax into yarn, and when one distaff was empty another was given them, so they had no rest. The thread had to be fine and even, and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman, who twice or thrice every summer went a journey. Before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence, and always returned in the night, so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her, neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came, nor what it was to be used for.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1085'>Now, when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys, she gave each maiden work for six days, with the usual warning: "Children, don"t let your eyes wander, and on no account speak to a man, for, if you do, your thread will lose its brightness, and misfortunes of all kinds will follow." They laughed at this oft-repeated caution, saying to each other: "How can our gold thread lose its brightness, and have we any chance of speaking to a man?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1086'>On the third day after the old woman"s departure a young prince, hunting in the forest, got separated from his companions, and completely lost.

At last he perceived a narrow foot-path, which he eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut. The maidens, who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness, saw him approaching, and the two elder were much alarmed, for they remembered the old woman"s warning; but the youngest said: "Never before have I seen anyone like him; let me have one look." They entreated her to come in, but, seeing that she would not, left her, and the Prince, coming up, courteously greeted the maiden, and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary. She set food before him, and was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old woman"s caution, and lingered for hours.

When he had gone, she sat down to her wheel to make up for lost time, but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all its brightness.

"How can I help thee?" asked the raven. She answered: "Fly away, until thou comest to a splendid town, where stands a king"s palace; seek out the king"s son and tell him that a great misfortune has befallen me." Then she told the raven how her thread had lost its brightness, how terribly angry the old woman was, and how she feared some great disaster. The raven promised faithfully to do her bidding, and, spreading its wings, flew away. The maiden now went home and worked hard all day at winding up the yarn her elder sisters had spun, for the old woman would let her spin no longer. Toward evening she heard the raven"s "craa, craa," from the pine tree and eagerly hastened thither to hear the answer.</paragraph>

Then he said to the wind wizard"s son: "Beg the raven to fly quickly back to the maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night, for then will I come and fetch her away." The wind wizard"s son did this, and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening.

The Prince tried to jump in after her, but his men held him back, and in spite of his struggles led him home, where for six weeks he shut himself up in a secret chamber, and would neither eat nor drink, so great was his grief. At last he became so ill his life was despaired of, and in great alarm the King caused all the wizards of his country to be summoned. But none could cure him. At last the wind wizard"s son said to the King: "Send for the old wizard from Finland he knows more than all the wizards of your kingdom put together." A messenger was at once sent to Finland, and a week later the old wizard himself arrived on the wings of the wind. "Honored King," said the wizard, "the wind has blown this illness upon your son, and a magic ball has snatched away his beloved. This it is which makes him grieve so constantly.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1105'>The Prince suddenly remembered the gold-spinners, and said to himself: "If I ride thither, who knows but that they could explain this to me?" He at once rode to the hut, and found the two maidens at the fountain. He told them what had befallen their sister the year before, and how he had twice heard a strange song, but yet could see no singer. They said that the yellow water-lily could be none other than their sister, who was not dead, but transformed by the magic ball. Before he went to bed, the eldest made a cake of magic herbs, which she gave him to eat. In the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other. Next morning he told this to the maidens, and they said that the charmed cake had caused it, and advised him to listen well to the birds, and see what they could tell him, and when he had recovered his bride they begged him to return and deliver them from their wretched bondage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1106'>Having promised this, he joyfully returned home, and as he was riding through the forest he could perfectly understand all that the birds said. He heard a thrush say to a magpie: "How stupid men are! they cannot understand the simplest thing. It is now quite a year since the maiden was transformed into a water-lily, and, though she sings so sadly that anyone going over the bridge must hear her, yet no one comes to her aid. Her former bridegroom rode over it a few days ago and heard her singing, but was no wiser than the rest."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1107'>"And he is to blame for all her misfortunes," added the magpie. "If he heeds only the words of men she will remain a flower for ever.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1108'>After hearing this, the Prince wondered how he could get a message conveyed to Finland. He heard one swallow say to another: "Come, let us fly to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nest' adjectives='better' verbs='fly;say;let;build;hear;swallow;come' valence='6.029' arousal='3.555' dominance='6.059'>Finland</entity>; we can build better nests there."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1109'>"Stop, kind friends!" cried the Prince. "Will you do something for me?" The birds consented, and he said: "Take a thousand greetings from me to the wizard of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='flower;maiden;form;wizard;greeting;bird' adjectives='own' verbs='restore;consent;transform;say;take;ask' valence='5.77631578947' arousal='4.28368421053' dominance='5.78105263158'>Finland</entity>, and ask him how I may restore a maiden transformed into a flower to her own form."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1110'>The swallows flew away, and the Prince rode on to the bridge. There he waited, hoping to hear the song. But he heard nothing but the rushing of the water and the moaning of the wind, and, disappointed, rode home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1111'>Shortly after, he was sitting in the garden, thinking that the swallows must have forgotten his message, when he saw an eagle flying above him. The bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the Prince and said: "The wizard of Finland greets thee and bids me say that thou mayest free the maiden thus: Go to the river and smear thyself all over with mud; then say: "From a man into a crab," and thou wilt become a crab. Plunge boldly into the water, swim as close as thou canst to the water-lily"s roots, and loosen them from the mud and reeds. This done, fasten thy claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface. Let the water flow all over the flower, and drift with the current until thou comest to a mountain ash tree on the left bank. There is near it a large stone. Stop there and say: "From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden," and ye both will be restored to your own forms."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1112'>Full of doubt and fear, the Prince let some time pass before he was bold enough to attempt to rescue the maiden. Then a crow said to him: "Why dost thou hesitate? The old wizard has not told thee wrong, neither have the birds deceived thee; hasten and dry the maiden"s tears."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1113'>"Nothing worse than death can befall me," thought the Prince, "and death is better than endless sorrow." So he mounted his horse and went to the bridge. Again he heard the water-lily"s lament, and, hesitating no longer, smeared himself all over with mud, and, saying: "From a man into a crab," plunged into the river. For one moment the water hissed in his ears, and then all was silent. He swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots, but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time. He then grasped them and rose to the surface, letting the water flow over the flower. The current carried them down the stream, but nowhere could he see the mountain ash. At last he saw it, and close by the large stone. Here he stopped and said: "From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden," and to his delight found himself once more a prince, and the maiden was by his side. She was ten times more beautiful than before, and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe, sparkling with jewels. She thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witch"s power, and willingly consented to marry him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1114'>But when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was nowhere to be seen, for, though the Prince thought he had been a crab only a few hours, he had in reality been under the water for more than ten days. While they were wondering how they should reach his father"s court, they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses coming along the bank. In this they drove to the palace. The King and Queen were at church, weeping for their son, whom they had long mourned for dead. Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince entered, leading the beautiful maiden by the hand. The wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merry-making throughout <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wedding' adjectives='celebrated' verbs='merry-make;be;feast' valence='6.30571428571' arousal='4.02142857143' dominance='5.7'>the kingdom</entity> for six weeks.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1115'>Some time afterward the Prince and his bride were sitting in the garden, when a crow said to them: "Ungrateful creatures! Have you forgotten the two poor maidens who helped you in your distress? Must they spin gold flax for ever? Have no pity on the old witch. The three maidens are princesses, whom she stole away when they were children together, with all the silver utensils, which she turned into gold flax. Poison were her fittest punishment."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1116'>The Prince was ashamed of having forgotten his promise and set out at once, and by great good fortune reached the hut when the old woman was away. The maidens had dreamed that he was coming, and were ready to go with him, but first they made a cake in which they put poison, and left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she returned. She _did_ see it, and thought it looked so tempting that she greedily ate it up and at once died.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1120'>Once upon a time there was a king whose only child was a girl. Now the King had been very anxious to have a son, or at least a grandson, to come after him, but he was told by a prophet whom he consulted that his own daughter"s son should kill him. This news terrified him so much that he determined never to let his daughter be married, for he thought it was better to have no grandson at all than to be killed by his grandson. He therefore called his workmen together, and bade them dig a deep round hole in the earth, and then he had a prison of brass built in the hole, and then, when it was finished, he locked up his daughter. No man ever saw her, and she never saw even the fields and the sea, but only the sky and the sun, for there was a wide open window in the roof of the house of brass. So the Princess would sit looking up at the sky, and watching the clouds float across, and wondering whether she should ever get out of her prison. Now one day it seemed to her that the sky opened above her, and a great shower of shining gold fell through the window in the roof, and lay glittering in her room. Not very long after, the Princess had a baby, a little boy, but when the King her father heard of it he was very angry and afraid, for now the child was born that should be his death. Yet, cowardly as he was, he had not quite the heart to kill the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;sea;country;chest;way;baby' adjectives='cowardly;brass-bound;huge' verbs='be;starve;thrust;drown;kill;have;put;come' valence='5.3452173913' arousal='4.31391304348' dominance='5.17739130435'>Princess</entity> and her baby outright, but he had them put in a huge brass-bound chest and thrust out to sea, that they might either be drowned or starved, or perhaps come to a country where they would be out of his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1121'>So the Princess and the baby floated and drifted in the chest on the sea all day and night, but the baby was not afraid of the waves nor of the wind, for he did not know that they could hurt him, and he slept quite soundly. And the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='song' adjectives='' verbs='sing;be' valence='6.91666666667' arousal='4.525' dominance='6.135'>Princess</entity> sang a song over him, and this was her song:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1122'>"Child, my child, how sound you sleep!   Though your mother"s care is deep,   You can lie with heart at rest   In the narrow brass-bound chest;   In the starless night and drear   You can sleep, and never hear   Billows breaking, and the cry   Of the night-wind wandering by;   In soft purple mantle sleeping   With your little face on mine,   Hearing not your mother weeping   And the breaking of the brine."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1123'>Well, the daylight came at last, and the great chest was driven by the waves against the shore of an island. There the brass-bound chest lay, with the Princess and her baby in it, till a man of that country came past, and saw it, and dragged it on to the beach, and when he had broken it open, behold! there was a beautiful lady and a little boy. So he took them home, and was very kind to them, and brought up the boy till he was a young man. Now when the boy had come to his full strength the King of that country fell in love with his mother, and wanted to marry her, but he knew that she would never part from her boy. So he thought of a plan to get rid of the boy, and this was his plan: A great Queen of a country not far off was going to be married, and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her. And he made a feast to which he invited them all, and they all brought their presents; some brought gold cups, and some brought necklaces of gold and amber, and some brought beautiful horses; but the boy had nothing, though he was the son of a princess, for his mother had nothing to give him. Then the rest of the company began to laugh at him, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;company;head;laugh;rest' adjectives='terrible;least' verbs='begin;give;say;have;go;fetch' valence='6.05' arousal='4.1475' dominance='5.63583333333'>the King</entity> said: "If you have nothing else to give, at least you might go and fetch the Terrible Head."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1126'>Then they told him that somewhere, a long way off, there dwelt three dreadful sisters, monstrous ogrish women, with golden wings and claws of brass, and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair. Now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone. And two of them could not be put to death, but the youngest, whose face was very beautiful, could be killed, and it was _her_ head that the boy had promised to bring. You may imagine it was no easy adventure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1127'>When he heard all this he was perhaps sorry that he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head, but he was determined to keep his oath.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1128'>There he went and sat down on a rock, looking toward the sea, and wondering how he should begin to fulfill his vow. Then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder; and he turned, and saw a young man like a king"s son, having with him a tall and beautiful lady, whose blue eyes shone like stars. They were taller than mortal men, and the young man had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it, and two golden serpents twisted round it, and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1131'>The boy answered that he knew not where such things were to be procured, and that, wanting them, he could only try and fail.

But, behold! they had vanished, he knew not how or where! Then he leaped in the air to try the Shoes of Swiftness, and they carried him more swiftly than the wind, over the warm blue sea, over the happy lands of the south, over the northern peoples who drank mare"s milk and lived in great wagons, wandering after their flocks. Across the wide rivers, where the wild fowl rose and fled before him, and over the plains and the cold North Sea he went, over the fields of snow and the hills of ice, to a place where the world ends, and all water is frozen, and there are no men, nor beasts, nor any green grass. There in a blue cave of the ice he found the Three Gray Sisters, the oldest of living things. Their hair was as white as the snow, and their flesh of an icy blue, and they mumbled and nodded in a kind of dream, and their frozen breath hung round them like a cloud. Now the opening of the cave in the ice was narrow, and it was not easy to pass in without touching one of the Gray Sisters.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1142'>When the gray women heard that laugh they began to weep, for now they knew that a stranger had robbed them, and that they could not help themselves, and their tears froze as they fell from the hollows where no eyes were, and rattled on the icy ground of the cave.

Then he gave them back the eye, and they began to look out once more for the old times coming back again. But the boy flew south between sea and land, keeping the land always on his left hand, till he saw a beautiful island crowned with flowering trees. There he alighted, and there he found the Three Fairies of the Garden.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1170'>These grave dancing fairies were very unlike the Grey Women, and they were glad to see the boy, and treated him kindly. Then they asked him why he had come; and he told them how he was sent to find the Sword of Sharpness and the Cap of Darkness. And the fairies gave him these, and a wallet, and a shield, and belted the sword, which had a diamond blade, round his waist, and the cap they set on his head, and told him that now even they could not see him though they were fairies. Then he took it off, and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune, and then they began again their eternal dance round the golden tree, for it is their business to guard it till the new times come, or till the world"s ending. So the boy put the cap on his head, and hung the wallet round his waist, and the shining shield on his shoulders, and flew beyond the great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world. And by the banks of that river, there he found the three Terrible Women all asleep beneath a poplar tree, and the dead poplar leaves lay all about them. Their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed, and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds, and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold. But the youngest slept between her two sisters, and she lay on her back, with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky; and though she slept her eyes were wide open. If the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it, she was so awful; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face. As soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders, and held it up like a mirror, so that he saw the Dreadful Women reflected in it, and did not see the Terrible Head itself. Then he came nearer and nearer, till he reckoned that he was within a sword"s stroke of the youngest, and he guessed where he should strike a back blow behind him. Then he drew the Sword of Sharpness and struck once, and the Terrible Head was cut from the shoulders of the creature, and the blood leaped out and struck him like a blow. But he thrust the Terrible Head into his wallet, and flew away without looking behind. Then the two Dreadful Sisters who were left wakened, and rose in the air like great birds; and though they could not see him because of his Cap of Darkness, they flew after him up the wind, following by the scent through the clouds, like hounds hunting in a wood. They came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden wings, and their shrieks to each other: "_here, here,_" "_no, there; this way he went,_" as they chased him. But the Shoes of Swiftness flew too fast for them, and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1171'>Now when the horrible creatures were far in the distance, and the boy found himself on the right side of the river, he flew straight eastward, trying to seek his own country. But as he looked down from the air he saw a very strange sight--a beautiful girl chained to a stake at the high-water mark of the sea. The girl was so frightened or so tired that she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist, and there she hung, as if she were dead. The boy was very sorry for her and flew down and stood beside her. When he spoke she raised her head and looked round, but his voice only seemed to frighten her. Then he remembered that he was wearing the Cap of Darkness, and that she could only hear him, not see him. So he took it off, and there he stood before her, the handsomest young man she had ever seen in all her life, with short curly yellow hair, and blue eyes, and a laughing face. And he thought her the most beautiful girl in the world. So first with one blow of the Sword of Sharpness he cut the iron chain that bound her, and then he asked her what she did there, and why men treated her so cruelly. And she told him that she was the daughter of the King of that country, and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea; for the beast came and devoured a girl every day. Now the lot had fallen on her; and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl. But the beast had been too greedy and too hurried, so he missed his aim the first time. Before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the Terrible Head out of his wallet and held it up. And when the sea beast leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head, and instantly it was turned into a stone. And the stone beast is there on the sea-coast to this day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1172'>Then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the King, her father, where everyone was weeping for her death, and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well. And the King and Queen made much of the boy, and could not contain themselves for delight when they found he wanted to marry their daughter. So the two were married with the most splendid rejoicings, and when they had passed some time at court they went home in a ship to the boy"s own country. For he could not carry his bride through the air, so he took the Shoes of Swiftness, and the Cap of Darkness, and the Sword of Sharpness up to a lonely place in the hills. There he left them, and there they were found by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;woman;journey' adjectives='' verbs='be;help;leave;start;have;meet;find' valence='6.28307692308' arousal='3.91615384615' dominance='5.92769230769'>the man</entity> and woman who had met him at home beside <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='home;woman;journey' adjectives='' verbs='be;help;leave;start;have;meet;find' valence='6.28307692308' arousal='3.91615384615' dominance='5.92769230769'>the sea</entity>, and had helped him to start on his journey.</paragraph>

For if she had liked the King ill before, she liked him far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly. She did not know, of course, where the boy had gone, but thought the King had slain him secretly. So now she was running for her very life, and the wicked King was following her with a sword in his hand.

And because she was so beautiful, and because her hair was like the finest gold, and waved and rippled nearly to the ground, she was called Pretty Goldilocks. She always wore a crown of flowers, and her dresses were embroidered with diamonds and pearls, and everybody who saw her fell in love with her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1181'>Now one of her neighbors was a young king who was not married. He was very rich and handsome, and when he heard all that was said about Pretty Goldilocks, though he had never seen her, he fell so deeply in love with her that he could neither eat nor drink. So he resolved to send an ambassador to ask her in marriage. He had a splendid carriage made for his ambassador, and gave him more than a hundred horses and a hundred servants, and told him to be sure and bring the Princess back with him. After he had started nothing else was talked of at Court, and the King felt so sure that the Princess would consent that he set his people to work at pretty dresses and splendid furniture, that they might be ready by the time she came. Meanwhile, the ambassador arrived at the Princess"s palace and delivered his little message, but whether she happened to be cross that day, or whether the compliment did not please her, is not known. She only answered that she was very much obliged to the King, but she had no wish to be married.

It was on a Monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand, thinking of nothing but how he could persuade the Princess Goldilocks to marry the King. He had a writing-book in his pocket, and whenever any happy thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down under the trees to put it into the harangue which he was preparing for the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thought;horse;tree;pocket;writing-book;harangue' adjectives='happy' verbs='be;forget;prepare;sit;put;dismount;have;strike' valence='5.81933333333' arousal='4.24333333333' dominance='5.678'>Princess</entity>, before he forgot it.</paragraph>

In leaping after little flies she had thrown herself high upon the bank, where she had lain till she was nearly dead.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1219'>"How am I to find a ring that fell into the river a month ago?" said he. "It is useless to try; the Princess must have told me to do it on purpose, knowing it was impossible." And then he sighed again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1220'>Frisk heard him and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1221'>"My dear master, don"t despair; the luck may change, you are too good not to be happy.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1222'>But Charming only gave him two little pats and said nothing, and very soon he fell asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1223'>At the first glimmer of dawn Frisk began to jump about, and when he had waked Charming they went out together, first into the garden, and then down to the river"s brink, where they wandered up and down. Charming was thinking sadly of having to go back unsuccessful when he heard someone calling: "Charming, Charming!" He looked all about him and thought he must be dreaming, as he could not see anybody. Then he walked on and the voice called again: "Charming, Charming!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1224'>"Who calls me?" said he. Frisk, who was very small and could look closely into the water, cried out: "I see a golden carp coming." And sure enough there was the great carp, who said to Charming:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1225'>"You saved my life in the meadow by the willow tree, and I promised that I would repay you. Take this, it is Princess Goldilock"s ring." Charming took the ring out of Dame Carp"s mouth, thanking her a thousand times, and he and tiny Frisk went straight to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='someone;carp;s;mouth;time;ring;dame' adjectives='tiny;charming' verbs='be;thank;ask;see;take;go;tell' valence='5.9475' arousal='4.373' dominance='5.6895'>the palace</entity>, where someone told the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='someone;carp;s;mouth;time;ring;dame' adjectives='tiny;charming' verbs='be;thank;ask;see;take;go;tell' valence='5.9475' arousal='4.373' dominance='5.6895'>Princess</entity> that he was asking to see her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1226'>"Ah! poor fellow," said she, "he must have come to say good-by, finding it impossible to do as I asked."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1227'>So in came Charming, who presented her with the ring and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1229'>"Truly, Charming," said she, "you must be the favorite of some fairy, or you could never have found it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1230'>"Madam," answered he, "I was helped by nothing but my desire to obey your wishes."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1231'>"Since you are so kind," said she, "perhaps you will do me another service, for till it is done I will never be married. There is a prince not far from here whose name is Galifron, who once wanted to marry me, but when I refused he uttered the most terrible threats against me, and vowed that he would lay waste my country. But what could I do? I could not marry a frightful giant as tall as a tower, who eats up people as a monkey eats chestnuts, and who talks so loud that anybody who has to listen to him becomes quite deaf. Nevertheless, he does not cease to persecute me and to kill my subjects. So before I can listen to your proposal you must kill him and bring me his head."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1232'>Charming was rather dismayed at this command, but he answered:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1234'>Then the Princess was frightened and said everything she could think of to prevent Charming from fighting the giant, but it was of no use, and he went out to arm himself suitably, and then, taking little Frisk with him, he mounted his horse and set out for Galifron"s country. Everyone he met told him what a terrible giant Galifron was, and that nobody dared go near him; and the more he heard, the more frightened he grew. Frisk tried to encourage him by saying: "While you are fighting <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='master;heel;frisk' adjectives='' verbs='be;look;bite;stoop;say;fight;try;encourage;kill;go' valence='5.16611111111' arousal='4.60888888889' dominance='5.50166666667'>the giant</entity>, dear master, I will go and bite his heels, and when he stoops down to look at me you can kill him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1235'>Charming praised his little dog"s plan, but knew that this help would not do much good.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1236'>At last he drew near the giant"s castle, and saw to his horror that every path that led to it was strewn with bones. Before long he saw Galifron coming. His head was higher than the tallest trees, and he sang in a terrible voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1237'>"Bring out your little boys and girls,   Pray do not stay to do their curls,   For I shall eat so very many,   I shall not know if they have any."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1238'>Thereupon Charming sang out as loud as he could to the same tune:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1239'>"Come out and meet the valiant Charming   Who finds you not at all alarming;   Although he is not very tall,   He"s big enough to make you fall."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1240'>The rhymes were not very correct, but you see he had made them up so quickly that it is a miracle that they were not worse; especially as he was horribly frightened all the time. When Galifron heard these words he looked all about him, and saw Charming standing, sword in hand this put the giant into a terrible rage, and he aimed a blow at Charming with his huge iron club, which would certainly have killed him if it had reached him, but at that instant a raven perched upon the giant"s head, and, pecking with its strong beak and beating with its great wings so confused and blinded him that all his blows fell harmlessly upon the air, and Charming, rushing in, gave him several strokes with his sharp sword so that he fell to the ground. Whereupon Charming cut off his head before he knew anything about it, and the raven from a tree close by croaked out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1241'>"You see I have not forgotten the good turn you did me in killing the eagle. To-day I think I have fulfilled my promise of repaying you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1242'>"Indeed, I owe you more gratitude than you ever owed me," replied Charming.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1243'>And then he mounted his horse and rode off with <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;s' adjectives='' verbs='mount;head;ride' valence='5.712' arousal='4.56' dominance='5.436'>Galifron</entity>"s head.</paragraph>

It is some of this water that I really must have: everything it touches becomes wonderful. The beautiful things will always remain beautiful, and the ugly things become lovely. If one is young one never grows old, and if one is old one becomes young. You see, Charming, I could not leave my kingdom without taking some of it with me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1249'>"Princess," said he, "you at least can never need this water, but I am an unhappy ambassador, whose death you desire. Where you send me I will go, though I know I shall never return."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1250'>And, as the Princess Goldilocks showed no sign of relenting, he started with his little dog for the Gloomy Cavern.

He is going to the cavern alone, though if he had a hundred men with him he could not succeed. Why does the Princess ask impossibilities?" Charming said nothing, but he was very sad. When he was near the top of a hill he dismounted to let his horse graze, while Frisk amused himself by chasing flies. Charming knew he could not be far from the Gloomy Cavern, and on looking about him he saw a black hideous rock from which came a thick smoke, followed in a moment by one of the dragons with fire blazing from his mouth and eyes. His body was yellow and green, and his claws scarlet, and his tail was so long that it lay in a hundred coils. Frisk was so terrified at the sight of it that he did not know where to hide. Charming, quite determined to get the water or die, now drew his sword, and, taking the crystal flask which Pretty Goldilocks had given him to fill, said to Frisk:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1252'>"I feel sure that I shall never come back from this expedition; when I am dead, go to the Princess and tell her that her errand has cost me my life.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1256'>He went straight to the palace and gave the flask to the Princess, who had no further objection to make.

Then the King took it into his head that perhaps he was not handsome enough to please the Princess Goldilocks, and he thought he would bathe his face with the water from the Fountain of Beauty, which was in the flask on a shelf in the Princess"s room, where she had placed it that she might see it often. Now it happened that one of the Princess"s ladies in chasing a spider had knocked the flask off the shelf and broken it, and every drop of the water had been spilt. Not knowing what to do, she had hastily swept away the pieces of crystal, and then remembered that in the King"s room she had seen a flask of exactly the same shape, also filled with sparkling water.

This pleased little Whittington very much, as he wanted to see London sadly, for he had heard that the streets were paved with gold, and he was willing to get a bushel of it; but how great was his disappointment, poor boy! when he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold, and found himself in a strange place, without a friend, without food, and without money.</paragraph>

She could not leave the place until she had buried them in a pretty little mossy grave at the foot of a tree, and she wrote their names upon the bark of the tree, and how they had all died to save her life. And then she began to think where she could go for safety--for this forest was so close to her father"s castle that she might be seen and recognized by the first passer-by, and, besides that, it was full of lions and wolves, who would have snapped up a princess just as soon as a stray chicken. So she began to walk as fast as she could, but the forest was so large and the sun was so hot that she nearly died of heat and terror and fatigue; look which way she would there seemed to be no end to the forest, and she was so frightened that she fancied every minute that she heard the King running after her to kill her. You may imagine how miserable she was, and how she cried as she went on, not knowing which path to follow, and with the thorny bushes scratching her dreadfully and tearing her pretty frock to pieces.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1360'>At last she heard the bleating of a sheep, and said to herself:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1361'>"No doubt there are shepherds here with their flocks; they will show me the way to some village where I can live disguised as a peasant girl.

Nearly a hundred other sheep were scattered about, not eating the grass, but some drinking coffee, lemonade, or sherbet, others eating ices, strawberries and cream, or sweetmeats, while others, again, were playing games.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1373'>The Sheep with the golden horns ordered that his chariot should be fetched, and a moment after appeared six goats, harnessed to a pumpkin, which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it, and was all lined with cushions of velvet and down. The Princess stepped into it, much amused at such a new kind of carriage, the King of the Sheep took his place beside her, and the goats ran away with them at full speed, and only stopped when they reached a cavern, the entrance to which was blocked by a great stone. This the King touched with his foot, and immediately it fell down, and he invited the Princess to enter without fear. Now, if she had not been so alarmed by everything that had happened, nothing could have induced her to go into this frightful cave, but she was so afraid of what might be behind her that she would have thrown herself even down a well at this moment. So, without hesitation, she followed the Sheep, who went before her, down, down, down, until she thought they must come out at the other side of the world--indeed, she was not sure that he wasn"t leading her into Fairyland. At last she saw before her a great plain, quite covered with all sorts of flowers, the scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled before; a broad river of orange-flower water flowed round it and fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the prettiest little cascades and brooks. The plain was covered with the strangest trees, there were whole avenues where partridges, ready roasted, hung from every branch, or, if you preferred pheasants, quails, turkeys, or rabbits, you had only to turn to the right hand or to the left and you were sure to find them. In places the air was darkened by showers of lobster-patties, white puddings, sausages, tarts, and all sorts of sweetmeats, or with pieces of gold and silver, diamonds and pearls.

The good folks were extremely glad to see their children once more at home, and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted; but, when the money was all gone, they fell again into their former uneasiness, and resolved to lose them again; and, that they might be the surer of doing it, to carry them to a much greater distance than before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1453'>They could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by Little Thumb, who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former; but, though he got up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles, he was disappointed, for he found the house-door double-locked, and was at a stand what to do.

Little Thumb was not very uneasy at it, for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered all along as he came; but he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb; the birds had come and had eaten it up, every bit.

Upon this she hid them under the bed and went to open the door. The Ogre presently asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn, and then sat himself down to table. The sheep was as yet all raw and bloody; but he liked it the better for that. He sniffed about to the right and left, saying:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1469'>With that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one. The poor children fell upon their knees, and begged his pardon; but they had to do with one of the most cruel ogres in the world, who, far from having any pity on them, had already devoured them with his eyes, and told his wife they would be delicate eating when tossed up with good savory sauce. He then took a great knife, and, coming up to these poor children, whetted it upon a great whet-stone which he held in his left hand. He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1475'>The Ogre had seven daughters, all little children, and these young ogresses had all of them very fine complexions, because they used to eat fresh meat like their father; but they had little gray eyes, quite round, hooked noses, and very long sharp teeth, standing at a good distance from each other. They were not as yet over and above mischievous, but they promised very fair for it, for they had already bitten little children, that they might suck their blood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1476'>They had been put to bed early, with every one a crown of gold upon her head. There was in the same chamber a bed of the like bigness, and it was into this bed the Ogre"s wife put the seven little boys, after which she went to bed to her husband.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1477'>Little Thumb, who had observed that the Ogre"s daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent his not killing them, got up about midnight, and, taking his brothers" bonnets and his own, went very softly and put them upon the heads of the seven little ogresses, after having taken off their crowns of gold, which he put upon his own head and his brothers", that the Ogre might take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1485'>Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife. So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers, and bade them all put on their clothes presently and follow him. They stole down softly into the garden, and got over the wall. They kept running about all night, and trembled all the while, without knowing which way they went.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1486'>The Ogre, when he awoke, said to his wife: "Go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1487'>The wife was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after what manner she should dress them; but, thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes, she went up, and was strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed, and weltering in their blood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1488'>She fainted away, for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases. The Ogre, fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered, went up himself to help her. He was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1489'>"Ah! what have I done?" cried he. "The wretches shall pay for it, and that instantly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1490'>He threw a pitcher of water upon his wife"s face, and, having brought her to herself, said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1491'>"Give me quickly my boots of seven leagues, that I may go and catch them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1492'>He went out, and, having run over a vast deal of ground, both on this side and that, he came at last into the very road where the poor children were, and not above a hundred paces from their father"s house. They espied the Ogre, who went at one step from mountain to mountain, and over rivers as easily as the narrowest kennels. Little Thumb, seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were, made his brothers hide themselves in it, and crowded into it himself, minding always what would become of the Ogre.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1493'>The Ogre, who found himself much tired with his long and fruitless journey (for these boots of seven leagues greatly fatigued the wearer), had a great mind to rest himself, and, by chance, went to sit down upon the rock where the little boys had hid themselves. As it was impossible he could be more weary than he was, he fell asleep, and, after reposing himself some time, began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he held up his great knife and was going to cut their throats. Little Thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers, and told them that they should run away immediately toward home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they should not be in any pain about him. They took his advice, and got home presently. Little Thumb came up to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own legs. The boots were very long and large, but, as they were fairies, they had the gift of becoming big and little, according to the legs of those who wore them; so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him. He went immediately to the Ogre"s house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the Ogre"s murdered daughters.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1494'>"Your husband," said Little Thumb, "is in very great danger, being taken by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver. The very moment they held their daggers at his throat he perceived me, and desired me to come and tell you the condition he is in, and that you should give me whatsoever he has of value, without retaining any one thing; for otherwise they will kill him without mercy; and, as his case is very pressing, he desired me to make use (you see I have them on) of his boots, that I might make the more haste and to show you that I do not impose upon you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1495'>The good woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had: for this Ogre was a very good husband, though he used to eat up little children. Little Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre"s money, came home to his father"s house, where he was received with abundance of joy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1496'>There are many people who do not agree in this circumstance, and pretend that Little Thumb never robbed the Ogre at all, and that he only thought he might very justly, and with a safe conscience, take off his boots of seven leagues, because he made no other use of them but to run after little children. These folks affirm that they are very well assured of this, and the more as having drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker"s house. They aver that when Little Thumb had taken off the Ogre"s boots he went to Court, where he was informed that they were very much in pain about a certain army, which was two hundred leagues off, and the success of a battle. He went, say they, to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='news;army' adjectives='' verbs='go;desire;say;tell;bring' valence='5.843' arousal='4.457' dominance='5.476'>the King</entity>, and told him that, if he desired it, he would bring him news from the army before night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1497'>The King promised him a great sum of money upon that condition. Little Thumb was as good as his word, and returned that very same night with the news; and, this first expedition causing him to be known, he got whatever he pleased, for the King paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army. After having for some time carried on the business of a messenger, and gained thereby great wealth, he went home to his father, where it was impossible to express the joy they were all in at his return. He made the whole family very easy, bought places for his father and brothers, and, by that means, settled them very handsomely in the world, and, in the meantime, made his court to perfection.(1)</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1501'>In a town in Persia there dwelt two brothers, one named Cassim, the other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty, while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighboring forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him in a cloud of dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety. When they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them. They unbridled their horses and tied them to trees. The finest man among them, whom Ali Baba took to be their captain, went a little way among some bushes, and said: "Open, Sesame!"(1) so plainly that Ali Baba heard him. A door opened in the rocks, and having made the troop go in, he followed them, and the door shut again of itself. They stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba, fearing they might come out and catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree. At last the door opened again, and the Forty Thieves came out. As the Captain went in last he came out first, and made them all pass by him; he then closed the door, saying: "Shut, Sesame!" Every man bridled his horse and mounted, the Captain put himself at their head, and they returned as they came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1502'>(1) Sesame is a kind of grain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1503'>Then Ali Baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes, and said: "Open, Sesame!" and it flew open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich bales of merchandise--silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money in leather purses. He went in and the door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought his asses, which were browsing outside, could carry, loaded them with the bags, and hid it all with fagots. Using the words: "Shut, Sesame!" he closed <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='home' adjectives='' verbs='go;close' valence='6.115' arousal='3.91' dominance='6.035'>the door</entity> and went home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1504'>Then he drove his asses into the yard, shut the gates, carried the money-bags to his wife, and emptied them out before her. He bade her keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold. "Let me first measure it," said his wife. "I will go borrow a measure of someone, while you dig the hole." So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure. Knowing Ali Baba"s poverty, the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure, and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure. Ali Baba"s wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and emptied it often, to her great content. She then carried it back to her sister, without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it, which Cassim"s wife perceived directly her back was turned. She grew very curious, and said to Cassim when he came home: "Cassim, your brother is richer than you. He does not count his money, he measures it." He begged her to explain this riddle, which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it. Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep, and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise. "Ali Baba," he said, showing him the gold piece, "you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold." By this Ali Baba perceived that through his wife"s folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret, so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share. "That I expect," said Cassim; "but I must know where to find the treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you will lose all." Ali Baba, more out of kindness than fear, told him of the cave, and the very words to use. Cassim left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand with him and get the treasure for himself. He rose early next morning, and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests. He soon found the place, and the door in the rock. He said: "Open, Sesame!" and the door opened and shut behind him. He could have feasted his eyes all day on the treasures, but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as possible; but when he was ready to go he could not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches. Instead of "Sesame," he said: "Open, Barley!" and the door remained fast. He named several different sorts of grain, all but the right one, and the door still stuck fast. He was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had never heard it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1505'>About noon the robbers returned to their cave, and saw Cassim"s mules roving about with great chests on their backs. This gave them the alarm; they drew their sabres, and went to the door, which opened on their Captain"s saying: "Open, Sesame!" Cassim, who had heard the trampling of their horses" feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down. In vain, however, for the robbers with their sabres soon killed him. On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready, and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret. They cut <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;search;treasure;anyone;s;venture;order' adjectives='more' verbs='nail;frighten;cut;go' valence='5.31538461538' arousal='4.45923076923' dominance='5.25692307692'>Cassim</entity>"s body into four quarters, and nailed them up inside <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='body;search;treasure;anyone;s;venture;order' adjectives='more' verbs='nail;frighten;cut;go' valence='5.31538461538' arousal='4.45923076923' dominance='5.25692307692'>the cave</entity>, in order to frighten anyone who should venture in, and went away in search of more treasure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1506'>As night drew on Cassim"s wife grew very uneasy, and ran to her brother-in-law, and told him where her husband had gone. Ali Baba did his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim. The first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. Full of horror, he put the body on one of his asses, and bags of gold on the other two, and, covering all with some fagots, returned home. He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard, and led the other to Cassim"s house. The door was opened by the slave Morgiana, whom he knew to be both brave and cunning. Unloading the ass, he said to her: "This is the body of your master, who has been murdered, but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed. I will speak with you again, but now tell your mistress I am come."

Thus, in the evening, no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim"s wife and Morgiana, telling everyone that Cassim was dead. The day after Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early, put a piece of gold in his hand, and bade him follow her with his needle and thread. Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief, she took him to the room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him sew the quarters together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him home. Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave, weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassim"s wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries. Next day she went to live with <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shop;s;son' adjectives='eldest' verbs='go;live;give' valence='6.59428571429' arousal='4.56428571429' dominance='5.55142857143'>Ali Baba</entity>, who gave <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shop;s;son' adjectives='eldest' verbs='go;live;give' valence='6.59428571429' arousal='4.56428571429' dominance='5.55142857143'>Cassim</entity>"s shop to his eldest son.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1508'>The Forty Thieves, on their return to the cave, were much astonished to find Cassim"s body gone and some of their money-bags. "We are certainly discovered," said the Captain, "and shall be undone if we cannot find out who it is that knows our secret. Two men must have known it; we have killed one, we must now find the other. To this end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler, and discover whom we have killed, and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death. If the messenger fails he must lose his life, lest we be betrayed." One of the thieves started up and offered to do this, and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba Mustapha"s stall. The thief bade him good-day, saying: "Honest man, how can you possibly see to stitch at your age?" "Old as I am," replied the cobbler, "I have very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you that I sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than I have now." The robber was overjoyed at his good fortune, and, giving him a piece of gold, desired to be shown the house where he stitched up the dead body. At first Mustapha refused, saying that he had been blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before. This means succeeded; the robber partly led him, and was partly guided by him, right in front of Cassim"s house, the door of which the robber marked with a piece of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest. By and by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mischief;anything;brewing;mark;chalk;master;door;mistress;piece;side;robber' adjectives='marked' verbs='be;guess;make;say;see;have;go;fetch' valence='5.3305' arousal='4.2345' dominance='5.32'>Morgiana</entity>, going out, saw the mark the robber had made, quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing, and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side, without saying anything to her master or mistress.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1509'>The thief, meantime, told his comrades of his discovery. The Captain thanked him, and bade him show him the house he had marked. But when they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner. The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded for having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba Mustapha, marked the house in red chalk; but Morgiana being again too clever for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain now resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it. He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil. The Captain put one of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel. Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk. The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba"s house, and said to Ali Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness: "I have brought some oil from a distance to sell at to-morrow"s market, but it is now so late that I know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favor to take me in." Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant. He bade him welcome, opened his gates for the mules to enter, and went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest. He brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the Captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules, but really to tell his men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he said to each man: "As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I will be with you in a trice." He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to his chamber. She then told Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in the house. "Do not be uneasy," said Abdallah; "go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars." Morgiana thanked him for his advice, took the oil pot, and went into the yard. When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly: "Is it time?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1510'>Any other slave but Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted, would have screamed and made a noise; but she, knowing the danger her master was in, bethought herself of a plan, and answered quietly: "Not yet, but presently." She went to all the jars, giving the same answer, till she came to the jar of oil. She now saw that her master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight robbers into his house. She filled her oil pot, went back to the kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil. When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside. When this brave deed was done she went back to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='deed;lamp' adjectives='' verbs='be;brave;do;put;see;go;happen;wait' valence='5.67785714286' arousal='3.81428571429' dominance='5.74142857143'>the kitchen</entity>, put out <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='deed;lamp' adjectives='' verbs='be;brave;do;put;see;go;happen;wait' valence='5.67785714286' arousal='3.81428571429' dominance='5.74142857143'>the fire</entity> and the lamp, and waited to see what would happen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1511'>In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up, and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the first jar and saying, "Are you asleep?" he smelt the hot boiled oil, and knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been discovered. He found all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death. He then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden, and climbing over several walls made his escape. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bed;success' adjectives='' verbs='go;rejoice;see;hear;fall' valence='6.1675' arousal='4.1575' dominance='5.7075'>Morgiana</entity> heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1512'>At daybreak Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked why the merchant had not gone with his mules. Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil. Seeing a man, he started back in terror. "Have no fear," said Morgiana; "the man cannot harm you: he is dead." Ali Baba, when he had recovered somewhat from his astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant. "Merchant!" said she, "he is no more a merchant than I am!" and she told him the whole story, assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest, of whom only three were left, and that the white and red chalk marks had something to do with it. Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that he owed her his life. They then buried the bodies in <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;s;slave;garden;mule' adjectives='' verbs='sell;be;bury' valence='4.91' arousal='4.15111111111' dominance='5.10444444444'>Ali Baba</entity>"s garden, while the mules were sold in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='body;s;slave;garden;mule' adjectives='' verbs='sell;be;bury' valence='4.91' arousal='4.15111111111' dominance='5.10444444444'>the market</entity> by his slaves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1513'>The Captain returned to his lonely cave, which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions, and firmly resolved to avenge them by killing Ali Baba. He dressed himself carefully, and went into the town, where he took lodgings in an inn. In the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen, and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba"s son. He called himself Cogia Hassan, and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends with Ali Baba"s son, and through him with Ali Baba, whom he was continually asking to sup with him. Ali Baba, wishing to return his kindness, invited him into his house and received him smiling, thanking him for his kindness to his son. When the merchant was about to take his leave Ali Baba stopped him, saying: "Where are you going, sir, in such haste? Will you not stay and sup with me?" The merchant refused, saying that he had a reason; and, on Ali Baba"s asking him what that was, he replied: "It is, sir, that I can eat no victuals that have any salt in them." "If that is all," said Ali Baba, "let me tell you that there shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat to-night." He went to give this order to Morgiana, who was much surprised. "Who is this man," she said, "who eats no salt with his meat?" "He is an honest man, Morgiana," returned her master; "therefore do as I bid you." But she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man, so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under his garment. "I am not surprised," she said to herself, "that this wicked man, who intends to kill my master, will eat no salt with him; but I will hinder his plans."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1514'>She sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on. When the dessert had been served, Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son, whom he thought to make drunk and then to murder them. Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a head-dress like a dancing-girl"s, and clasped a girdle round her waist, from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt, and said to Abdallah: "Take your tabor, and let us go and divert our master and his guest." Abdallah took his tabor and played before Morgiana until they came to the door, where Abdallah stopped playing and Morgiana made a low courtesy. "Come in, Morgiana," said Ali Baba, "and let Cogia Hassan see what you can do"; and, turning to Cogia Hassan, he said: "She"s my slave and my housekeeper." Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased, for he feared that his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone for the present; but he pretended great eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah began to play and Morgiana to dance. After she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with it, sometimes pointing it at her own breast, sometimes at her master"s, as if it were part of the dance. Suddenly, out of breath, she snatched the tabor from Abdallah with her left hand, and, holding the dagger in her right hand, held out the tabor to her master. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='son;heart;dagger;gold;purse;hand;morgiana;piece' adjectives='' verbs='be;plunge;pull;make;see;put;come' valence='5.8' arousal='4.29684210526' dominance='5.54263157895'>Ali Baba</entity> and his son put a piece of gold into it, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='son;heart;dagger;gold;purse;hand;morgiana;piece' adjectives='' verbs='be;plunge;pull;make;see;put;come' valence='5.8' arousal='4.29684210526' dominance='5.54263157895'>Cogia Hassan</entity>, seeing that she was coming to him, pulled out his purse to make her a present, but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana plunged the dagger into his heart.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1522'>Once upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children; the boy was called Hansel and the girl Grettel. He had always little enough to live on, and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he couldn"t even provide them with daily bread. One night, as he was tossing about in bed, full of cares and worry, he sighed and said to his wife: "What"s to become of us? how are we to support our poor children, now that we have nothing more for ourselves?" "I"ll tell you what, husband," answered the woman; "early to-morrow morning we"ll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood; there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread; then we"ll go on to our work and leave them alone. They won"t be able to find their way home, and we shall thus be rid of them." "No, wife," said her husband, "that I won"t do; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood? The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces." "Oh! you fool," said she, "then we must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well go and plane the boards for our coffins"; and she left him no peace till he consented. "But I can"t help feeling sorry for the poor children," added the husband.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1523'>The children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grettel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel: "Now it"s all up with us." "No, no, Grettel," said Hansel, "don"t fret yourself; I"ll be able to find a way to escape, no fear." And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little coat, opened the back door and stole out. The moon was shining clearly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver. Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in. Then he went back and said to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='god;sister;bed' adjectives='little' verbs='be;comfort;say;sleep;lay;go;desert' valence='6.19857142857' arousal='3.80357142857' dominance='5.83928571429'>Grettel</entity>: "Be comforted, my dear little sister, and go to sleep: God will not desert us"; and he lay down in bed again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1524'>At daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children: "Get up, you lie-abeds, we"re all going to the forest to fetch wood." She gave them each a bit of bread and said: "There"s something for your luncheon, but don"t you eat it up before, for it"s all you"ll get." Grettel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. After they had walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this maneuver he repeated again and again. His father observed him, and said: "Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and why do you always remain behind? Take care, and don"t lose your footing." "Oh! father," said Hansel, "I am looking back at my white kitten, which is sitting on the roof, waving me a farewell." The woman exclaimed: "What a donkey you are! that isn"t your kitten, that"s the morning sun shining on the chimney." But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pocket;pebble;kitten' adjectives='white' verbs='drop;look;have' valence='5.78272727273' arousal='3.48727272727' dominance='5.54181818182'>Hansel</entity> had not looked back at his kitten, but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='pocket;pebble;kitten' adjectives='white' verbs='drop;look;have' valence='5.78272727273' arousal='3.48727272727' dominance='5.54181818182'>the path</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1525'>When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said: "Now, children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and I"ll light a fire that you may not feel cold." Hansel and Grettel heaped up brushwood till they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill. The brushwood was set fire to, and when the flames leaped high the woman said: "Now lie down at the fire, children, and rest yourselves: we are going into the forest to cut down wood; when we"ve finished we"ll come back and fetch you." Hansel and Grettel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little bits of bread. They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was quite near. But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead tree, and that was blown about by the wind. And when they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When they awoke at last it was pitch dark. Grettel began to cry, and said: "How are we ever to get out of the wood?" But Hansel comforted her. "Wait a bit," he said, "till the moon is up, and then we"ll find our way sure enough." And when the full moon had risen he took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles, which shone like new threepenny bits, and showed them the path. They walked on through the night, and at daybreak reached their father"s house again. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it she exclaimed: "You naughty children, what a time you"ve slept in the wood! we thought you were never going to come back." But the father rejoiced, for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1526'>Not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land, and the children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night: "Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the house, and when that"s done it"s all up with us. The children must be got rid of; we"ll lead them deeper into the wood this time, so that they won"t be able to find their way out again. There is no other way of saving ourselves." The man"s heart smote him heavily, and he thought: "Surely it would be better to share the last bite with one"s children!" But his wife wouldn"t listen to his arguments, and did nothing but scold and reproach him. If a man yields once he"s done for, and so, because he had given in the first time, he was forced to do so the second.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1527'>But the children were awake, and had heard the conversation. When the old people were asleep Hansel got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles again, as he had done the first time; but the woman had barred the door, and Hansel couldn"t get out. But he consoled his little sister, and said: "Don"t cry, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='god;sister;cry;don;t' adjectives='little;sure' verbs='sleep;say;console;help;be' valence='6.03363636364' arousal='4.17090909091' dominance='5.50727272727'>Grettel</entity>, and sleep peacefully, for God is sure to help us."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1528'>At early dawn the woman came and made the children get up. They received their bit of bread, but it was even smaller than the time before. On the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground. "Hansel, what are you stopping and looking about you for?" said the father. "I"m looking back at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell," answered Hansel. "Fool!" said the wife; "that isn"t your pigeon, it"s the morning sun glittering on the chimney." But Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before. Then a big fire was lit again, and the mother said: "Just sit down there, children, and if you"re tired you can sleep a bit; we"re going into the forest to cut down wood, and in the evening when we"re finished we"ll come back to fetch you." At midday Grettel divided her bread with Hansel, for he had strewn his all along their path. Then they fell asleep, and evening passed away, but nobody came to the poor children. They didn"t awake till it was pitch dark, and Hansel comforted his sister, saying: "Only wait, Grettel, till the moon rises, then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they will show us the way back to the house." When the moon appeared they got up, but they found no crumbs, for the thousands of birds that fly about the woods and fields had picked them all up. "Never mind," said Hansel to Grettel; "you"ll see we"ll find a way out"; but all the same they did not. They wandered about the whole night, and the next day, from morning till evening, but they could not find a path out of the wood. They were very hungry, too, for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground. And at last they were so tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer, so they lay down under a tree and fell fast asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1529'>On the third morning after they had left their father"s house they set about their wandering again, but only got deeper and deeper into the wood, and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish. At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it. And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them. They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched; and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent sugar. "Now we"ll set to," said Hansel, "and have a regular blow-out.(1) I"ll eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grettel, can eat some of the window, which you"ll find a sweet morsel." Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what it was like, and Grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it. Thereupon a shrill voice called out from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='voice;thereupon' adjectives='shrill' verbs='call' valence='5.312' arousal='4.118' dominance='5.212'>the room</entity> inside:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1533'>and went on eating, without putting themselves about. Hansel, who thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while Grettel pushed out a whole round window-pane, and sat down the better to enjoy it. Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame leaning on a staff hobbled out. Hansel and Grettel were so terrified that they let what they had in their hands fall. But the old woman shook her head and said: "Oh, ho! you dear children, who led you here? Just come in and stay with me, no ill shall befall you." She took them both by the hand and let them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them--milk and sugared pancakes, with apples and nuts.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1535'>The old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an old witch who had waylaid the children, and had only built the little bread house in order to lure them in. When anyone came into her power she killed, cooked, and ate him, and held a regular feast-day for the occasion. Now witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but, like beasts, they have a keen sense of smell, and know when human beings pass by. When Hansel and Grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly: "I"ve got them now; they sha"n"t escape me." Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself: "That"ll be a dainty bite." Then she seized Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and barred the door on him; he might scream as much as he liked, it did him no good. Then she went to Grettel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: "Get up, you lazy-bones, fetch water and cook something for your brother.

But Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose eyes were dim, couldn"t see it, and thinking always it was Hansel"s finger, wondered why he fattened so slowly. When four weeks had passed and Hansel still remained thin, she lost patience and determined to wait no longer. "Hi, Grettel," she called to the girl, "be quick and get some water. Hansel may be fat or thin, I"m going to kill him to-morrow and cook him." Oh! how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears rolled down her cheeks! "Kind heaven help us now!" she cried; "if only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us, then at least we should have died together." "Just hold your peace," said the old hag; "it won"t help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1537'>Early in the morning Grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire. "First we"ll bake," said the old dame; "I"ve heated the oven already and kneaded the dough." She pushed Grettel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. "Creep in," said the witch, "and see if it"s properly heated, so that we can shove in the bread." For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: "I don"t know how I"m to do it; how do I get in?" "You silly goose!" said the hag, "the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself," and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='woman' adjectives='wretched;old;horrible' verbs='leave;be;yell;flee;perish' valence='4.186' arousal='4.445' dominance='4.821'>Grettel</entity> fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.</paragraph>

Then Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened. How they rejoiced, and fell on each other"s necks, and jumped for joy, and kissed one another! And as they had no longer any cause for fear, they went in the old hag"s house, and here they found, in every corner of the room, boxes with pearls and precious stones. "These are even better than pebbles," said Hansel, and crammed his pockets full of them; and Grettel said: "I too will bring something home," and she filled her apron full. "But now," said Hansel, "let"s go and get well away from the witch"s wood." When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake. "We can"t get over," said Hansel; "I see no bridge of any sort or kind."

"No," answered Grettel, "we should be too heavy a load for the duck: she shall carry us across separately." The good bird did this, and when they were landed safely on the other side, and had gone for a while, the wood became more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw their father"s house in the distance. Then they set off to run, and bounding into the room fell on their father"s neck. The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood, but the woman had died. Grettel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled about the room, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket. Thus all their troubles were ended, and they lived happily ever afterward.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1545'>A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red. She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do. The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said, "We will never desert each other," Rose-red answered: "No, not as long as we live"; and the mother added: "Whatever one gets she shall share with the other." They often roamed about in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='leaf;hare;deer;hand;beast;stag;contrary;berry;branch;cabbage;might;bird;manner' adjectives='little;confiding' verbs='offer;bind;gather;remain;hurt;graze;roam;sing;come;eat' valence='5.54074074074' arousal='3.9337037037' dominance='5.57777777778'>the woods</entity> gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them in the most confiding manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1546'>No evil ever befell them; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious about them. Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun, they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly, but said nothing, and vanished into the wood. And when they looked round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a precipice, over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness. And when they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1547'>Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother"s cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it. In summer Rose-red looked after the house, and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each tree a rose. In winter Snow-white lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said: "Snow-white, go and close the shutters," and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span. Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1548'>One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance. The mother said: "Rose-red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveler seeking shelter." Rose-red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the door. Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother"s bed. But the bear began to speak, and said: "Don"t be afraid: I won"t hurt you. I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little." "My poor bear," said the mother, "lie down by the fire, only take care you don"t burn your fur." Then she called out: "Snow-white and Rose-red, come out; the bear will do you no harm; he is a good, honest creature." So they both came out of their hiding-places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life. They tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he growled they only laughed. The bear submitted to everything with the best possible good-nature, only when they went too far he cried: "Oh! children, spare my life!</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1551'>When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: "Now I must go away, and not return again the whole summer." "Where are you going to, dear bear?" asked Snow-white. "I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs. In winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to remain underground, for they can"t work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy the land and steal what they can; what once falls into their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1552'>A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots. They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn"t distinguish. When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long. The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain, and didn"t seem to know what he was to do. He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes, and screamed out: "What are you standing there for? Can"t you come and help me?" "What were you doing, little man?" asked Rose-red. "You stupid, inquisitive goose!" replied the dwarf; "I wanted to split the tree, in order to get little chips of wood for our kitchen fire; those thick logs that serve to make fires for coarse, greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food we need. I had successfully driven in the wedge, and all was going well, but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed up so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white beard out, so here I am stuck fast, and I can"t get away; and you silly, smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! what wretches you are!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1553'>The children did all in their power, but they couldn"t get the beard out; it was wedged in far too firmly. "I will run and fetch somebody," said Rose-red. "Crazy blockheads!" snapped the dwarf; "what"s the good of calling anyone else? You"re already two too many for me. Does nothing better occur to you than that?" "Don"t be so impatient," said Snow-white, "I"ll see you get help," and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: "Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!" With these words he swung the bag over his back, and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1554'>Shortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish. As they approached the stream they saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going to jump in. They ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf. "Where are you going to?" asked Rose-red; "you"re surely not going to jump into the water?" "I"m not such a fool," screamed the dwarf. "Don"t you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?" The little man had been sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line; and when immediately afterward a big fish bit, the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper fin, and dragged the dwarf toward him. He clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of grass, but it didn"t help him much; he had to follow every movement of the fish, and was in great danger of being drawn into the water. The girls came up just at the right moment, held him firm, and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in a hopeless muddle. Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard, by which a small part of it was sacrificed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1555'>When the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: "Do you call that manners, you toad-stools! to disfigure a fellow"s face? It wasn"t enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must now needs cut off the best bit of it. I can"t appear like this before my own people. I wish you"d been in Jericho first." Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1556'>It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there. While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them. Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off. The tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey. When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice: "Couldn"t you have treated me more carefully? You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!" Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave. The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town. On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them. "What are you standing there gaping for?" screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became scarlet with rage. He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in great fright, but he hadn"t time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already close to him. Then he cried in terror: "Dear Mr. Bear, spare me! I"ll give you all my treasure. Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there. Spare my life! what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me? You won"t feel me between your teeth. There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven"s sake." But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1557'>The girls had run away, but the bear called after them: "Snow-white and Rose-red, don"t be afraid; wait, and I"ll come with you." Then they recognized his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all dressed in gold. "I am a king"s son," he said, "and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free. Now he has got his well-merited punishment."</paragraph>

She gave her a waiting-maid also, who was to ride with her and hand her over to the bridegroom, and she provided each of them with a horse for the journey.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1564'>So they took a sad farewell of each other, and the Princess stuck the rag in front of her dress, mounted her horse, and set forth on the journey to her bridegroom"s kingdom. After they had ridden for about an hour the Princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to her waiting-maid: "Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder stream: I would like a drink." "If you"re thirsty," said the maid, "dismount yourself, and lie down by the water and drink; I don"t mean to be your servant any longer." The Princess was so thirsty that she got down, bent over the stream, and drank, for she wasn"t allowed to drink out of the golden goblet. As she drank she murmured: "Oh! heaven, what am I to do?" and the three drops of blood replied:</paragraph>

And as they passed a brook she called once more to her waiting-maid: "Pray get down and give me a drink from my golden cup," for she had long ago forgotten her maid"s rude words. But the waiting-maid replied, more haughtily even than before: "If you want a drink, you can dismount and get it; I don"t mean to be your servant." Then the Princess was compelled by her thirst to get down, and bending over the flowing water she cried and said: "Oh! heaven, what am I to do?" and the three drops of blood replied:</paragraph>

When she wished to get on her horse Falada again, the waiting-maid called out: "I mean to ride Falada: you must mount my beast"; and this too she had to submit to. Then the waiting-maid commanded her harshly to take off her royal robes, and to put on her common ones, and finally she made her swear by heaven not to say a word about the matter when they reached the palace; and if she hadn"t taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot.

In the meantime the real Princess was left standing below in the courtyard.

"Oh!" replied the bride, "I brought her with me to keep me company on the journey; give the girl something to do, that she may not be idle."

The bridegroom sat at the head of the table, the Princess on one side of him and the waiting-maid on the other; but she was so dazzled that she did not recognize the Princess in her glittering garments. Now when they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the old King asked the waiting-maid to solve a knotty point for him. "What," said he, "should be done to a certain person who has deceived everyone?" and he proceeded to relate the whole story, ending up with, "Now what sentence should be passed?"

First of all, you were out of temper because you could not have what you wanted, and you thought all men and animals were only made to do your pleasure; then you were really angry, which is very naughty indeed; and lastly, you were cruel to a poor little animal who did not in the least deserve to be ill-treated.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1654'>"I know you are far above a little dog, but if it were right and allowable that great people should ill-treat all who are beneath them, I might at this moment beat you, or kill you, for a fairy is greater than a man. The advantage of possessing a great empire is not to be able to do the evil that one desires, but to do all the good that one possibly can."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1655'>The Prince saw how naughty he had been, and promised to try and do better in future, but he did not keep his word. The fact was he had been brought up by a foolish nurse, who had spoiled him when he was little. If he wanted anything he only had to cry and fret and stamp his feet and she would give him whatever he asked for, which had made him self-willed; also she had told him from morning to night that he would one day be a king, and that kings were very happy, because everyone was bound to obey and respect them, and no one could prevent them from doing just as they liked.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1656'>When the Prince grew old enough to understand, he soon learned that there could be nothing worse than to be proud, obstinate, and conceited, and he had really tried to cure himself of these defects, but by that time all his faults had become habits; and a bad habit is very hard to get rid of. Not that he was naturally of a bad disposition; he was truly sorry when he had been naughty, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1657'>"I am very unhappy to have to struggle against my anger and pride every day; if I had been punished for them when I was little they would not be such a trouble to me now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1658'>His ring pricked him very often, and sometimes he left off what he was doing at once; but at other times he would not attend to it. Strangely enough, it gave him only a slight prick for a trifling fault, but when he was really naughty it made his finger actually bleed. At last he got tired of being constantly reminded, and wanted to be able to do as he liked, so he threw his ring aside, and thought himself the happiest of men to have got rid of its teasing pricks. He gave himself up to doing every foolish thing that occurred to him, until he became quite wicked and nobody could like him any longer.</paragraph>

Keep her in prison, and feed her on bread and water for a little while, and then, if she still says she will not marry you, have her head cut off, to teach other people that you mean to be obeyed.

At first Prince Darling had thanked him, but after a time he grew impatient and thought it must be just mere love of fault-finding that made his old tutor blame him when everyone else was praising and flattering him. So he ordered him to retire from his Court, though he still, from time to time, spoke of him as a worthy man whom he respected, even if he no longer loved him.

Four of his courtiers, those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings, had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them, but the people, who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the Prince, had cut off their heads, and had offered the crown to Suliman, whom the Prince had left in prison.

Now Trusty John was his favorite servant, and was so called because all his life he had served him so faithfully. When he approached the bed the King spake to him: "Most trusty John, I feel my end is drawing near, and I could face it without a care were it not for my son. He is still too young to decide everything for himself, and unless you promise me to instruct him in all he should know, and to be to him as a father, I shall not close my eyes in peace." Then Trusty John answered: "I will never desert him, and will serve him faithfully, even though it should cost me my life." Then the old King said: "Now I die comforted and in peace"; and then he went on: "After my death you must show him the whole castle, all the rooms and apartments and vaults, and all the treasures that lie in them; but you must not show him the last room in the long passage, where the picture of the Princess of the Golden Roof is hidden.

So he took him over everything, and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments, only the one room where the picture was he did not open. But the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it, and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved, and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world. But the young King noticed that Trusty John always missed one door, and said: "Why do you never open this one for me?" "There is something inside that would appall you," he answered. But the King replied: "I have seen the whole castle, and shall find out what is in there"; and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open. But Trusty John held him back, and said: "I promised your father before his death that you shouldn"t see what that room contains. It might bring both you and me to great grief." "Ah! no," answered the young King; "if I don"t get in, it will be my certain destruction; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what was in the room with my own eyes.

When he had opened the door he stepped in first, and thought to cover the likeness so that the King might not perceive it; but it was hopeless: the King stood on tiptoe and looked over his shoulder. And when he saw the picture of the maid, so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones, he fell swooning to the ground. Trusty John lifted him up, carried him to bed, and thought sorrowfully: "The curse has come upon us; gracious heaven! what will be the end of it all?" Then he poured wine down his throat till he came to himself again. The first words he spoke were: "Oh! who is the original of the beautiful picture?" "She is the Princess of the Golden Roof," answered Trusty John. Then the King continued: "My love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they could not express it; my very life depends on my winning her. You are my most trusty John: you must stand by me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1773'>The faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the matter, for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of the Princess. At length he hit upon a plan, and spoke to the King: "All the things she has about her--tables, chairs, dishes, goblets, bowls, and all her household furniture--are made of gold. You have in your treasure five tons of gold; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels, into all sorts of birds and game and wonderful beasts; that will please her. We shall go to her with them and try our luck." The King summoned all his goldsmiths, and they had to work hard day and night, till at length the most magnificent things were completed. When a ship had been laden with them the faithful John disguised himself as a merchant, and the King had to do the same, so that they should be quite unrecognizable. And so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='golden;roof;sea;dwelt' adjectives='' verbs='journey;reach;cross' valence='6.27' arousal='3.87125' dominance='5.705'>the town</entity> where the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='golden;roof;sea;dwelt' adjectives='' verbs='journey;reach;cross' valence='6.27' arousal='3.87125' dominance='5.705'>Princess</entity> of the Golden Roof dwelt.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1774'>Trusty John made the King remain behind on the ship and await his return. "Perhaps," he said, "I may bring the Princess back with me, so see that everything is in order; let the gold ornaments be arranged and the whole ship decorated." Then he took a few of the gold things in his apron, went ashore, and proceeded straight to the palace. When he came to the courtyard he found a beautiful maiden standing at the well, drawing water with two golden pails. And as she was about to carry away the glittering water she turned round and saw the stranger, and asked him who he was. Then he replied: "I am a merchant," and opening his apron, he let her peep in. "Oh! my," she cried; "what beautiful gold wares!" she set down her pails, and examined one thing after the other. Then she said: "The Princess must see this, she has such a fancy for gold things that she will buy up all you have." She took him by the hand and let him into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='maid;s;hand' adjectives='' verbs='be;let;take' valence='5.78' arousal='3.94375' dominance='5.5925'>the palace</entity>, for she was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='maid;s;hand' adjectives='' verbs='be;let;take' valence='5.78' arousal='3.94375' dominance='5.5925'>the lady</entity>"s maid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1775'>When the Princess had seen the wares she was quite enchanted, and said: "They are all so beautifully made that I shall buy everything you have." But Trusty John said: "I am only the servant of a rich merchant, what I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship; his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before." She desired to have everything brought up to her, but he said: "There is such a quantity of things that it would take many days to bring them up, and they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house." Thus her desire and curiosity were excited to such an extent that at last she said: "Take me to your ship; I shall go there myself and view your master"s treasures."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1776'>Then Trusty John was quite delighted, and brought her to the ship; and the King, when he beheld her, saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture, and thought every moment that his heart would burst. She stepped on to the ship, and the King led her inside. But Trusty John remained behind with the steersman, and ordered the ship to push off. "Spread all sail, that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air." Meanwhile the King showed the Princess inside all his gold wares, every single bit of it--dishes, goblets, bowls, the birds and game, and all the wonderful beasts. Many hours passed thus, and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away. After she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home; but when she came to the ship"s side she saw that they were on the high seas, far from land, and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas. "Oh!" she cried in terror, "I am deceived, carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!" But the King seized her hand and spake: "I am no merchant, but a king of as high birth as yourself; and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem. The first time I saw your likeness I fell to the ground in a swoon." When the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='golden;wife;roof;heart' adjectives='' verbs='be;consent;comfort;hear;go;become' valence='6.61090909091' arousal='4.03' dominance='6.07909090909'>Princess</entity> of the Golden Roof heard this she was comforted, and her heart went out to him, so that she willingly consented to become his wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1777'>Now it happened one day, while they were sailing on the high seas, that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him. He ceased playing, and listened to what they were saying, for he understood their language. The one croaked: "Ah, ha! so he"s bringing the Princess of the Golden Roof home." "Yes," answered the second, "but he"s not got her yet." "Yes, he has," spake the third, "for she"s sitting beside him on the ship." Then number one began again and cried: "That"ll not help him! When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them: the King will wish to mount it, and if he does it will gallop away with him, and disappear into the air, and he will never see his bride again." "Is there no escape for him?" asked number two. "Oh! yes, if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster, then the young King is saved. But who"s to do that? And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees." Then spake number two: "I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones." Number three asked: "Is there no way of escape, then?" "Oh! yes," answered number two: "If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved. But what"s the good? Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart." Then number three spake: "I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King hasn"t even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet." When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life. At last he said: "I will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1778'>Now when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had predicted, and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward. "Capital!" said the King; "this animal shall carry me to my palace," and was about to mount, but Trusty John was too sharp for him, and, springing up quickly, seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead. Then the other servants of the King, who at no time looked favorably on Trusty John, cried out: "What a sin to kill the beautiful beast that was to bear the King to his palace!" But the King spake: "Silence! let him alone; he is ever my most trusty John. Who knows for what good end he may have done this thing?" So they went on their way and entered the palace, and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the ready-made bridal shirt, looking for all the world as though it were made of gold and silver. The young King went toward it and was about to take hold of it, but Trusty John, pushing him aside, seized it with his gloved hands, threw it hastily into the fire, and let it burn The other servants commenced grumbling again, and said: "See, he"s actually burning the King"s bridal shirt." But the young King spoke: "Who knows for what good purpose he does it? Let him alone, he is my most trusty John." Then the wedding was celebrated, the dance began, and the bride joined in, but Trusty John watched her countenance carefully. Of a sudden she grew deadly white, and fell to the ground as if she were dead. He at once sprang hastily toward her, lifted her up, and bore her to a room, where he laid her down, and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side, and spat them out. She soon breathed again and came to herself; but the young King had watched the proceeding, and not knowing why Trusty John had acted as he did, he flew into a passion, and cried: "Throw him into prison." On the following morning sentence was passed on Trusty John, and he was condemned to be hanged. As he stood on the gallows he said: "Every one doomed to death has the right to speak once before he dies; and I too have that privilege?" "Yes," said the King, "it shall be granted to you." So Trusty John spoke: "I am unjustly condemned, for I have always been faithful to you"; and he proceeded to relate how he had heard the ravens" conversation on the sea, and how he had to do all he did in order to save his master. Then the King cried: "Oh! my most trusty John, pardon! pardon! Take him down." But as he uttered the last word Trusty <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stone;word;trusty;ground' adjectives='lifeless;last' verbs='utter;be;have;fall' valence='4.998' arousal='3.741' dominance='5.331'>John</entity> had fallen lifeless to the ground, and was a stone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1779'>The King and Queen were in despair, and the King spake: "Ah! how ill have I rewarded such great fidelity!" and made them lift up the stone image and place it in his bedroom near his bed. As often as he looked at it he wept and said: "Oh! if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!" After a time the Queen gave birth to twins, two small sons, who throve and grew, and were a constant joy to her. One day when the Queen was at church, and the two children sat and played with their father, he gazed again full of grief on the stone statue, and sighing, wailed: "Oh, if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!" Suddenly the stone began to speak, and said: "Yes, you can restore me to life again if you are prepared to sacrifice what you hold most dear." And the King cried out: "All I have in the world will I give up for your sake." The stone continued: "If you cut off with your own hand the heads of your two children, and smear me with their blood, I shall come back to life." The King was aghast when he heard that he had himself to put his children to death; but when he thought of Trusty John"s fidelity, and how he had even died for him, he drew his sword, and with his own hand cut the heads off his children. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, life came back, and Trusty John stood once more safe and sound before him. He spake to the King: "Your loyalty shall be rewarded," and taking up the heads of the children, he placed them on their bodies, smeared the wounds with their blood, and in a minute they were all right again and jumping about as if nothing had happened. Then the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming, he hid Trusty John and the two children in a big cupboard. As she entered he said to her: "Did you pray in church?" "Yes," she answered, "but my thoughts dwelt constantly on Trusty John, and of what he has suffered for us." Then he spake: "Dear wife, we can restore him to life, but the price asked is our two little sons; we must sacrifice them." The Queen grew white and her heart sank, but she replied: "We owe it to him on account of his great fidelity." Then he rejoiced that she was of the same mind as he had been, and going forward he opened the cupboard, and fetched the two children and Trusty John out, saying: "God be praised! Trusty John is free once more, and we have our two small sons again." Then he related to her all that had passed, and they lived together happily ever afterward.(1)</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1782'>THE BRAVE LITTLE TAILOR</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1783'>One summer"s day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in the best of spirits, and sewed for dear life. As he was sitting thus a peasant woman came down the street, calling out: "Good jam to sell, good jam to sell." This sounded sweetly in the tailor"s ears; he put his frail little head out of the window, and shouted: "up here, my good woman, and you"ll find a willing customer." The woman climbed up the three flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor"s room, and he made her spread out all the pots in a row before him. He examined them all, lifted them up and smelled them, and said at last: "This jam seems good, weigh me four ounces of it, my good woman; and even if it"s a quarter of a pound I won"t stick at it." The woman, who had hoped to find a good market, gave him what he wanted, but went away grumbling wrathfully. "Now heaven shall bless this jam for my use," cried the little tailor, "and it shall sustain and strengthen me." He fetched some bread out of a cupboard, cut a round off the loaf, and spread the jam on it. "That won"t taste amiss," he said; "but I"ll finish that waistcoat first before I take a bite." He placed the bread beside him, went on sewing, and out of the lightness of his heart kept on making his stitches bigger and bigger. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to the ceiling, where heaps of flies were sitting, and attracted them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses. "Ha! who invited you?" said the tailor, and chased the unwelcome guests away. But the flies, who didn"t understand English, refused to let themselves be warned off, and returned again in even greater numbers. At last the little tailor, losing all patience, reached out of his chimney corner for a duster, and exclaiming: "Wait, and I"ll give it to you," he beat them mercilessly with it. When he left off he counted the slain, and no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretched legs. "What a desperate fellow I am!" said he, and was filled with admiration at his own courage. "The whole town must know about this"; and in great haste the little tailor cut out a girdle, hemmed it, and embroidered on it in big letters, "Seven at a blow." "What did I say, the town? no, the whole world shall hear of it," he said; and his heart beat for joy as a lamb wags his tail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1784'>The tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into the wide world, for he considered his workroom too small a field for his prowess. Before he set forth he looked round about him, to see if there was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey; but he found nothing except an old cheese, which he took possession of. In front of the house he observed a bird that had been caught in some bushes, and this he put into his wallet beside the cheese. Then he went on his way merrily, and being light and agile he never felt tired. His way led up a hill, on the top of which sat a powerful giant, who was calmly surveying the landscape. The little tailor went up to him, and greeting him cheerfully said: "Good-day, friend; there you sit at your ease viewing the whole wide world. I"m just on my way there. What do you say to accompanying me?" The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: "What a poor wretched little creature you are!" "That"s a good joke," answered the little tailor, and unbuttoning his coat he showed the giant the girdle. "There now, you can read what sort of a fellow I am." The giant read: "Seven at a blow"; and thinking they were human beings the tailor had slain, he conceived a certain respect for the little man. But first he thought he"d test him, so taking up a stone in his hand, he squeezed it till some drops of water ran out. "Now you do the same," said the giant, "if you really wish to be thought strong." "Is that all?" said the little tailor; "that"s child"s play to me," so he dived into his wallet, brought out the cheese, and pressed it till the whey ran out. "My squeeze was in sooth better than yours," said he. The giant didn"t know what to say, for he couldn"t have believed it of the little fellow. To prove him again, the giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardly follow it. "Now, my little pigmy, let me see you do that." "Well thrown," said the tailor; "but, after all, your stone fell to the ground; I"ll throw one that won"t come down at all." He dived into his wallet again, and grasping the bird in his hand, he threw it up into the air. The bird, enchanted to be free, soared up into the sky, and flew away never to return. "Well, what do you think of that little piece of business, friend?" asked the tailor. "You can certainly throw," said the giant; "but now let"s see if you can carry a proper weight." With these words he led the tailor to a huge oak tree which had been felled to the ground, and said: "If you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the wood." "Most certainly," said the little tailor: "just you take the trunk on your shoulder; I"ll bear the top and branches, which is certainly the heaviest part." The giant laid the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor sat at his ease among the branches; and the giant, who couldn"t see what was going on behind him, had to carry the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain. There he sat behind in the best of spirits, lustily whistling a tune, as if carrying the tree were mere sport. The giant, after dragging the heavy weight for some time, could get on no further, and shouted out: "Hi! I must let the tree fall." The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lout;tree;fancy;hand;tailor;way' adjectives='big;able;whole' verbs='be;seize;spring;say;have;carry' valence='6.071' arousal='3.991' dominance='5.766'>the tree</entity> with both hands as if he had carried it the whole way and said to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lout;tree;fancy;hand;tailor;way' adjectives='big;able;whole' verbs='be;seize;spring;say;have;carry' valence='6.071' arousal='3.991' dominance='5.766'>the giant</entity>: "Fancy a big lout like you not being able to carry a tree!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1785'>They continued to go on their way together, and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruit hung, gave the branches into the tailor"s hand, and bade him eat. But the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down, and when the giant let go the tree swung back into the air, bearing the little tailor with it. When he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself, the giant said: "What! do you mean to tell me you haven"t the strength to hold down a feeble twig?" "It wasn"t strength that was wanting," replied the tailor; "do you think that would have been anything for a man who has killed seven at a blow? I jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us. Do you do the like if you dare." <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tailor;attempt;couldn;branch;t' adjectives='better;little' verbs='make;stick;have;get' valence='5.72166666667' arousal='3.98833333333' dominance='5.63666666667'>The giant</entity> made an attempt, but couldn"t get over <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tailor;attempt;couldn;branch;t' adjectives='better;little' verbs='make;stick;have;get' valence='5.72166666667' arousal='3.98833333333' dominance='5.63666666667'>the tree</entity>, and stuck fast in the branches, so that here too the little tailor had the better of him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1786'>"Well, you"re a fine fellow, after all," said the giant; "come and spend the night with us in our cave." The little tailor willingly consented to do this, and following his friend they went on till they reached a cave where several other giants were sitting round a fire, each holding a roast sheep in his hand, of which he was eating. The little tailor looked about him, and thought: "Yes, there"s certainly more room to turn round in here than in my workshop." The giant showed him a bed and bade him lie down and have a good sleep. But the bed was too big for the little tailor, so he didn"t get into it, but crept away into the corner. At midnight, when the giant thought the little tailor was fast asleep, he rose up, and taking his big iron walking-stick, he broke the bed in two with a blow, and thought he had made an end of the little grasshopper. At early dawn the giants went off to the wood, and quite forgot about the little tailor, till all of a sudden they met him trudging along in the most cheerful manner. The giants were terrified at the apparition, and, fearful lest he should slay them, they all took to their heels as fast as they could.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1787'>The little tailor continued to follow his nose, and after he had wandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. While he lay there the people came, and looking him all over read on his girdle: "Seven at a blow." "Oh!" they said, "what can this great hero of a hundred fights want in our peaceful land? He must indeed be a mighty man of valor." They went and told the King about him, and said what a weighty and useful man he"d be in time of war, and that it would be well to secure him at any price. This counsel pleased the King, and he sent one of his courtiers down to the little tailor, to offer him, when he awoke, a commission in their army. The messenger remained standing by the sleeper, and waited till he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, when he tendered his proposal. "That"s the very thing I came here for," he answered; "I am quite ready to enter the King"s service." So he was received with all honor, and given a special house of his own to live in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1788'>But the other officers resented the success of the little tailor, and wished him a thousand miles away. "What"s to come of it all?" they asked each other; "if we quarrel with him, he"ll let out at us, and at every blow seven will fall. There"ll soon be an end of us." So they resolved to go in a body to the King, and all to send in their papers. "We are not made," they said, "to hold out against a man who kills seven at a blow." The King was grieved at the thought of losing all his faithful servants for the sake of one man, and he wished heartily that he had never set eyes on him, or that he could get rid of him. But he didn"t dare to send him away, for he feared he might kill him along with his people, and place himself on the throne. He pondered long and deeply over the matter, and finally came to a conclusion. He sent to the tailor and told him that, seeing what a great and warlike hero he was, he was about to make him an offer. In a certain wood of his kingdom there dwelled two giants who did much harm; by the way they robbed, murdered, burned, and plundered everything about them; "no one could approach them without endangering his life. But if he could overcome and kill these two giants he should have his only daughter for a wife, and half his kingdom into the bargain; he might have a hundred horsemen, too, to back him up." "That"s the very thing for a man like me," thought the little tailor; "one doesn"t get the offer of a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day." "Done with you," he answered; "I"ll soon put an end to the giants. But I haven"t the smallest need of your hundred horsemen; a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not be afraid of two."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1789'>The little tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When he came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers: "You wait here, I"ll manage the giants by myself"; and he went on into the wood, casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him. After a while he spied the two giants lying asleep under a tree, and snoring till the very boughs bent with the breeze. The little tailor lost no time in filling his wallet with stones, and then climbed up the tree under which they lay. When he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a branch till he sat just above the sleepers, when he threw down one stone after the other on the nearest giant. The giant felt nothing for a long time, but at last he woke up, and pinching his companion said: "What did you strike me for?" "I didn"t strike you," said the other, "you must be dreaming." They both lay down to sleep again, and the tailor threw down a stone on the second giant, who sprang up and cried: "What"s that for? Why did you throw something at me?" "I didn"t throw anything," growled the first one. They wrangled on for a time, till, as both were tired, they made up the matter and fell asleep again. The little tailor began his game once more, and flung the largest stone he could find in his wallet with all his force, and hit the first giant on the chest. "This is too much of a good thing!" he yelled, and springing up like a madman, he knocked his companion against the tree till he trembled. He gave, however, as good as he got, and they became so enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them, till they both fell dead at once on the ground. Then the little tailor jumped down. "It"s a mercy," he said, "that they didn"t root up the tree on which I was perched, or I should have had to jump like a squirrel on to another, which, nimble though I am, would have been no easy job." He drew his sword and gave each of the giants a very fine thrust or two on the breast, and then went to the horsemen and said: "The deed is done, I"ve put an end to the two of them; but I assure you it has been no easy matter, for they even tore up trees in their struggle to defend themselves; but all that"s of no use against one who slays seven men at a blow." "Weren"t you wounded?" asked the horsemen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1790'>"No fear," answered the tailor; "they haven"t touched a hair of my head." But the horsemen wouldn"t believe him till they rode into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='giant;tree;blood;root;horseman;t' adjectives='' verbs='wouldn;lie;tear;ride;welter;believe;find' valence='5.32333333333' arousal='4.21916666667' dominance='5.64083333333'>the wood</entity> and found the giants weltering in their blood, and the trees lying around, torn up by the roots.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1791'>The little tailor now demanded the promised reward from the King, but he repented his promise, and pondered once more how he could rid himself of the hero. "Before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half my kingdom," he said to him, "you must do another deed of valor. A unicorn is running about loose in the wood, and doing much mischief; you must first catch it." "I"m even less afraid of one unicorn than of two giants; seven at a blow, that"s my motto." He took a piece of cord and an axe with him, went out to the wood, and again told the men who had been sent with him to remain outside. He hadn"t to search long, for the unicorn soon passed by, and, on perceiving the tailor, dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot. "Gently, gently," said he, "not so fast, my friend"; and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near, when he sprang lightly behind a tree; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree, and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again, and was thus successfully captured. "Now I"ve caught my bird," said the tailor, and he came out from behind <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cord;neck;horn;beast;everything;tailor;axe;order;bird;round' adjectives='' verbs='be;lead;strike;say;place;catch;come' valence='5.65857142857' arousal='4.03714285714' dominance='5.53857142857'>the tree</entity>, placed the cord round its neck first, then struck the horn out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cord;neck;horn;beast;everything;tailor;axe;order;bird;round' adjectives='' verbs='be;lead;strike;say;place;catch;come' valence='5.65857142857' arousal='4.03714285714' dominance='5.53857142857'>the tree</entity> with his axe, and when everything was in order led the beast before <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cord;neck;horn;beast;everything;tailor;axe;order;bird;round' adjectives='' verbs='be;lead;strike;say;place;catch;come' valence='5.65857142857' arousal='4.03714285714' dominance='5.53857142857'>the King</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1792'>Still the King didn"t want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand. The tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood; and he might have the huntsmen to help him. "Willingly," said the tailor; "that"s mere child"s play." But he didn"t take the huntsmen into the wood with him, and they were well enough pleased to remain behind, for the wild boar had often received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further acquaintance. As soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth, and tried to knock him down; but our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near, and got out of the window again with a jump. The boar pursued him into the church, but the tailor skipped round to the door, and closed it securely. So the raging beast was caught, for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window. The little tailor summoned the huntsmen together, that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. Then the hero betook himself to the King, who was obliged now, whether he liked it or not, to keep his promise, and hand him over his daughter and half his kingdom. Had he known that no hero-warrior, but only a little tailor stood before him, it would have gone even more to his heart. So the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy, and the tailor became a king.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1793'>After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep: "My lad, make that waistcoat and patch these trousers, or I"ll box your ears." Thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had been born, and next day she poured forth her woes to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor less than a tailor. The King comforted her, and said: "Leave your bedroom door open to-night, my servants shall stand outside, and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter, bind him fast, and carry him on to a ship, which shall sail away out into the wide ocean." The Queen was well satisfied with the idea, but the armor-bearer, who had overheard everything, being much attached to his young master, went straight to him and revealed the whole plot. "I"ll soon put a stop to the business," said the tailor. That night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again. The little tailor, who had only pretended to be asleep, began to call out in a clear voice: "My lad, make that waistcoat and patch those trousers, or I"ll box your ears. I have killed seven at a blow, slain two giants, led a unicorn captive, and caught a wild boar, then why should I be afraid of those men standing outside my door?" The men, when they heard the tailor saying these words, were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by a wild army, and didn"t dare go near him again. So the little tailor was and remained a king all the days of his life.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1799'>But my good master Bates died two years after; and as I had few friends my business began to fail, and I determined to go again to sea. After several voyages, I accepted an offer from Captain W. Pritchard, master of the "Antelope," who was making a voyage to the South Sea.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1800'>But in our passage to the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen"s Land. Twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food, and the rest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship; but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, letting down the boat, got clear of the ship, and we rowed about three leagues, till we could work no longer. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves; and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall. What became of my companions in the boat, or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but I conclude they were all lost. For my part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide; but when I was able to struggle no longer I found myself within my depth. By this time the storm was much abated. I reached the shore at last, about eight o"clock in the evening, and advanced nearly half a mile inland, but could not discover any sign of inhabitants. I was extremely tired, and with the heat of the weather I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, and slept sounder than ever I did in my life for about nine hours. When I woke, it was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but could not; for as I happened to be lying on my back, I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I could only look upward. The sun began to grow hot, and the light hurt my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg, which, advancing gently over my breast, came almost up to my chin, when, bending my eyes downward, I perceived it to be a human creature, not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifted up his hands in admiration. I lay all this while in great uneasiness; but at length, struggling to get loose, I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground; and at the same time, with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them, whereupon there was a great shout, and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which pricked me like so many needles. Moreover, they shot another flight into the air, of which some fell on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain, and then, striving again to get loose, they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first, and some of them tried to stab me with their spears; but by good luck I had on a leather jacket, which they could not pierce. By this time I thought it most prudent to lie still till night, when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself; and as for the inhabitants, I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I saw. When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows, but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased; and about four yards from me, for more than an hour, there was a knocking, like people at work. Then, turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me, I saw a stage set up, about a foot and a half from the ground, with two or three ladders to mount it. From this, one of them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech, of which I could not understand a word, though I could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me, and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness. I answered in few words, but in the most submissive manner; and, being almost famished with hunger, I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food. He understood me very well, and, descending from the stage, commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides, on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food, which had been sent by the King"s orders when he first received tidings of me. There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time. They supplied me as fast as they could, with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite. I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink. They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me, and, being a most ingenious people, they slung up one of their largest hogsheads, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top. I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a pint. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me. However, I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals, who ventured to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was free, without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them. After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency, having mounted my right leg, advanced to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue, and spoke about ten minutes, often pointing forward, which, as I afterward found, was toward the capital city, about half a mile distant, whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed. I made a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his Excellency"s head, for fear of hurting him or his train), to show that I desired my liberty. He seemed to understand me well enough, for he shook his head, though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Then I once more thought of attempting to escape; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands, which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased. Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment, which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows. The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy, and presently I fell asleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was told afterward; and it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor"s orders, had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine.</paragraph>

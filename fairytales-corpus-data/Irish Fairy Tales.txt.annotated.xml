	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='18'>CHAPTER I</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='19'>Finnian, the Abbott of Moville, went southwards and eastwards in great haste. News had come to him in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='province;news;man;god;people' adjectives='saintly;own' verbs='be;do;approve;treat;have;believe;come' valence='5.974375' arousal='4.061875' dominance='5.85'>Donegal</entity> that there were yet people in his own province who believed in gods that he did not approve of, and the gods that we do not approve of are treated scurvily, even by saintly men.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>u"He was told of a powerful gentleman who observed neither Saint"s day nor Sunday."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'>"A powerful person!" said Finnian.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='22'>"All that," was the reply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='23'>"We shall try this person\"s power," said Finnian.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='24'>"He is reputed to be a wise and hardy man," said his informant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='25'>"We shall test his wisdom and his hardihood."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='26'>"He is," that gossip whispered--"he is a magician."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='27'>"I will magician him," cried Finnian angrily. "Where does that man live?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='28'>He was informed, and he proceeded to that direction without delay.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='29'>In no great time he came to the stronghold of the gentleman who followed ancient ways, and he demanded admittance in order that he might preach and prove the new God, and exorcise and terrify and banish even the memory of the old one; for to a god grown old Time is as ruthless as to a beggarman grown old.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='30'>But the Ulster gentleman refused Finnian admittance. He barricaded his house, he shuttered his windows, and in a gloom of indignation and protest he continued the practices of ten thousand years, and would not hearken to Finnian calling at the window or to Time knocking at his door.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='31'>But of those adversaries it was the first he redoubted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='32'>Finnian loomed on him as a portent and a terror; but he had no fear of Time. Indeed he was the foster-brother of Time, and so disdainful of the bitter god that he did not even disdain him; he leaped over the scythe, he dodged under it, and the sole occasions on which Time laughs is when he chances on <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='disdain;god;chance;son;scythe;foster-brother;occasion' adjectives='disdainful;bitter;sole' verbs='dodge;be;leap;laugh;do' valence='5.5575' arousal='4.238125' dominance='5.19375'>Tuan</entity>, the son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='disdain;god;chance;son;scythe;foster-brother;occasion' adjectives='disdainful;bitter;sole' verbs='dodge;be;leap;laugh;do' valence='5.5575' arousal='4.238125' dominance='5.19375'>Cairill</entity>, the son of Muredac Red-neck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='33'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='34'>CHAPTER II</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='35'>Now Finnian could not abide that any person should resist both the Gospel and himself, and he proceeded to force the stronghold by peaceful but powerful methods. He fasted on the gentleman, and he did so to such purpose that he was admitted to the house; for to an hospitable heart the idea that a stranger may expire on your doorstep from sheer famine cannot be tolerated. The gentleman, however, did not give in without a struggle: he thought that when Finnian had grown sufficiently hungry he would lift the siege and take himself off to some place where he might get food. But he did not know Finnian. The great abbot sat down on a spot just beyond the door, and composed himself to all that might follow from his action. He bent his gaze on the ground between his feet, and entered into a meditation from which he would Only be released by admission or death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='36'>The first day passed quietly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='37'>Often the gentleman would send a servitor to spy if that deserter of the gods was still before his door, and each time the servant replied that he was still there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='38'>"He will be gone in the morning," said the hopeful master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='39'>On the morrow the state of siege continued, and through that day the servants were sent many times to observe through spy-holes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='40'>"Go," he would say, "and find out if the worshipper of new gods has taken himself away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='41'>But the servants returned each time with the same information.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='42'>"The new druid is still there," they said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>u"All through that day no one could leave the stronghold. And the enforced seclusion wrought on the minds of the servants, while the cessation of all work banded them together in small groups that whispered and discussed and disputed. Then these groups would disperse to peep through the spy-hole at the patient, immobile figure seated before the door, wrapped in a meditation that was timeless and unconcerned. They took fright at the spectacle, and once or twice a woman screamed hysterically, and was bundled away with a companion"s hand clapped on her mouth, so that the ear of their master should not be affronted."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='44'>"He has his own troubles," they said. "It is a combat of the gods that is taking place."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>So much for the women; but the men also were uneasy. They prowled up and down, tramping from the spy-hole to the kitchen, and from the kitchen to the turreted roof. And from the roof they would look down on the motionless figure below, and speculate on many things, including the staunchness of man, the qualities of their master, and even the possibility that the new gods might be as powerful as the old. From these peepings and discussions they would return languid and discouraged.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='46'>"If," said one irritable guard, "if we buzzed a spear at the persistent stranger, or if one slung at him with a jagged pebble!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='47'>"What!" his master demanded wrathfully, "is a spear to be thrown at an unarmed stranger? And from this house!" And he soundly cuffed that indelicate servant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='48'>"Be at peace all of you," he said, "for hunger has a whip, and he will drive the stranger away in the night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>The household retired to wretched beds; but for the master of the house there was no sleep. He marched his halls all night, going often to the spy-hole to see if that shadow was still sitting in the shade, and pacing thence, tormented, preoccupied, refusing even the nose of his favourite dog as it pressed lovingly into his closed palm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='50'>On the morrow he gave in.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>The great door was swung wide, and two of his servants carried Finnian into the house, for the saint could no longer walk or stand upright by reason of the hunger and exposure to which he had submitted. But his frame was tough as the unconquerable spirit that dwelt within it, and in no long time he was ready for whatever might come of dispute or anathema.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='52'>Being quite re-established he undertook the conversion of the master of the house, and the siege he laid against that notable intelligence was long spoken of among those who are interested in such things.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='53'>u"He had beaten the disease of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='heart;door;stranger;god;disease;will;s;pupil' adjectives='great;own;latter;persistent' verbs='beat;march;open;have;do' valence='5.36' arousal='4.42368421053' dominance='5.68789473684'>Mugain</entity>; he had beaten his own pupil the great <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;door;stranger;god;disease;will;s;pupil' adjectives='great;own;latter;persistent' verbs='beat;march;open;have;do' valence='5.36' arousal='4.42368421053' dominance='5.68789473684'>Colm Cille</entity>; he beat <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;door;stranger;god;disease;will;s;pupil' adjectives='great;own;latter;persistent' verbs='beat;march;open;have;do' valence='5.36' arousal='4.42368421053' dominance='5.68789473684'>Tuan</entity> also, and just as the latter"s door had opened to the persistent stranger, so his heart opened, and Finnian marched there to do the will of God, and his own will."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='54'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>CHAPTER III</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>One day they were talking together about the majesty of God and His love, for although Tuan had now received much instruction on this subject he yet needed more, and he laid as close a siege on Finnian as Finnian had before that laid on him. But man works outwardly and inwardly. After rest he has energy, after energy he needs repose; so, when we have given instruction for a time, we need instruction, and must receive it or the spirit faints and wisdom herself grows bitter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>Therefore Finnian said: "Tell me now about yourself, dear heart."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>But Tuan was avid of information about the True God. "No, no," he said, "the past has nothing more of interest for me, and I do not wish anything to come between my soul and its instruction; continue to teach me, dear friend and saintly father."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>"I will do that," Finnian replied, "but I must first meditate deeply on you, and must know you well. Tell me your past, my beloved, for a man is his past, and is to be known by it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='60'>But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='forgetfulness;memory;man' adjectives='content' verbs='need;be;let;plead' valence='5.38111111111' arousal='3.88888888889' dominance='5.16888888889'>Tuan</entity> pleaded: "Let the past be content with itself, for man needs forgetfulness as well as memory."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>"My son," said Finnian, "all that has ever been done has been done for the glory of God, and to confess our good and evil deeds is part of instruction; for the soul must recall its acts and abide by them, or renounce them by confession and penitence. Tell me your genealogy first, and by what descent you occupy these lands and stronghold, and then I will examine your acts and your conscience."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='62'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='land;father;son' adjectives='hereditary' verbs='reply;know;be' valence='6.43222222222' arousal='3.68666666667' dominance='5.41111111111'>Tuan</entity> replied obediently: "I am known as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='land;father;son' adjectives='hereditary' verbs='reply;know;be' valence='6.43222222222' arousal='3.68666666667' dominance='5.41111111111'>Tuan</entity>, son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='land;father;son' adjectives='hereditary' verbs='reply;know;be' valence='6.43222222222' arousal='3.68666666667' dominance='5.41111111111'>Cairill</entity>, son of Muredac Red-neck, and these are the hereditary lands of my father."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>The saint nodded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>"I am not as well acquainted with Ulster genealogies as I should be, yet I know something of them. I am by blood a Leinsterman," he continued.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>"Mine is a long pedigree," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mine;pedigree' adjectives='long' verbs='be;murmur' valence='5.69333333333' arousal='3.86666666667' dominance='5.15'>Tuan</entity> murmured.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>Finnian received that information with respect and interest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>"I also," he said, "have an honourable record."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='68'>His host continued: "I am indeed <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='host;brother;son' adjectives='' verbs='be;continue' valence='6.23857142857' arousal='3.75857142857' dominance='5.48285714286'>Tuan</entity>, the son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='host;brother;son' adjectives='' verbs='be;continue' valence='6.23857142857' arousal='3.75857142857' dominance='5.48285714286'>Starn</entity>, the son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='host;brother;son' adjectives='' verbs='be;continue' valence='6.23857142857' arousal='3.75857142857' dominance='5.48285714286'>Sera</entity>, who was brother to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='host;brother;son' adjectives='' verbs='be;continue' valence='6.23857142857' arousal='3.75857142857' dominance='5.48285714286'>Partholon</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>"But," said Finnian in bewilderment, "there is an error here, for you have recited two different genealogies."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='70'>"Different genealogies, indeed," replied <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='genealogy' adjectives='different' verbs='reply;be' valence='5.988' arousal='3.74' dominance='5.736'>Tuan</entity> thoughtfully, "but they are my genealogies."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>"I do not understand this," Finnian declared roundly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='72'>"I am now known as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mac;sera' adjectives='other;old' verbs='be;know;reply' valence='5.88875' arousal='3.545' dominance='5.645'>Tuan mac Cairill</entity>," the other replied, "but in the days of old I was known as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mac;sera' adjectives='other;old' verbs='be;know;reply' valence='5.88875' arousal='3.545' dominance='5.645'>Tuan mac Starn</entity>, mac Sera."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>"The brother of Partholon," the saint gasped.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='74'>"That is my pedigree," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pedigree' adjectives='' verbs='be;say' valence='6.14' arousal='3.98333333333' dominance='5.99'>Tuan</entity> said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='75'>"But," Finnian objected in bewilderment, "<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='flood;bewilderment' adjectives='' verbs='object;come' valence='4.64' arousal='4.32' dominance='5.00333333333'>Partholon</entity> came to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='flood;bewilderment' adjectives='' verbs='object;come' valence='4.64' arousal='4.32' dominance='5.00333333333'>Ireland</entity> not long after the Flood."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='76'>"I came with him," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;come' valence='5.775' arousal='4.0' dominance='6.41'>Tuan</entity> mildly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>The saint pushed his chair back hastily, and sat staring at his host, and as he stared the blood grew chill in his veins, and his hair crept along his scalp and stood on end.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='78'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='79'>CHAPTER IV</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>But Finnian was not one who remained long in bewilderment. He thought on the might of God and he became that might, and was tranquil.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='81'>He was one who loved God and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='heart;person;god;mind;sympathy;theme;interest' adjectives='great' verbs='be;instruct;love;give' valence='6.55923076923' arousal='4.19692307692' dominance='5.92076923077'>Ireland</entity>, and to the person who could instruct him in these great themes he gave all the interest of his mind and the sympathy of his heart.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>"It is a wonder you tell me, my beloved," he said. "And now you must tell me more."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='83'>"What must I tell?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.95' arousal='3.48' dominance='6.29'>Tuan</entity> resignedly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='84'>"Tell me of the beginning of time in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bearing;son;s;time;beginning;\' adjectives='' verbs='tell' valence='6.216' arousal='3.826' dominance='5.004'>Ireland</entity>, and of the bearing of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bearing;son;s;time;beginning;\' adjectives='' verbs='tell' valence='6.216' arousal='3.826' dominance='5.004'>Partholon</entity>, the son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bearing;son;s;time;beginning;\' adjectives='' verbs='tell' valence='6.216' arousal='3.826' dominance='5.004'>Noah</entity>\"s son."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"I have almost forgotten him," said Tuan. "A greatly bearded, greatly shouldered man he was. A man of sweet deeds and sweet ways."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>"Continue, my love," said Finnian.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>"He came to Ireland in a ship. Twenty-four men and twenty-four women came with him. But before that time no man had come to Ireland, and in the western parts of the world no human being lived or moved. As we drew on Ireland from the sea the country seemed like an unending forest. Far as the eye could reach, and in whatever direction, there were trees; and from these there came the unceasing singing of birds. Over all that land the sun shone warm and beautiful, so that to our sea-weary eyes, our wind-tormented ears, it seemed as if we were driving on Paradise.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='88'>"We landed and we heard the rumble of water going gloomily through the darkness of the forest. Following the water we came to a glade where the sun shone and where the earth was warmed, and there <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='city;sun;couple;shone;livelihood;water;glade;earth' adjectives='' verbs='be;make;rest;warm;follow;come' valence='6.50769230769' arousal='3.91615384615' dominance='5.67615384615'>Partholon</entity> rested with his twenty-four couples, and made a city and a livelihood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>"There were fish in the rivers of Eire\", there were animals in her coverts. Wild and shy and monstrous creatures ranged in her plains and forests. Creatures that one could see through and walk through. Long we lived in ease, and we saw new animals grow,--the bear, the wolf, the badger, the deer, and the boar.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>"Partholon\"s people increased until from twenty-four couples there came five thousand people, who lived in amity and contentment although they had no wits."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>"They had no wits!" Finnian commented.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='92'>"They had no need of wits," <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='need;wit' adjectives='' verbs='say;have' valence='6.1175' arousal='4.0825' dominance='5.955'>Tuan</entity> said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>"I have heard that the first-born were mindless," said Finnian. "Continue your story, my beloved."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>"Then, sudden as a rising wind, between one night and a morning, there came a sickness that bloated the stomach and purpled the skin, and on the seventh day all of the race of Partholon were dead, save one man only." "There always escapes one man," said Finnian thoughtfully.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>"And I am that man," his companion affirmed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='96'>u"Tuan shaded his brow with his hand, and he remembered backwards through incredible ages to the beginning of the world and the first days of Eire". And Finnian, with his blood again running chill and his scalp crawling uneasily, stared backwards with him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>CHAPTER V</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>"Tell on, my love," Finnian murmured</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>"I was alone," said Tuan. "I was so alone that my own shadow frightened me. I was so alone that the sound of a bird in flight, or the creaking of a dew-drenched bough, whipped me to cover as a rabbit is scared to his burrow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='101'>"The creatures of the forest scented me and knew I was alone. They stole with silken pad behind my back and snarled when I faced them; the long, grey wolves with hanging tongues and staring eyes chased me to my cleft rock; there was no creature so weak but it might hunt me, there was no creature so timid but it might outface me. And so I lived for two tens of years and two years, until I knew all that a beast surmises and had forgotten all that a man had known.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='102'>"I could pad as gently as any; I could run as tirelessly. I could be invisible and patient as a wild cat crouching among leaves; I could smell danger in my sleep and leap at it with wakeful claws; I could bark and growl and clash with my teeth and tear with them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>"Tell on, my beloved," said Finnian, "you shall rest in God, dear heart."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='104'>"At the end of that time," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;people;barque;couple;son;time;fleet' adjectives='' verbs='neme;say;come;be' valence='5.792' arousal='3.994' dominance='5.504'>Tuan</entity>, "Nemed the son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;people;barque;couple;son;time;fleet' adjectives='' verbs='neme;say;come;be' valence='5.792' arousal='3.994' dominance='5.504'>Agnoman</entity> came to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='end;people;barque;couple;son;time;fleet' adjectives='' verbs='neme;say;come;be' valence='5.792' arousal='3.994' dominance='5.504'>Ireland</entity> with a fleet of thirty-four barques, and in each barque there were thirty couples of people."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='105'>"I have heard it," said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;hear;have' valence='6.15' arousal='3.85666666667' dominance='6.43666666667'>Finnian</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>"My heart leaped for joy when I saw the great fleet rounding the land, and I followed them along scarped cliffs, leaping from rock to rock like a wild goat, while the ships tacked and swung seeking a harbour. There I stooped to drink at a pool, and I saw myself in the chill water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='107'>"I saw that I was hairy and tufty and bristled as a savage boar; that I was lean as a stripped bush; that I was greyer than a badger; withered and wrinkled like an empty sack; naked as a fish; wretched as a starving crow in winter; and on my fingers and toes there were great curving claws, so that I looked like nothing that was known, like nothing that was animal or divine. And I sat by the pool weeping my loneliness and wildness and my stern old age; and I could do no more than cry and lament between the earth and the sky, while the beasts that tracked me listened from behind the trees, or crouched among bushes to stare at me from their drowsy covert.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>"A storm arose, and when I looked again from my tall cliff I saw that great fleet rolling as in a giant\"s hand. At times they were pitched against the sky and staggered aloft, spinning gustily there like wind-blown leaves. Then they were hurled from these dizzy tops to the flat, moaning gulf, to the glassy, inky horror that swirled and whirled between ten waves. At times a wave leaped howling under a ship, and with a buffet dashed it into air, and chased it upwards with thunder stroke on stroke, and followed again, close as a chasing wolf, trying with hammering on hammering to beat in the wide-wombed bottom and suck out the frightened lives through one black gape. A wave fell on a ship and sunk it down with a thrust, stern as though a whole sky had tumbled at it, and the barque did not cease to go down until it crashed and sank in the sand at the bottom of the sea.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>"The night came, and with it a thousand darknesses fell from the screeching sky. Not a round-eyed creature of the night might pierce an inch of that multiplied gloom. Not a creature dared creep or stand. For a great wind strode the world lashing its league-long whips in cracks of thunder, and singing to itself, now in a world-wide yell, now in an ear-dizzying hum and buzz; or with a long snarl and whine it hovered over the world searching for life to destroy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='110'>"And at times, from the moaning and yelping blackness of the sea, there came a sound--thin-drawn as from millions of miles away, distinct as though uttered in the ear like a whisper of confidence--and I knew that a drowning man was calling on his God as he thrashed and was battered into silence, and that a blue-lipped woman was calling on her man as her hair whipped round her brows and she whirled about like a top.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='115'>"I awoke from the dream, and I was that which I had dreamed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='116'>"I stood a while stamping upon a rock, with my bristling head swung high, breathing through wide nostrils all the savour of the world. For I had come marvellously from decrepitude to strength. I had writhed from the bonds of age and was young again. I smelled the turf and knew for the first time how sweet that smelled. And like lightning my moving nose sniffed all things to my heart and separated them into knowledge.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='117'>"Long I stood there, ringing my iron hoof on stone, and learning all things through my nose. Each breeze that came from the right hand or the left brought me a tale. A wind carried me the tang of wolf, and against that smell I stared and stamped. And on a wind there came the scent of my own kind, and at that I belled. Oh, loud and clear and sweet was the voice of the great stag. With what ease my lovely note went lilting. With what joy I heard the answering call. With what delight I bounded, bounded, bounded; light as a bird\"s plume, powerful as a storm, untiring as the sea.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='118'>"Here now was ease in ten-yard springings, with a swinging head, with the rise and fall of a swallow, with the curve and flow and urge of an otter of the sea. What a tingle dwelt about my heart! What a thrill spun to the lofty points of my antlers! How the world was new! How the sun was new! How the wind caressed me!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='119'>"With unswerving forehead and steady eye I met all that came. The old, lone wolf leaped sideways, snarling, and slunk away. The lumbering bear swung his head of hesitations and thought again; he trotted his small red eye away with him to a near-by brake. The stags of my race fled from my rocky forehead, or were pushed back and back until their legs broke under them and I trampled them to death. I was the beloved, the well known, the leader of the herds of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='leader;herd' adjectives='beloved' verbs='be;know' valence='6.458' arousal='3.974' dominance='5.886'>Ireland</entity>.</paragraph>

A proud head hung to the turf then, and the tears of memory rolled from a large, bright eye.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>"At times I drew near, delicately, standing among thick leaves or crouched in long grown grasses, and I stared and mourned as I looked on men. For Nemed and four couples had been saved from that fierce storm, and I saw them increase and multiply until four thousand couples lived and laughed and were riotous in the sun, for the people of Nemed had small minds but great activity. They were savage fighters and hunters.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='122'>"But one time I came, drawn by that intolerable anguish of memory, and all of these people were gone: the place that knew them was silent: in the land where they had moved there was nothing of them but their bones that glinted in the sun.</paragraph>

He picked himself up and ran, and was knocked down, and ran again blindly, butting into trees and stones.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='146'>"Then I grew old, and in my Ulster cave close to the sea I dreamed my dream, and in it I became a salmon. The green tides of ocean rose over me and my dream, so that I drowned in the sea and did not die, for I awoke in deep waters, and I was that which I dreamed. I had been a man, a stag, a boar, a bird, and now I was a fish. In all my changes I had joy and fulness of life. But in the water joy lay deeper, life pulsed deeper. For on land or air there is always something excessive and hindering; as arms that swing at the sides of a man, and which the mind must remember. The stag has legs to be tucked away for sleep, and untucked for movement; and the bird has wings that must be folded and pecked and cared for. But the fish has but one piece from his nose to his tail. He is complete, single and unencumbered. He turns in one turn, and goes up and down and round in one sole movement.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='150'>"I became the king of the salmon, and, with my multitudes, I ranged on the tides of the world. Green and purple distances were under me: green and gold the sunlit regions above. In these latitudes I moved through a world of amber, myself amber and gold; in those others, in a sparkle of lucent blue, I curved, lit like a living jewel: and in these again, through dusks of ebony all mazed with silver, I shot and shone, the wonder of the sea.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='151'>"I saw the monsters of the uttermost ocean go heaving by; and the long lithe brutes that are toothed to their tails: and below, where gloom dipped down on gloom, vast, livid tangles that coiled and uncoiled, and lapsed down steeps and hells of the sea where even the salmon could not go.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='152'>"I knew the sea.

There is no wonder in that, for it is the pup\"s mother teaches it to fight, and women know that fighting is a necessary art although men pretend there are others that are better. These were the women druids, Bovmall and Lia Luachra. It will be wondered why his own mother did not train him in the first natural savageries of existence, but she could not do it. She could not keep him with her for dread of the clann-Morna. The sons of Morna had been fighting and intriguing for a long time to oust her husband, Uail, from the captaincy of the Fianna of Ireland, and they had ousted him at last by killing him. It was the only way they could get rid of such a man; but it was not an easy way, for what Fionn\"s father did not know in arms could not be taught to him even by Morna. Still, the hound that can wait will catch a hare at last, and even Manana\"nn sleeps. Fionn\"s mother was beautiful, long-haired Muirne: so she is always referred to. She was the daughter of Teigue, the son of Nuada from Faery, and her mother was Ethlinn. That is, her brother was Lugh of the Long Hand himself, and with a god, and such a god, for brother we may marvel that she could have been in dread of Morna or his sons, or of any one. But women have strange loves, strange fears, and these are so bound up with one another that the thing which is presented to us is not often the thing that is to be seen.</paragraph>

They saw the food they put into his little frame reproduce itself length-ways and sideways in tough inches, and in springs and energies that crawled at first, and then toddled, and then ran. He had birds for playmates, but all the creatures that live in a wood must have been his comrades. There would have been for little Fionn long hours of lonely sunshine, when the world seemed just sunshine and a sky. There would have been hours as long, when existence passed like a shade among shadows, in the multitudinous tappings of rain that dripped from leaf to leaf in the wood, and slipped so to the ground. He would have known little snaky paths, narrow enough to be filled by his own small feet, or a goat"s; and he would have wondered where they went, and have marvelled again to find that, wherever they went, they came at last, through loops and twists of the branchy wood, to his own door.

The wind too: he would have listened to its thousand voices as it moved in all seasons and in all moods. Perhaps a horse would stray into the thick screen about his home, and would look as solemnly on Fionn as Fionn did on it. Or, coming suddenly on him, the horse might stare, all a-cock with eyes and ears and nose, one long-drawn facial extension, ere he turned and bounded away with manes all over him and hoofs all under him and tails all round him.

He would have scolded the jackdaw, and tried to out-whistle the throstle, and wondered why his pipe got tired when the blackbird\"s didn\"t. There would be flies to be watched, slender atoms in yellow gauze that flew, and filmy specks that flittered, and sturdy, thick-ribbed brutes that pounced like cats and bit like dogs and flew like lightning. He may have mourned for the spider in bad luck who caught that fly. There would be much to see and remember and compare, and there would be, always, his two guardians. The flies change from second to second; one cannot tell if this bird is a visitor or an inhabitant, and a sheep is just sister to a sheep; but the women were as rooted as the house itself.</paragraph>

The hare crouching in the fronds was visible to him, and the fish that swayed in-visibly in the sway and flicker of a green bank.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='644'>EVENING was drawing nigh, and the Fianna-Finn had decided to hunt no more that day. The hounds were whistled to heel, and a sober, homeward march began. For men will walk soberly in the evening, however they go in the day, and dogs will take the mood from their masters. They were pacing so, through the golden-shafted, tender-coloured eve, when a fawn leaped suddenly from covert, and, with that leap, all quietness vanished: the men shouted, the dogs gave tongue, and a furious chase commenced.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='645'>u"Fionn loved a chase at any hour, and, with Bran and Sceo"lan, he outstripped the men and dogs of his troop, until nothing remained in the limpid world but Fionn, the two hounds, and the nimble, beautiful fawn. These, and the occasional boulders, round which they raced, or over which they scrambled; the solitary tree which dozed aloof and beautiful in the path, the occasional clump of trees that hived sweet shadow as a hive hoards honey, and the rustling grass that stretched to infinity, and that moved and crept and swung under the breeze in endless, rhythmic billowings."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='646'>In his wildest moment Fionn was thoughtful, and now, although running hard, he was thoughtful.

There was a question and a statement in those deep eyes, and he could not understand what that question might be, nor what it was they sought to convey. Now and again one of the dogs turned a head in full flight, and stared, not at Fionn, but distantly backwards, over the spreading and swelling plain where their companions of the hunt had disappeared.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='651'>Fionn marvelled. "They do not want the other dogs to hear or to come on this chase," he murmured, and he wondered what might be passing within those slender heads.</paragraph>

The captain stared at her, as he well might, for he had never seen or imagined to see a woman so beautiful as this was.

When he saw her he did not see the world, and when he saw the world without her it was as though he saw nothing, or as if he looked on a prospect that was bleak and depressing. The belling of a stag had been music to Fionn, but when Saeve spoke that was sound enough for him. He had loved to hear the cuckoo calling in the spring from the tree that is highest in the hedge, or the blackbird\"s jolly whistle in an autumn bush, or the thin, sweet enchantment that comes to the mind when a lark thrills out of sight in the air and the hushed fields listen to the song. But his wife\"s voice was sweeter to Fionn than the singing of a lark. She filled him with wonder and surmise. There was magic in the tips of her fingers. Her thin palm ravished him.

From those dark-green surges there gaped at him monstrous and cavernous jaws; and round, wicked, red-rimmed, bulging eyes stared fixedly at the boat. A ridge of inky water rushed foaming mountainously on his board, and behind that ridge came a vast warty head that gurgled and groaned. But at these vile creatures he thrust with his lengthy spear or stabbed at closer reach with a dagger.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1733'>He was not spared one of the terrors which had been foretold. Thus, in the dark thick oak forest he slew the seven hags and buried them in the molten lead which they had heated for him. He climbed an icy mountain, the cold breath of which seemed to slip into his body and chip off inside of his bones, and there, until he mastered the sort of climbing on ice, for each step that he took upwards he slipped back ten steps. Almost his heart gave way before he learned to climb that venomous hill. In a forked glen into which he slipped at night-fall he was surrounded by giant toads, who spat poison, and were icy as the land they lived in, and were cold and foul and savage. At Sliav Saev he encountered the long-maned lions who lie in wait for the beasts of the world, growling woefully as they squat above their prey and crunch those terrified bones. He came on Ailill of the Black Teeth sitting on the bridge that spanned a torrent, and the grim giant was grinding his teeth on a pillar stone. Art drew nigh unobserved and brought him low.</paragraph>

Two young girls came to him then, having a cup in each of their hands, and presented him with the kingly drink, but, remembering the warning which Credl had given him, he drank only from the right-hand cup and escaped the poison. Next he was visited by Delvcaem"s mother, Dog Head, daughter of the King of the Dog Heads, and Morgan"s queen. She was dressed in full armour, and she challenged Art to fight with her."</paragraph>

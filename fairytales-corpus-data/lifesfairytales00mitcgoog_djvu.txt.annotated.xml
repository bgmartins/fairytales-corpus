	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>Jon was a young man, of surpassing  beauty, who went into the world to seek his  fortune. The third day of his journey  brought him to the Village of Brotherly  Love, an enormous settlement covering  manysquare miles, where he met an acquaint-</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='45'>^ THE DROWSY VILLAGE,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='46'>ance ; and he tarried in that colony. It  soon came to pass that he was invited to  a large party in a patrician mansion. He  forthwith attired himself in broadcloth and  fine linen, and danced with the maidens and  properly disported himself. But while so  doing he noticed a plain and somewhat  elderly maiden sitting disconsolately against  the wall, receiving no attention either from  the hostess or the guests. He spoke of  this to the son of the house, who an-  swered :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='47'>" Oh, she\"s of no special importance."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='48'>"But she is a guest,\"* replied Jon, **and  having invited her to your house you can-  not snub her ! **</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>u"** Oh, yes we can ! ** answered the young  man. ** We can do more than that in the  City of Brotherly Love ! *" and he hurried  away for a partner. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='50'>Jon requested the hostess, who seemed  amazed at his folly, to present him to the  solitary damsel. He then danced with her,  and, after bringing rich patties, with salad  and other indigestible devices that are  never eaten at home, he engaged her in  pleasant converse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>She seemed grateful for these attentions,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='54'>and when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='good-night;poppy' adjectives='' verbs='bid;hand;say'>Jon</entity> finally bade her good-night,  she handed him a poppy, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>"Please accept this flower; it possesses  some unusual qualities, among others that of  putting people to sleep, by simply waving  it in their direction. To wake them you  must kiss the sleeper. Good-night."- And  away she went, leaving Jon standing alone  with the flower. Down among the petals  there seemed to be an enormous dewdrop,  but when he shook it off it fell on the  marble pavement like a hard substance and  bounced up again, retaining its shape. Upon  picking it up, he found he had between his  fingers a diamond of exceeding beauty!  Moreover, in its place within the poppy  another had appeared, also of great price  and astounding brilliancy. And when that  in turn was shaken off, yet another took its  place.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='56'>Jon hurried home, and, in feverish haste,  experimented with this desirable flower.  The first ten minutes resulted in a pint of  diamonds. He danced for joy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>" I am rich I ** he cried, " rich without  limit!" The next morning he distributed  the stones among his various pockets and  betook him to a jeweler.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>" How much is this worth ? " he asked,  giving one of them for inspection. The  jeweler, after consulting with his partner,  said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>" We will give you two hundred dollars  for it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>When Jon readily accepted this price for  a five thousand dollar stone, the jewelers  became suspicious, but they paid him the  money and he went away. His reappear-  ance, a few days after, with other stones yet  more precious, and for which he considered  any sum a fair price, confirmed the jewelers  in their worst surmises, and Jon was marched  before a judge. Several pockets crammed  with priceless jewels did not allay suspicion,  and he soon found himself in jail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>They had allowed him to keep the poppy,  as no one examined it, and no one conse-  quently suspected its value.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>On the second day of his imprisonment  he remembered the other qualities of the  poppy, and straightway tried an experiment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>When the jailer came with his noonday  meal, he waved the magic flower toward  him, and, to his delight, the burly warden  closed his eyes and sank gently to the stone  floor of the cell in a peaceful sleep.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>THE DROWSY VILLAGE, 5</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>Jon lost no time in reaching the court-  yard of the jail, but an officer had already  seen him and given the alarm. As several  jailers rushed toward him, he again waved  the poppy, this time in every direction, and  lo ! the various guardians forgot their haste  and fell napping to the earth. Seeing how  beautifully it worked, and noticing the cus-  todians about the gate were becoming  alarmed, he held the poppy high in his hand,  and turning completely around, he cried :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='69'>** Whole city go to sleep ! ** And the  whole city obeyed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='70'>Then he stepped leisurely out into the  street, where all was quiet and reposeful.  Not a being was awake. A policeman  stood leaning against a wall, but he was  dozing calmly. The driver and conductor  of a passing street car, and all the passengers  within, were sound asleep, while the horses,  from force of habit, moved gently as they  slumbered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='71'>u"Jon"s first thought was to quit the city in  the shortest time, and he sped rapidly along.  Turning a corner he almost ran into a stylish  equipage, the footmen, with closed eyelids,  upon the box, the horses lying flat upon  the pavement. He started as he recognized "</paragraph>

In amaze-  ment, he looked enraptured upon this  transformation, for she was now a fresh and  blooming damsel of scarcely twenty sum-  mers. Blushing, as her eyes met his, she  explained that a malicious wizard, disguised  as a cupid, had entered her chamber one  evening just as she was going to a party,  and because she had refused to marry his  son, changed her into a withered spinster,  so to remain until some young man should  voluntarily kiss her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>It is perhaps unnecessary to add  this  being a fairy tale  that they at once fell  deeply in love with each other. Jon kissed  the horses, and, although it came hard, he  also kissed the driver and footman. Then  he and his charming bride were driven rapid-  ly from the drowsy city and lived happily  together ever afterward, reveling in the  endless riches derived from the unfailing  poppy.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>Nightley Hightime was a New England  fairy of Puritan descent, who preferred the  bustle and excitement of city life to the  quieter pleasures of the country. The Gold-  en City of Manhattan being the only set-  tlement in America that offered a metro-  politan existence, it came about that he  spent most of his time there. One after-  noon, as he was floating aimlessly down  Fifth Avenue, invisible to others, but seeing  everything himself, he noticed two beauti-  ful young ladies, who had picked up a kitten  from a doorstep. Each girl, after kissing  the kitten and pressing it against her cheek,  handed it to the other, who fondled it in a  similar fashion. \"* That must be fun,"  thought Nightley. " Why shouldn\"t I be in  It ? " So he hurried on ahead of the beauti-  ful girls, and, alighting on a convenient door-  step, transformed himself into a most invit-  ing kitten. Now, Nightley Hightime was a  married fairy, and he should not have done,  this. But retribution was close upon him,  for two small boys, who were passing at that  moment, immediately tried to catch him, and</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>failing in that set their dog upon him. As  luck would have it, there was no place to es-  cape, and Nightley, without reflection, sped  nervously up some steps, the dog in hot  pursuit. His brain was even quicker than  his legs, and he made a swift resolve. As  he reached the upper step, he suddenly faced  about and turned himself into a bishop.  The dog fell back, paralyzed with astonish-  ment. The awe-stricken boys stood still for  an instant, then turned and fled. At that  moment the door was jerked open behind  him and a gentleman cried : ** Get away,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>the bishop.</paragraph>

" You have saved my life," said the  bishop, "at least that was your intention,  and I desire to reward you. What is your  dearest wish ? "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>"Yes," said the gentleman, with some  embarrassment; " I have thought I should  like to be a family coachman."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>" That is asking more than you realize,"  replied the bishop. "You are probably  laboring under the common delusion that  a family coachman is mentally inferior to  an Episcopal clergyman."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='107'>The gentleman seemed surprised.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='108'>"A family coachman," continued the  bishop, " must possess, in the first place, at  least as much tact, dignity, and outward  respectability. And, although you may  not be prepared to hear this, it requires</paragraph>

As to your discourses,  there are probably few men in your congre-  gation who would care to exchange a good  pair of horses for all the sermons you are  likely to deliver."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='112'>The gentleman seemed depressed.  Bishop <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bishop;despon;dent;air' adjectives='' verbs='assume;say'>Hightime</entity> also assumed a despon-  dent air, and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='122'>There once lived in the Hub of the  Universe a man who was the proprietor of  a heavy grief, which all came from his only-  son being a crushing disappointment. He  had the most ambitious plans for the future  of this son; but as the boy grew up it be-  came evident that he was not only with-  out an idea of his own, but lacked the  capacity of recognizing one should he meet  it unannounced. He seldom opened his  mouth save for the purposes of nourishment.  As he was rather handsome, however, it  often required time for strangers to discover  what an ass he really was. His father had  tried for many years to be proud of him,  but it was an uphill struggle that wore  heavily on his spirit.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='129'>"Well, such a change of programme  must be disappointing," said the unhappy  father. " I should be upset myself,** and  looking around to make sure that no one  observed his folly, he opened the cage  door. The mouse stepped quickly out  and ran across the floor, but stopped  in the doorway and said with a polite  bow :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>" I thank you, sir, a thousand times.  You have saved my life, and I shall not for-  get it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='131'>That night the unhappy father went to  bed, thinking gloomily, as was his habit,  upon the empty future of his stupid son.  He slept but a short time when he was  awakened by an unusual sound. As he  opened his eyes he discovered two mice  upon the foot-board of his bed, singing in</paragraph>

But marriage  was not for them, as they were both too  poor. No one else in the little village  having been sanctified by wealth they failed  to realize the vulgarity and sinfulness of  poverty. Jonathan, however, knew there  were innumerable dollars in the outside  world and he decided to try and gather a  few. So when he was twenty-one he said  good-by to his family and friends, and there  was a sad parting with the tearful Dorothy.  He tried hard to persuade her that it was  all for the best. " I don\"t believe in waiting  for Fortune to begin the flirtation," hesaid;  " she doesn\"t seem to be headin\" for this vil-  lage, and, if the old girl\"s got anything forme,  I\"ll jest hunt her up and give her a show."</paragraph>

The trusty hornets guided him  to a spot where the soil seemed promising,  and there he planted the only gold piece he  possessed. Within a minute it began to  sprout. He watched it in a fever of anxiety.  Up it grew and soon began to throw out  little white rectangular leaves. These leaves  were covered with cabalistic inscriptions  which enabled the owner to transform them  into gold at his pleasure. Noisy bulls and  bears tried hard to interfere, and more than  once he thought the enterprise was ruined,  but the hornets always diverted them by  skillful applications of their cruel weapons.  Swiftly grew the plant and many were the  leaves. At the proper moment, when they  were fully developed and would lose their  value if left longer on the branches, Jona-  than plucked them all and hastened from  the garden. Some bears came very near  upsetting him, but the faithful hornets again  saved the treasure by their hot attentions.

She had only been engaged three or four  times before meeting the prince, which, con-  sidering her nationality, was rather unusual.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='695'>u"Far away in the State of Maine, there  stands a fine old colonial mansion. It is  out of repair now, but you can see what a  pleasant home it must have been for Hester,  the little girl who formerly dwelt there.  When her parents died, the old house and  all it contained was sold to strangers.  Everything went to pay her father"s debts,  but of all the heirlooms, the one she most  regretted to part with was the full-length  portrait of an ancestor in Continental uni-  form. Hester always regarded the old  General with the deepest affection, and it  seemed to her that he never failed to return  her glances with a jovial smile. His face  was round and rosy, and it was evident from  his mellow eye and cheerful nose that he  and port had been the fastest friends. He  must have been an important personage, if  one could judge by his blue and buflf coat  with gold facings. One hand was on the  hilt of his sword, the other held a folded  paper, and Hester used to wonder what was  written on it. But the rosy General was  sold with everything else. "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='702'>Now a great surprise was in store for  Hester. The day after her arrival she had  occasion to enter the palatial drawing room  of her new home, and there, to her amaze-  ment and joy, she saw the old General on the  wall. She was very happy and at once felt  more at home. But the General seemed  to have changed since last they met. She  noticed that his eyes, instead of meeting hers  with the old-time smile, looked coldly over  her head and with a much less amiable ex-  pression. She soon found, however, that  when they were alone he beamed pleasantly  upon her, but immediately resumed his  haughty and far-away look when any of the  ^ family entered the room. The only reason  she could think of for such conduct was that  he objected to being taken for an ancestor of  the family, although as a family they were  aristocratic enough for any ancestor. They  wallowed in style and were reeking with  fashion. For all that is pompous and hollow</paragraph>

But  all were prosperous and comnie il faut^ and  absolutely correct in manner and deportment  according to the latest information from  abroad. Consequently they were startingly  original and interesting. After dinner the  eldest son followed Hester into the library,  and when he asked her to be his wife she  could not say him nay, for her heart was  already his. As the library was dimly  lighted, they observed the ceremonies that  usually attend occasions of this nature ; after  which he led her into the palatial drawing  room where all the family and guests were  assembled. Then he announced the good  tidings. All eyes were fixed upon them and  it was a very embarrassing moment for  Hester. After her lover had made the</paragraph>

As her appealing eyes sought instinctively  those of her old friend on the wall, she saw  him turn his eyes toward the wealthy parents  and reach forth his hand. To the wonder-  ment of all present he stepped from his  gilded frame upon the sofa beneath him and  then to the floor.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='8'>THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='9'>It is said that in the days of the famed Prince <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='prince;king;magician;enchanter;world;time' adjectives='famed;great;skilful' verbs='be;say;be;live;call;learn'>Arthur</entity>, who was king of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='prince;king;magician;enchanter;world;time' adjectives='famed;great;skilful' verbs='be;say;be;live;call;learn'>Britain</entity>, in the year 516, there lived a great magician, called <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='prince;king;magician;enchanter;world;time' adjectives='famed;great;skilful' verbs='be;say;be;live;call;learn'>Merlin</entity>, the most learned and skilful enchanter in the world at that time.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='10'>This great magician, who could assume any form he pleased, was travelling in the disguise of a poor beggar, and being very much fatigued, he stopped at the cottage of an honest ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some refreshment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='11'>The countryman gave him a hearty welcome, and his wife, who was a very good-hearted, hospital woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl, an some coarse brown bread on a platter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='12'>Merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the kindness of the ploughman and his wife; but he could not help seeing that though everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both be sad and much cast down. He therefore questioned them on the cause of their sadness, and learned they were miserable because they had no children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='13'>u"The poor woman declared, with tears in her eyes, that she should be the happiest creature in the world if she had a son; and although he was no bigger than her husband"s thumb, she would be satisfied."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='14'>u"Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man"s thumb, that he made up his mind to pay a visit to the queen of the fairies, and ask her to grant the poor woman"s wish. The droll fancy of such a little person among the human race pleased the fairy queen too, greatly, and she promised Merlin that the wish should be granted. Accordingly, a short time after, the ploughman"s wife had a son, who, wonderful to relate! was not bigger than his father"s thumb."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='15'>The fairy queen, wishing to see the little fellow thus born into the world, came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in bed admiring him. The queen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='queen;child;name;fairy' adjectives='little;favorite' verbs='kiss;give;send;dress;bid'>Tom Thumb</entity>, sent for some of the fairies, who dressed her little favorite as she bade them.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='26'>u"It is remarkable that Tom never grew any larger than his father"s thumb, which was only of an ordinary size; but as he got older he became very cunning and full of tricks. When he was old enough to play with the boys, and had lost all his own cherry-stones, he used to creep into the bags of his playfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting out unseen, would again join in the game."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='27'>One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherrystones, where he had been pilfering as usual, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see him. "Ah, ha! my little Tommy," said the boy, "so I have caught you stealing my cherrystones at last, and you shall be rewarded for your thievish tricks." On saying this, he drew the string tight around his neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor little Tom\"s legs, thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out in pain, and begged to be let out, promising never to be guilty of such bad practices again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='28'>A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter-pudding, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time;mother;batter-pudding;edge;bowl;foot;head;ear;batter;mother;pudding-bag;pot' adjectives='short;anxious;unseen' verbs='be;make;be;see;be;make;climb;slip;plump;stir;put;boil'>Tom</entity> being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge of the bowl; but unfortunately his foot slipped and he plumped over head and ears into the batter, unseen by his mother, who stirred him into the pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='29'>u"The batter had filled Tom"s mouth, and prevented him from crying; but, on feeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot, that his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, instantly pulling it out of the pot, she threw it to the door. A poor tinker, who was passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his budget, he then walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter, he then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the tinker that he flung down the pudding and ran away. The pudding being broke to pieces by the fall, Tom crept out covered over with the batter, and with difficulty walked home. His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in such a woeful state, put him into a tea-cup, and soon washed off the batter; after which she kissed him, and laid him in bed."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='30'>u"Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom"s mother went to milk her cow in the meadow, and she took him along with her. As the wind was very high, fearing lest he should be blown away, she tied him to a thistle with a piece of fine thread. The cow soon saw the oak-leaf hat, and, liking the look of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one mouthful. While the cow was chewing the thistle <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='cow;thistle;tooth;piece' adjectives='afraid;great;loud' verbs='be;chew;be;threaten;crush;roar'>Tom</entity> was afraid of her great teeth, which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared out as loud as he could:"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='31'>"Mother, mother!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='32'>"Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" said his mother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='33'>"Here, mother," replied he, "in the red cow\"s mouth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='34'>His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised at the odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out. Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt. She then put <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bosom;home' adjectives='' verbs='put;run'>Tom</entity> in her bosom and ran home with him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='35'>u"Tom"s father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with, and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and rolled into the furrow. A raven, which was flying over, picked him up and flew with him to the top of a giant"s castle that was near the seaside, and there left him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='36'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='state;giant;terrace;pill' adjectives='dreadful;old' verbs='be;do;know;do;be;frighten;come;walk;see;take;swallow'>Tom</entity> was in a dreadful state, and did not know what to do; but he was soon more dreadfully frightened; for old <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='state;giant;terrace;pill' adjectives='dreadful;old' verbs='be;do;know;do;be;frighten;come;walk;see;take;swallow'>Grumbo</entity>, the giant, came up to walk on the terrace, and seeing <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='state;giant;terrace;pill' adjectives='dreadful;old' verbs='be;do;know;do;be;frighten;come;walk;see;take;swallow'>Tom</entity>, he took him up and swallowed him like a pill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='37'>The giant had no sooner swallowed Tom than he began to repent what he had done; for Tom began to kick and jump about so much that he felt very uncomfortable, and at last threw him up again into the sea. A large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was soon after caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur. When they opened the fish in order to cook it, every on was astonished at finding such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted to be out again. They carried him to the king, who made <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;dwarf;court;trick;gambol;king;queen;knight;round;table' adjectives='great;favorite' verbs='carry;make;grow;amuse'>Tom</entity> his dwarf, and he soon grew a great favorite at court: for by his tricks and gambols he not only amused the king and queen, but also all the knights of the Round Table.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='38'>u"It is said that when the kind rode out on horseback he often took <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kind;horseback;shower;s;waistcoat;pocket;rain' adjectives='majesty' verbs='be;say;ride;take;come;use;creep;sleep;be'>Tom</entity> along with him, and if a shower came on he used to creep into his majesty"s waistcoat pocket, where he slept till the rain was over."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='39'>King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if they were as small as he was, and whether rich or poor. Tom told the king that his father and mother were as tall as any of the persons about the court, but rather poor. On hearing this the king carried Tom to the treasure, the place where he kept all his money, and told him to take as much money as he could carry home to his parents, which made the poor little fellow caper with joy. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='purse;treasury;silver' adjectives='water-bubble;three-penny-piece' verbs='go;fetch;be;make;return;get;put'>Tom</entity> went immediately to fetch a purse, which was made of a water-bubble, and then returned to the treasury, where he got a silver three-penny-piece to put into it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='40'>u"Our little hero had some trouble in lifting the burden upon his back; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and set forward on his journey. However, without meeting with any accidents, and after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way, in two days and two nights he reached his father"s house in safety."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='41'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='silver-piece;back;death;mother;house' adjectives='huge;tired' verbs='have;travel;be;run;meet;carry'>Tom</entity> had travelled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his back, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet him, and carried him into the house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='42'>u"Tom"s parents were both happy to see him, and the more so as he had brought such an amazing sum of money with him; but the poor little fellow was excessively wearied, having travelled half a mile in forty-eight hours, with a huge silver three-penny-piece on his back. His mother, in order to recover him, placed him in a walnut shell by the fireside, and feasted him for three days on a hazel nut, which made him very sick; for a whole nut used to serve him a month."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='43'>u"<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rain;ground;king;s;court;mother;wind;direction;parasol;paper;puff;air;mouth;king;s;palace' adjectives='wet;little;cambric' verbs='be;have;be;be;travel;be;blow;make;tie;give;carry'>Tom</entity> was soon well again; but as there had been a fall of rain, and the ground was very wet, he could not travel back to King <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rain;ground;king;s;court;mother;wind;direction;parasol;paper;puff;air;mouth;king;s;palace' adjectives='wet;little;cambric' verbs='be;have;be;be;travel;be;blow;make;tie;give;carry'>Arthur</entity>"s court; therefore his mother, one day when the wind was blowing in that direction, made a little parasol of cambric paper, and tying <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rain;ground;king;s;court;mother;wind;direction;parasol;paper;puff;air;mouth;king;s;palace' adjectives='wet;little;cambric' verbs='be;have;be;be;travel;be;blow;make;tie;give;carry'>Tom</entity> to it, she gave him a puff into the air with her mouth, which soon carried him to the king"s palace."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='44'>u"Just at the time when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time;courtyard;cook;king;s;bowl;furmenty;dish;majesty;fellow;middle;furmenty;cook;s' adjectives='great;fond;poor;little;plump;hot' verbs='come;fly;happen;be;pass;be;be;fall;splash;face'>Tom</entity> came flying across the courtyard, the cook happened to be passing with the king"s great bowl of furmenty, which was a dish his majesty was very fond of; but unfortunately the poor little fellow fell plump into the middle of it, and splashed the hot furmenty about the cook"s face."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='45'>The cook, who was an ill-natured fellow, being in a terrible rage at Tom for frightening and scalding him with the furmenty, went straight to the king, and said that Tom had jumped into the royal furmenty, and thrown it down out of mere mischief. The king was so enraged when he heard this, that he ordered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='king;treason;person' adjectives='enraged;high' verbs='be;hear;order;be;seize;try;be;dare;plead;be;condemn;be;behead'>Tom</entity> to be seized and tried for high treason; and there being no person who dared to plead for him, he was condemned to be beheaded immediately.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='46'>On hearing this dreadful sentence pronounced, poor Tom fell a-trembling with fear, but, seeing no means of escape, and observing a miller close to him gaping with his great mouth, as country boobies do at a far, he took a leap, and fairly jumped down his throat. This exploit was done with such activity that not one person present saw it, and even the miller did not know the trick which Tom had played upon him. Now, as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='court;miller;home;mill' adjectives='' verbs='have;disappear;break;go'>Tom</entity> had disappeared, the court broke up, and the miller went home to his mill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='47'>When Tom heard the mill at work he knew he was clear of the court, and therefore he began to tumble and roll about, so that the poor miller could get no rest, thinking he was bewitched; so he sent for a doctor. When the doctor came, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='doctor;doctor;miller;haste;doctor;man' adjectives='much;frightened;other' verbs='come;begin;dance;sing;be;send;learn'>Tom</entity> began to dance and sing; and the doctor, being as much frightened as the miller, sent in haste for five other doctors and twenty learned men.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='48'>When they were debating about this extraordinary case, the miller happened to yawn, when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='case;miller;chance;jump;foot;middle;table' adjectives='extraordinary' verbs='be;debate;happen;yawn;seize;make;alight'>Tom</entity>, seizing the chance, made another jump, and alighted safely upon his feet in the middle of the table.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='49'>The miller, who was very much provoked at being tormented by such a little pygmy creature, fell into a terrible rage, and, laying hold of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='miller;creature;rage;hold;king;majesty;state;affair;custody' adjectives='much;little;pygmy;terrible' verbs='be;provoke;be;torment;fall;lay;run;be;engage;order;be;take;keep;send'>Tom</entity>, ran to the king with him; but his majesty, being engaged with state affairs, ordered him to be taken away and kept in custody till he sent for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='50'>u"The cook was determined that Tom should not slip out of his hands this time, so he put him into a mouse-trap, and left him to peep through the wires. Tom had remained in the trap a whole week, when he was sent for by King Arthur, who pardoned him for throwing down the furmenty, and took him again into favor. On account of his wonderful feats of activity, Tom was knighted by the king, and went under the name of the renowned Sir Thomas Thumb. As <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;clothes;batter-pudding;furmenty;inside;giant;miller;fish;majesty;suit;clothes;knight' adjectives='new' verbs='have;suffer;order;be;mount'>Tom</entity>"s clothes had suffered much in the batter-pudding, the furmenty, and the insides of the giant, miller, and fishes, his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to be mounted as a knight."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='62'>One day, as they were riding by a farmhouse, a large cat, which was lurking about the door, made a spring, and seized both Tom and his mouse. She then ran up a tree with them, and was beginning to devour the mouse; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tree;mouse;sword;cat;noble;hat;bed;ivory;cabinet' adjectives='little' verbs='run;be;begin;devour;draw;attack;let;catch;lay'>Tom</entity> boldly drew his sword, and attacked the cat so fiercely that she let them both fall, when one of the nobles caught him in his hat, and laid him on a bed of down, in a little ivory cabinet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='63'>The queen of fairies came soon after to pay Tom a visit, and carried him back to Fairy-land, where he lived several years. During his residence there, King Arthur, and all the persons who knew Tom, had died; and as he was desirous of being again at court, the fairy queen, after dressing him in a suit of clothes, sent him flying through the air to the palace, in the days of king Thunstone, the successor of Arthur. Every one flocked round to see him, and being carried to the king, he was asked who he was--whence he came--and where he lived? <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='answer'>Tom</entity> answered:</paragraph>

He also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='73'>The queen was so enraged at the honor paid to Sir <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='queen;honor;sir;king;knight' adjectives='enraged;little;saucy' verbs='be;pay;resolve;ruin;tell;have;be'>Thomas</entity> that she resolved to ruin him, and told the king that the little knight had been saucy to her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='74'>The king sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the danger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he lay for a long time, until he was almost starved with hunger; but at last he ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground, near his hiding-place, he approached very cautiously, and getting himself placed astride on it, was immediately carried up into the air. The butterfly flew with him from tree to tree and from field to field, and at last returned to the court, where the king and nobility all strove to catch him; but at last poor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='butterfly;tree;tree;field;field;court;king;nobility;seat;watering-pot' adjectives='last;last;poor' verbs='fly;return;strive;catch;fall;be;drown'>Tom</entity> fell from his seat into a watering-pot, in which he was almost drowned.</paragraph>

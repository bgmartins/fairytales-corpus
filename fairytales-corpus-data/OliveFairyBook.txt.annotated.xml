	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='75'>PREFACE</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>That was the end of the Court and of the Court Fairy Tales, and just when they were demolished, learned men like the Grimms and Sir Walter Scott began to take an interest in the popular tales of peasants and savages all the world over. All the world over the tales were found to be essentially the same things. _Cinderella_ is everywhere; a whole book has been written on _Cinderella_ by Miss Cox, and a very good book it is, but not interesting to children. For them the best of the collections of foreign fairy tales are the German stories by the Grimms, the _Tales from the Norse_, by Sir G. W. Dasent, (which some foolish "grown-ups" denounced as "improper"), and Miss Frere"s Indian stories. There are hundreds of collections of savage and peasant fairy tales, but, though many of these are most interesting, especially Bishop Callaway"s Zulu stories (with the Zulu versions), these do not come in the way of parents and uncles, and therefore do not come in the way of children. It is my wish that children should be allowed to choose their own books. Let their friends give them the money and turn them loose in the book shops! They know their own tastes, and if the children are born bookish, while their dear parents are the reverse, (and this does occur!), then the children make the better choice. They are unaffected in their selections; some want Shakespeares of their own, and some prefer a volume entitled _Buster Brown_. A few--alas, how few!--are fond of poetry; a still smaller number are fond of history. "We know that there are no fairies, but history stories are _true_!" say these little innocents. I am not so sure that there are no fairies, and I am only too well aware that the best "history stories" are not true.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>What children do love is ghost stories. "Tell us a ghost story!" they cry, and I am able to meet the demand, with which I am in sincere sympathy. Only strong control prevents me from telling the last true ghost story which I heard yesterday. It would suit children excellently well. "The Grey Ghost Story Book" would be a favourite. At a very early age I read a number of advertisements of books, and wept because I could not buy dozens of them, and somebody gave me a book on Botany! It looked all right, nicely bound in green cloth, but within it was full of all manner of tediousness.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='356'>Once upon a time there lived, in a small cottage among some hills, a woman with her son, and, to her great grief, the young man, though hardly more than twenty years of age, had not as much hair on his head as a baby. But, old as he looked, the youth was very idle, and whatever trade his mother put him to he refused to work, and in a few days always came home again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='357'>On a fine summer morning he was lying as usual half asleep in the little garden in front of the cottage when the sultan"s daughter came riding by, followed by a number of gaily dressed ladies. The youth lazily raised himself on his elbow to look at her, and that one glance changed his whole nature.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='358'>"I will marry her and nobody else," he thought. And jumping up, he went to find his mother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='359'>"You must go at once to the sultan, and tell him that I want his daughter for my wife," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='360'>"WHAT?" shouted the old woman, shrinking back into a corner, for nothing but sudden madness could explain such an amazing errand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='361'>"Don"t you understand? You must go at once to the sultan and tell him that I want his daughter for my wife," repeated the youth impatiently.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='362'>"But--but, do you know what you are saying?" stammered the mother. "You will learn no trade, and have only the five gold pieces left you by your father, and can you really expect that the sultan would give his daughter to a penniless bald-pate like you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='363'>"That is _my_ affair; do as I bid you." And neither day nor night did her son cease tormenting her, till, in despair, she put on her best clothes, and wrapped her veil about her, and went over the hill to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='clothes;despair;veil;hill;son' adjectives='best' verbs='do;wrap;go;torment;put;cease' valence='5.43785714286' arousal='4.07857142857' dominance='5.33428571429'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='364'>It was the day that the sultan set apart for hearing the complaints and petitions of his people, so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='complaint;set;people;admission;sultan;presence;difficulty;petition' adjectives='' verbs='be;hear;find;gain' valence='5.45071428571' arousal='3.68285714286' dominance='5.57142857143'>the woman</entity> found no difficulty in gaining admission to his presence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>[Illustration: LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>"Do not think me mad, O Excellency," she began, "though I know I must seem like it. But I have a son who, since his eyes have rested on the veiled face of the princess, has not left me in peace day or night till I consented to come to the palace, and to ask your Excellency for your daughter"s hand. It was in vain I answered that my head might pay the forfeit of my boldness, he would listen to nothing. Therefore am I here; do with me even as you will!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='367'>Now the sultan always loved anything out of the common, and this situation was new indeed. So, instead of ordering the trembling creature to be flogged or cast into prison, as some other sovereigns might have done, he merely said: "Bid your son come hither."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='368'>The old woman stared in astonishment at such a reply. But when the sultan repeated his words even more gently than before, and did not look in anywise angered, she took courage, and bowing again she hastened homeward.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='369'>"Well, how have you sped?" asked her son eagerly as she crossed the threshold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='370'>"You are to go up to the palace without delay, and speak to the sultan himself," replied the mother. And when he heard the good news, his face lightened up so wonderfully that his mother thought what a pity it was that he had no hair, as then he would be quite handsome.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='371'>"Ah, the lightning will not fly more swiftly," cried he. And in another instant he was out of her sight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='372'>When the sultan beheld the bald head of his daughter"s wooer, he no longer felt in the mood for joking, and resolved that he must somehow or other shake himself free of such an unwelcome lover. But as he had summoned the young man to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='reason;man' adjectives='young' verbs='say;dismiss;have;summon' valence='5.67' arousal='4.19666666667' dominance='5.69666666667'>the palace</entity>, he could hardly dismiss him without a reason, so he hastily said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='373'>"I hear you wish to marry my daughter? Well and good. But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='world;tree;bird;husband;home' adjectives='' verbs='be;make;bring;have;collect' valence='6.46352941176' arousal='3.89764705882' dominance='5.73764705882'>the man</entity> who is to be her husband must first collect all the birds in the world, and bring them into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='world;tree;bird;husband;home' adjectives='' verbs='be;make;bring;have;collect' valence='6.46352941176' arousal='3.89764705882' dominance='5.73764705882'>the gardens</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='world;tree;bird;husband;home' adjectives='' verbs='be;make;bring;have;collect' valence='6.46352941176' arousal='3.89764705882' dominance='5.73764705882'>the palace</entity>; for hitherto no birds have made their homes in the trees."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='374'>The young man was filled with despair at the sultan"s words. How was he to snare all these birds? and even if he _did_ succeed in catching them it would take years to carry them to the palace! Still, he was too proud to let the sultan think that he had given up <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='whither;struggle;road;sultan' adjectives='proud' verbs='be;notice;lead;give;walk;let;take;have;go;think' valence='5.82684210526' arousal='4.28789473684' dominance='5.46526315789'>the princess</entity> without a struggle, so he took a road that led past <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='whither;struggle;road;sultan' adjectives='proud' verbs='be;notice;lead;give;walk;let;take;have;go;think' valence='5.82684210526' arousal='4.28789473684' dominance='5.46526315789'>the palace</entity> and walked on, not noticing whither he went.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='375'>In this manner a week slipped by, and at length he found himself crossing a desert with great rocks scattered here and there. In the shadow cast by one of these was seated a holy man or dervish, as he was called, who motioned to the youth to sit beside him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='376'>"Something is troubling you, my son," said the holy man; "tell me what it is, as I may be able to help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='377'>"O, my father," answered the youth, "I wish to marry the princess of my country; but the sultan refuses to give her to me unless I can collect all the birds in the world and bring them into his garden. And how can I, or any other man, do that?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='378'>"Do not despair," replied the dervish, "it is not so difficult as it sounds. Two days" journey from here, in the path of the setting sun, there stands a cypress tree, larger than any other cypress that grows upon the earth. Sit down where the shadow is darkest, close to the trunk, and keep very still. By-and-by you will hear a mighty rushing of wings, and all the birds in the world will come and nestle in the branches. Be careful not to make a sound till everything is quiet again, and then say "Madschun!" At that the birds will be forced to remain where they are--not one can move from its perch; and you will be able to place them all over your head and arms and body, and in this way you must carry them to the sultan."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='379'>With a glad heart the young man thanked the dervish, and paid such close heed to his directions that, a few days later, a strange figure covered with soft feathers walked into the presence of the sultan. The princess"s father was filled with surprise, for never had he seen such a sight before. Oh! how lovely were those little bodies, and bright frightened eyes! Soon a gentle stirring was heard, and what a multitude of wings unfolded themselves: blue wings, yellow wings, red wings, green wings. And when the young man whispered "Go," they first flew in circles round the sultan"s head, and then disappeared through the open window, to choose homes in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;sultan;window;home;circle;man' adjectives='open;young' verbs='fly;whisper;s;choose;go;round;disappear' valence='6.00058823529' arousal='4.06529411765' dominance='5.65058823529'>the garden</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>[Illustration: HOW THE BIRDS WERE BROUGHT TO THE SULTAN]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='381'>"I have done your bidding, O Sultan, and now give me the princess," said the youth. And the sultan answered hurriedly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='382'>"Yes! oh, yes! you have pleased me well! Only one thing remains to turn you into a husband that any girl might desire. That head of yours, you know--it is so _very_ bald! Get it covered with nice thick curly hair, and _then_ I will give you my daughter. You are so clever that I am sure this will give you no trouble at all."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='383'>Silently the young man listened to the sultan"s words, and silently he sat in his mother"s kitchen for many days to come, till, one morning, the news reached him that the sultan had betrothed his daughter to the son of the wizir, and that the wedding was to be celebrated without delay in the palace. With that he arose in wrath, and made his way quickly and secretly to a side door, used only by the workmen who kept the building in repair, and, unseen by anyone, he made his way into the mosque, and then entered the palace by a gallery which opened straight into the great hall. Here the bride and bridegroom and two or three friends were assembled, waiting for the appearance of the sultan for the contract to be signed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='384'>"Madschun!" whispered the youth from above. And instantly everyone remained rooted to the ground; and some messengers whom the sultan had sent to see that all was ready shared the same fate.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='385'>At length, angry and impatient, the sultan went down to behold with his own eyes what had happened, but as nobody could give him any explanation, he bade one of his attendants to fetch a magician, who dwelt near one of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='spell;eye;sultan;explanation;nobody;genius;length;gate;attendant;magician' adjectives='impatient;angry;own;evil' verbs='be;give;bid;remove;fetch;cast;have;go;dwell;behold;happen' valence='5.475' arousal='4.06428571429' dominance='5.39464285714'>the city</entity> gates, to remove the spell which had been cast by some evil genius.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>"It is your own fault," said the magician, when he had heard the sultan"s story. "If you had not broken your promise to the young man, your daughter would not have had this ill befall her. Now there is only one remedy, and the bridegroom you have chosen must yield his place to the bald-headed youth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>Sore though he was in his heart, the sultan knew that the magician was wiser than he, and despatched his most trusted servants to seek out the young man without a moment"s delay and bring him to the palace. The youth, who all this time had been hiding behind a pillar, smiled to himself when he heard these words, and, hastening home, he said to his mother: "If messengers from the sultan should come here and ask for me, be sure you answer that it is a long while since I went away, and that you cannot tell where I may be, but that if they will give you money enough for your journey, as you are very poor, you will do your best to find me." Then he hid himself in the loft above, so that he could listen to all that passed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='388'>The next minute someone knocked loudly at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='woman;someone' adjectives='old' verbs='jump;knock;open' valence='5.60428571429' arousal='4.10714285714' dominance='5.34571428571'>the door</entity>, and the old woman jumped up and opened it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='389'>"Is your bald-headed son here?" asked the man outside. "If so, let him come with me, as the sultan wishes to speak with him directly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='390'>"Alas! sir," replied <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;sir;news;veil;corner' adjectives='' verbs='put;reply;reach;have;leave' valence='5.54933333333' arousal='4.02666666667' dominance='5.434'>the woman</entity>, putting a corner of her veil to her eyes, "he left me long since, and since that day no news of him has reached me."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='406'>In a part of Arabia where groves of palms and sweet-scented flowers give the traveller rest after toilsome journeys under burning skies, there reigned a young king whose name was Lino. He had grown up under the wise rule of his father, who had lately died, and though he was only nineteen, he did not believe, like many young men, that he must change all the laws in order to show how clever he was, but was content with the old ones which had made the people happy and the country prosperous. There was only one fault that his subjects had to find with him, and that was that he did not seem in any hurry to be married, in spite of the prayers that they frequently offered him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='407'>The neighbouring kingdom was governed by the Swan fairy, who had an only daughter, the Princess Hermosa, who was as charming in her way as Lino in his. The Swan fairy always had an ambassador at the young king"s court, and on hearing the grumbles of the citizens that Lino showed no signs of taking a wife, the good man resolved that _he_ would try his hand at match-making. "For," he said, "if there is any one living who is worthy of the Princess Hermosa he is to be found here. At any rate, I can but try and bring them together."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='408'>Now, of course, it was not proper to offer the princess in marriage, and the difficulty was to work upon the unconscious king so as to get the proposal to come from _him_. But the ambassador was well used to the ways of courts, and after several conversations on the art of painting, which Lino loved, he led the talk to portraits, and mentioned carelessly that a particularly fine picture had lately been made of his own princess. "Though, as for a likeness," he concluded, "perhaps it is hardly as good as this small miniature, which was painted a year ago."</paragraph>

Riquette, for such was her name, had also fallen in love with a portrait, but it was of King Lino, and she implored her father to give him to her for a husband. Ismenor, who considered that no man lived who was worthy of his treasure, was about to send his chief minister to King Lino on this mission, when the news reached him that the king had already started for the court of the Swan fairy. Riquette was thrown into transports of grief, and implored her father to prevent the marriage, which Ismenor promised to do; and calling for an ugly and humpbacked little dwarf named Rabot, he performed some spells which transported them quickly to a rocky valley through which the king and his escort were bound to pass. When the tramp of horses was heard, the magician took out an enchanted handkerchief, which rendered invisible any one who touched it. Giving one end to Rabot, and holding the other himself, they walked unseen amongst the horsemen, but not a trace of Lino was to be found. And this was natural enough, because the king, tired out with the excitement and fatigue of the last few days, had bidden the heavy coaches, laden with presents for the princess, to go forwards, while he rested under the palms with a few of his friends.

True, the portrait was faithful enough, but how could that fair outside contain so rough and rude a soul? Yet this even she might have forgiven had the king shown any of the signs of love and admiration to which she had been so long accustomed. As for her mother, the poor Swan fairy was so bewildered at the extraordinary manners of her new son-in-law, that she was almost speechless.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='441'>The queen stood where the chamberlain left her, thinking deeply.

No, _this_ was her real son-in-law--the man dressed in dirty clothes, and imprisoned in one of Ismenor"s strongest towers, and kissing the portrait of Hermosa, which had escaped the wizard"s notice, owing to the young king having worn it, for better concealment, tied amongst his hair. Calling hastily to her daughter, she bade her also look, and Hermosa had the pleasure of gazing on Lino, who was behaving exactly as she could have wished. The mirror was still in her hand when the door of the prison opened, and there entered the hideous Riquette, who, from her upraised eyes, seemed to be begging from Lino some favour which he refused to grant.

But the tower was so thoroughly enchanted that the more she tried to reach the ground the tighter something tried to hold her back. At length, by putting forth all the power she possessed, she managed to descend to the foot of the tower, and there, weak and faint as she was with her exertions, she lost no time in working her spells, and found that she could only overcome Ismenor by means of a stone from the ring of Gyges. But how was she to get this ring? for the magic book told her that Ismenor guarded it night and day among his most precious treasures. However, get it she must, and in the meantime the first step was to see the royal prisoner himself. So, drawing out her tablets, she wrote as follows:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='452'>[Illustration: THE SWALLOW BRINGS THE NOTE TO LINO]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='453'>"The bird which brings you this letter is the Swan fairy, mother of Hermosa, who loves you as much as you love her!" And after this assurance, she related the wicked plot of which he had been the victim. Then, quickly changing herself into a swallow, she began to fly round the tower, till she discovered the window of Lino"s prison. It was so high up that bars seemed needless, especially as four soldiers were stationed in the passage outside, therefore the fairy was able to enter, and even to hop on his shoulder, but he was so much occupied with gazing at the princess"s portrait that it was some time before she could attract his attention. At last she gently scratched his cheek with the corner of the note, and he looked round with a start. On perceiving the swallow he knew at once that help had come, and tearing open the letter, he wept with joy on seeing the words it contained, and asked a thousand questions as to Hermosa, which the swallow was unable to answer, though, by repeated nods, she signed to him to read further. "Must I indeed pretend to wish to marry that horrible Riquette?" he cried, when he had finished. "Can I obtain the stone from <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stone' adjectives='' verbs='obtain' valence='5.402' arousal='3.958' dominance='5.932'>the magician</entity>?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='454'>Accordingly the next morning, when Riquette paid him her daily visit, he received her much more graciously than usual. The magician"s daughter could not contain her delight at this change, and in answer to her expressions of joy, Lino told her that he had had a dream by which he had learned the inconstancy of Hermosa; also that a fairy had appeared and informed him that if he wished to break the bonds which bound him to the faithless princess and transfer his affections to the daughter of Ismenor, he must have in his possession for a day and a night a stone from the ring of Gyges, now in the possession of the magician. This news so enchanted Riquette, that she flung her arms round the king"s neck and embraced him tenderly, greatly to his disgust, as he would infinitely have preferred the sticks of the soldiers. However, there was no help for it, and he did his best to seem pleased, till <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='stone;father;help;time' adjectives='precious;pleased;best' verbs='be;do;relieve;obtain;lose;ask;announce;seem' valence='5.92066666667' arousal='3.806' dominance='5.814'>Riquette</entity> relieved him by announcing that she must lose no time in asking her father and obtaining from him the precious stone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='455'>His daughter"s request came as a great surprise to Ismenor, whose suspicions were instantly excited; but, think as he would, he could not see any means by which the king, so closely guarded, might have held communication with the Swan fairy. Still, he would do nothing hastily, and, hiding his dismay, he told Riquette that his only wish was to make her happy, and that as she wished so much for the stone he would fetch it for her. Then he went into the closet where all his spells were worked, and in a short time he discovered that his enemy the Swan fairy was at that moment inside his palace.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='456'>"So that is it!" he said, smiling grimly. "Well, she shall have a stone by all means, but a stone that will turn everyone who touches it into marble." And placing a small ruby in a box, he returned to his daughter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='457'>"Here is the talisman which will gain you the love of King Lino," he said; "but be sure you give him the box unopened, or else the stone will lose all its virtue." With a cry of joy Riquette snatched the box from his hands, and ran off to the prison, followed by her father, who, holding tightly the enchanted handkerchief, was able, unseen, to watch the working of the spell.

And even supposing that King Lino _did_ fly that way, there were thousands of blue parrots in the forest, and how was she to know him, or he her?

Eagerly he read on, seeking for some means of breaking the enchantment, and at last, to his great joy, he discovered the remedy. Then he hurried to his wife, who was lying on some cushions under the tree on which the parrot had perched, and informed her that her favourite was really the king of a great country, and that, if she would whistle for the bird, they would all go together to a certain spot in the Forest of Marvels, "where I will restore him to his own shape. Only you must not be afraid or cry out, whatever I do," added he, "or everything will be spoilt." The wizard"s wife jumped up in an instant, so delighted was she, and began to whistle the song that the parrot loved; but as he did not wish it to be known that he had been listening to the conversation he waited until she had turned her back, when he flew down the tree and alighted on her shoulder.

Changing himself into a bat, the magician flew into the room, and hiding himself in the curtains, he poured all the liquid over Ismenor"s face, so that he died without a groan.

The faithful woman could not sleep for thinking about her charges, and her soul sank when, a few months after the marriage, war broke out with a country across the seas, and the king rode away at the head of his troops. Then there happened what she had so long expected. One night, when, unlike her usual habit, she was sleeping soundly--afterwards she felt sure that a drug had been put into her food--the witch came to the tower. Exactly what she did there no one knew, but, when the sun rose, the beds of Grethari and Geirlaug were empty. At dawn the queen summoned some of her guards, and told them that she had been warned in a dream that some evil fate would befall her through a wild beast, and bade them go out and kill every animal within two miles of the palace. But the only beasts they found were two black foals of wondrous beauty, fitted for the king"s riding; it seemed a pity to kill them, for what harm could two little foals do anyone?

But whatever might be the meaning of it, things would be sure to improve with the king to rule in the palace instead of his wife. Unfortunately, their joy only lasted a short while; for the very first night after the king"s arrival the queen related the evil dream she had dreamt in his absence, and begged him to go out the next morning and kill every living creature he saw within two miles of the city. The king, who always believed everything the queen said, promised to do as she wished. But before he had ridden through the lovely gardens that surrounded the palace, he was attracted by the singing of two little blue birds perched on a scarlet-berried holly, which made him think of everything beautiful that he had ever heard of or imagined.

And on the occasion of a feast their places were always next that of the king, so it was easy for the queen to scatter a slow but fatal poison in their cups without anyone being the wiser. Before dawn the palace was roused by the news that the king was dead, and that the three officers of the guards were dying also. Of course nobody"s cries and laments were as loud as those of the queen. But when once the splendid funeral was over, she gave out that she was going to shut herself up in a distant castle till the year of her mourning was over, and after appointing a regent of the kingdom, she set out attended only by a maid who knew all her secrets. Once she had left the palace she quickly began to work her spells, to discover under what form Geirlaug and Grethari lay hidden.

And so it was. But when, after a mighty struggle, the shark floated dead and harmless on the surface of the water, the whale was so exhausted that she had only strength enough to drag her wounded body into a quiet little bay, and for three days she remained there as still and motionless as if she had been dead herself.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='503'>"_Why_ should I be thirsty?" replied Grethari, staring at her in astonishment. "It will not take me five minutes to reach the castle gate."

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='504'>Grethari had spoken truly when he declared that he could easily get to the castle in five minutes.

For a few more paces he staggered on blindly, when, suddenly, the sound of rushing water smote upon his ears; and in a little wood that bordered the path he beheld a stream falling over a rock. At this sight his promise to Geirlaug was forgotten.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='518'>"Lauphertha," said Geirlaug quickly, for she did not wish anyone to know who she was; and following her new mistress into the house, she begged to be taught her work without delay. And so clever was she, that, by-and-by, it began to be noised abroad that the strange girl who had come to live in the forester"s house had not her equal in the whole kingdom for skill as well as beauty. Thus the years slipped away, during which Geirlaug grew to be a woman. Now and then she caught glimpses of Grethari as he rode out to hunt in the forest, but when she saw him coming she hid herself behind the great trees, for her heart was still sore at his forgetfulness. One day, however, when she was gathering herbs, he came upon her suddenly, before she had time to escape, though as she had stained her face and hands brown, and covered her beautiful hair with a scarlet cap, he did not guess her to be his foster-sister.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='519'>"What is your name, pretty maiden?" asked he.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='526'>So Grethari set out for the stable where the calf stood, and wound the rope about its horns. But when he had made it fast to the wall, he found that a coil of the rope had twisted itself round his wrist, and, pull as he might, he could not get free. All night he wriggled and struggled till he was half dead with fatigue. But when the sun rose the rope suddenly fell away from him, and, very angry with the maiden he dragged himself back to the palace. "She is a witch," he muttered crossly to himself, "and I will have no more to do with her." And he flung himself on his bed and slept all day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='527'>Not long after this adventure the king and queen sent their beloved son on an embassy to a neighbouring country to seek a bride from amongst the seven princesses. The most beautiful of all was, of course, the one chosen, and the young pair took ship without delay for the kingdom of the prince"s parents. The wind was fair and the vessel so swift that, in less time than could have been expected, the harbour nearest the castle was reached. A splendid carriage had been left in readiness close to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='readiness;horse;honour;review;s;son;carriage;part;marriage;close' adjectives='great;splendid' verbs='be;leave;take;have;carry;hold;find' valence='6.00068965517' arousal='3.95862068966' dominance='5.5875862069'>the beach</entity>, but no horses were to be found, for every one had been carried off to take part in a great review which <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='readiness;horse;honour;review;s;son;carriage;part;marriage;close' adjectives='great;splendid' verbs='be;leave;take;have;carry;hold;find' valence='6.00068965517' arousal='3.95862068966' dominance='5.5875862069'>the king</entity> was to hold that day in honour of his son"s marriage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='528'>"I can"t stay here all day," said the princess, crossly, when Grethari told her of the plight they were in. "I am perfectly worn out as it is, and you will have to find something to draw the carriage, if it is only a donkey. If you don"t, I will sail back straight to my father."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='529'>Poor Grethari was much troubled by the words of the princess. Not that he felt so very much in love with her, for during the voyage she had shown him several times how vain and bad tempered she was; but as a prince and a bridegroom, he could not, of course, bear to think that any slight had been put upon her. So he hastily bade his attendants to go in search of some animal, and bring it at once to the place at which they were waiting.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='530'>[Illustration: "WILL YOU LEND ME YOUR OX, FAIR MAIDEN?"]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='531'>During the long pause the princess sat in the beautiful golden coach, her blue velvet mantle powdered with silver bees drawn closely round her, so that not even the tip of her nose could be seen. At length a girl appeared driving a young ox in front of her, followed by one of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='length;s;messenger;ox;front;girl' adjectives='young' verbs='follow;be;appear;talk;drive' valence='5.67933333333' arousal='4.12933333333' dominance='5.382'>the prince</entity>"s messengers, who was talking eagerly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='532'>"Will you lend me your ox, fair maiden?" asked Grethari, jumping up and going to meet them. "You shall fix your own price, and it shall be paid ungrudgingly, for never before was king"s son in such a plight."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='533'>"My price is seats for me and my two friends behind you and your bride at the wedding feast," answered she.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='534'>Six horses would not have drawn the coach at the speed of this one ox. Trees and fields flew by so fast that the bride became quite giddy, and expected, besides, that they would be upset every moment. But, in spite of her fears, nothing happened, and they drew up in safety at the door of the palace, to the great surprise of the king and queen. The marriage preparations were hurried on, and by the end of the week everything was ready. It was, perhaps, fortunate that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time;jewel;period;journey;wedding;round;clothes' adjectives='much;busy;cross;rude;fortunate' verbs='be;forget;pay;heed;have;come' valence='5.78863636364' arousal='3.92818181818' dominance='5.25545454545'>the princess</entity> was too busy with her clothes and her jewels during this period to pay much heed to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='time;jewel;period;journey;wedding;round;clothes' adjectives='much;busy;cross;rude;fortunate' verbs='be;forget;pay;heed;have;come' valence='5.78863636364' arousal='3.92818181818' dominance='5.25545454545'>Grethari</entity>, so that by the time the wedding day came round he had almost forgotten how cross and rude she had been on the journey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='535'>The oldest men and women in the town agreed that nothing so splendid had ever been seen as the bridal procession to the great hall, where the banquet was to be held, before the ceremony was celebrated in the palace. The princess was in high good humour, feeling that all eyes were upon her, and bowed and smiled right and left. Taking the prince"s hand, she sailed proudly down the room, where the guests were already assembled, to her place at the head of the table by the side of the bridegroom. As she did so, three strange ladies in shining dresses of blue, green, and red, glided in and seated themselves on a vacant bench immediately behind the young couple. The red lady was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;wand;forester;hand;s;birch;basket;bark;lady' adjectives='other;closed;red' verbs='be;hold;have;bring' valence='5.76176470588' arousal='4.00176470588' dominance='5.4'>Geirlaug</entity>, who had brought with her the forester"s daughters, and in one hand she held a wand of birch bark, and in the other a closed basket.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='536'>Silently they sat as the feast proceeded; hardly anyone noticed their presence, or, if they did, supposed them to be attendants of their future queen. Suddenly, when the merriment was at its height, Geirlaug opened the basket, and out flew a cock and hen. To the astonishment of everyone, the birds circled about in front of the royal pair, the cock plucking the feathers out of the tail of the hen, who tried in vain to escape from him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='537'>"Will you treat me as badly as Grethari treated Geirlaug?" cried the hen at last. And Grethari heard, and started up wildly.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='538'>"Where is Geirlaug?" he exclaimed, looking round the hall; and his eyes fell upon the strange lady. With a smile she held out a ring which he had given her on her twelfth birthday, when they were still children, without a thought of the future. "You and none other shall be my wife," he said, taking her hand, and leading her into the middle of the company.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='539'>It is not easy to describe the scene that followed. Of course, nobody understood what had occurred, and the king and queen imagined that their son had suddenly gone mad. As for the princess her rage and fury were beyond belief. The guests left the hall as quickly as they could, so that the royal family might arrange their own affairs, and in the end it was settled that half the kingdom must be given to the despised princess, instead of a husband. She sailed back at once to her country, where she was soon betrothed to a young noble, whom, in reality, she liked much better than Grethari.

In the midst, seated on a white horse with black and silver trappings, was a lady whom the duchess at once knew to be her friend the Countess of Blanchelande, a young widow like herself, mother of a little boy two years older than Abeille des Clarides. The duchess hailed her arrival with delight, but her joy was soon turned into weeping when the countess sank down beside her on a pile of cushions, and told the reason of her visit.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='579'>This was too much for Abeille. Bursting into tears, she flung herself on Youri"s neck, and declared that wherever he went she would go too. So, peace having been made between them, they set out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='580'>[Illustration: ABEILLE FINDS HERSELF AMONG THE LITTLE MEN]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='581'>It was a hot day, and the townspeople were indoors waiting till the sun was low in the sky before they set out either to work or play, so the children passed through the streets unperceived, and crossed the river by the bridge into the flowery meadows along the road by which they had ridden with the duchess. By-and-by Abeille began to feel thirsty, but the sun had drunk up all the water, and not a drop was left for her. They walked on a little further, and by good luck found a cherry-tree covered with ripe fruit, and after a rest and a refreshing meal, they were sure that they were strong enough to reach the lake in a few minutes. But soon Abeille began to limp and to say that her foot hurt her, and Youri had to untie the ribbons that fastened her shoe and see what was the matter. A stone had got in, so this was easily set right, and for a while they skipped along the path singing and chattering, till Abeille stopped again. This time her shoe had come off, and turning to pick it up she caught sight of the towers of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='heart;sight;tear;shoe;way;time;tower' adjectives='such;long' verbs='look;burst;turn;sink;have;pick;catch;come' valence='5.62647058824' arousal='3.88823529412' dominance='5.40352941176'>the castle</entity>, looking such a long way off that her heart sank, and she burst into tears.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='582'>"It is getting dark, and the wolves will eat us," sobbed she. But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='arm' adjectives='' verbs='put;comfort;round' valence='5.915' arousal='3.14' dominance='5.98'>Youri</entity> put his arms round her and comforted her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='583'>"Why we are close to the lake now. There is nothing to be afraid of! We shall be home again to supper," cried he. And Abeille dried her eyes, and trotted on beside him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='584'>Yes, the lake was there, blue and silvery with purple and gold irises growing on its banks, and white water-lilies floated on its bosom. Not a trace was there of a man, or of one of the great beasts so much feared by Abeille, but only the marks of tiny forked feet on the sand. The little girl at once pulled off her torn shoes and stockings and let the water flow over her, while Youri looked about for some nuts or strawberries. But none were to be found.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='585'>"I noticed, a little way back, a clump of blackberry bushes," said he. "Wait here for me, and I will go and gather some fruit, and after that we will start home again." And Abeille, leaning her head drowsily against a cushion of soft moss, murmured something in reply, and soon fell asleep. In her dream a crow, bearing the smallest man that ever was seen, appeared hovering for a moment above her, and then vanished. At the same instant <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='strawberry;instant;side;leaf-full' adjectives='large;same' verbs='place;return' valence='5.85571428571' arousal='4.09714285714' dominance='5.69571428571'>Youri</entity> returned and placed by her side a large leaf-full of strawberries.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='586'>"It is a pity to wake her just yet," thought he, and wandered off beyond a clump of silvery willows to a spot from which he could get a view of the whole lake. In the moonlight, the light mist that hung over the surface made it look like fairyland. Then gradually the silver veil seemed to break up, and the shapes of fair women with outstretched hands and long green locks floated towards him. Seized with a sudden fright, the boy turned to fly. But it was too late.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='590'>"No! No! What should such a beautiful princess do in a cage?" cried Dig. And Tad, who was the kindest of them all, proposed to carry her home to her parents. But the other gnomes were too pleased with their new toy to listen to this for a moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='591'>"Look, she is waking," whispered Pau. And as he spoke Abeille slowly opened her eyes. At first she imagined she was still dreaming; but as the little men did not move, it suddenly dawned upon her that they were real, and starting to her feet, she called loudly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='592'>"Youri! Youri! Where are you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='593'>At the sound of her voice the gnomes only pressed more closely round her, and, trembling with fear, she hid her face in her hands. The gnomes were at first much puzzled to know what to do; then Tad, climbing on a branch of the willow tree that hung over her, stooped down, and gently stroked her fingers. The child understood that he meant to be kind, and letting her hands fall, gazed at her captors. After an instant"s pause she said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='594'>"Little men, it is a great pity that you are so ugly. But, all the same, I will love you if you will only give me something to eat, as I am dying of hunger."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='595'>A rustle was heard among the group as she spoke. Some were very angry at being called ugly, and said she deserved no better fate than to be left where she was. Others laughed, and declared that it did not matter what a mere mortal thought about them; while Tad bade Bog, their messenger, fetch her some milk and honey, and the finest white bread that was made in their ovens under the earth. In less time than Abeille would have taken to tie her shoe he was back again, mounted on his crow. And by the time she had eaten the bread and honey and drunk the milk, Abeille was not frightened any more, and felt quite ready to talk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='596'>"Little men," she said, looking up with a smile, "your supper was very good, and I thank you for it. My name is Abeille, and my brother is called Youri.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='597'>"But your feet are so sore that you cannot walk," answered Dig. "And we may not cross the bounds into your country. The best we can do is to make a litter of twigs and cover it with moss, and we will bear you into the mountains, and present you to our king."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='598'>Now, many a little girl would have been terrified at the thought of being carried off alone, she did not know where. But Abeille, when she had recovered from her first fright, was pleased at the notion of her strange adventure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='599'>"How much she would have to tell her mother and Youri on her return. Probably _they_ would never go inside a mountain, if they lived to be a hundred." So she curled herself comfortably on her nest of moss, and waited to see what would happen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='600'>Up, and up, and up they went; and by-and-by Abeille fell asleep again, and did not wake till the sun was shining. Up, and up, and up, for the little men could only walk very slowly, though they could spring over rocks quicker than any mortal. Suddenly the light that streamed through the branches of the litter began to change. It seemed hardly less bright, but it was certainly different; then the litter was put down, and the gnomes crowded round and helped Abeille to step out of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='601'>Before her stood a little man not half her size, but splendidly dressed and full of dignity. On his head was a crown of such huge diamonds that you wondered how his small body could support it. A royal mantle fell from his shoulders, and in his hand he held a lance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='602'>"King Loc," said one of the forest gnomes, "we found this beautiful child asleep by the lake, and have brought her to you. She says that her name is Abeille, and her mother is the Duchess des Clarides."</paragraph>

For King Loc had already thought what a good wife she would make him in a few years" time, and he did not want Youri to come between them. So he was silent, and Abeille, seeing he was not pleased, burst into tears.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='616'>When Abeille grew accustomed to do without her mother and Youri, she made herself happy enough in her new home. Everyone was kind to her, and petted her, and then there were such quantities of new things for her to see. The gnomes were always busy, and knew how to fashion beautiful toys as well or better than the people who lived on the earth; and now and then, wandering with Tad or Dig in the underground passages, Abeille would catch a glimpse of blue sky through a rent in the rocks, and this she loved best of all. In this manner six years passed away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='617'>"His Highness King Loc wishes to see you in his presence chamber," said Tad, one morning, to Abeille, who was singing to herself on a golden lute; and Abeille, wondering why the king had grown so formal all of a sudden, got up obediently. Directly she appeared, King Loc opened a door in the wall which led into his treasure chamber. Abeille had never been there before, and was amazed at the splendid things heaped up before her. Gold, jewels, brocades, carpets, lay round the walls, and she walked about examining one glittering object after another, while King Loc mounted a throne of gold and ivory at one end of the hall, and watched her. "Choose whatever you wish," he said at last. A necklace of most lovely pearls was hanging from the wall, and after hesitating for a moment between that and a circlet of diamonds and sapphires, Abeille stretched up her hand towards it. But before she touched it her eyes lighted on a tiny piece of sky visible through a crack of the rock, and her hand dropped by her side. "Little <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='loc' adjectives='little' verbs='go;say;let' valence='5.98857142857' arousal='4.38428571429' dominance='5.66714285714'>King</entity> Loc, let me go up to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='loc' adjectives='little' verbs='go;say;let' valence='5.98857142857' arousal='4.38428571429' dominance='5.66714285714'>the earth</entity> once again," she said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='618'>Then King Loc made a sign to the treasurer, who opened a coffer full of nothing but precious stones, larger and more dazzling than were worn by any earthly monarch. "Choose what you will, Abeille," whispered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='loc;abeille' adjectives='' verbs='whisper;choose' valence='5.865' arousal='3.7625' dominance='6.1575'>King</entity> Loc.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='619'>But Abeille only shook her head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='620'>"A drop of dew in the garden at Clarides is brighter to me than the best of those diamonds," she answered, "and the bluest of the stones are not as blue as the eyes of Youri." And as she spoke a sharp pain ran through the heart of King Loc. For an instant he said nothing, then he lifted his head and looked at her. "Only those who despise riches should possess them.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='623'>The king sighed.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='625'>After this, in spite of the fact that everyone was just as kind to her as before, Abeille was no longer the merry child who passed all her days playing with the little gnomes. People who dwell under the earth grow up much faster than those who live on its surface, and, at thirteen, the girl was already a woman. Besides, King Loc"s words had set her thinking; she spent many hours by herself, and her face was no longer round and rosy, but thin and pale. It was in vain that the gnomes did their best to entice her into her old games, they had lost their interest, and even her lute lay unnoticed on the ground.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='627'>"Little King Loc," she said, turning her eyes upon him, "let me behold my mother again, or I shall surely die." Her voice shook, and her whole body trembled. Even an enemy might have pitied her; but the king, who loved her, answered nothing. All day long Abeille stayed there, watching the light fade, and the sky grow pale. By-and-by the stars came out, but the girl never moved from her place. Suddenly a hand touched her. She looked round with a start, and there was King Loc, covered from head to foot in a dark mantle, holding another over his arm. "Put on this and follow me," was all he said. But Abeille somehow knew that she was going to see her mother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='628'>On, and on, and on they went, through passages where Abeille had never been before, and at length she was out in the world again. Oh! how beautiful it all was!

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='630'>By this time they had reached the room which Abeille knew so well, and her heart beat violently as the gnome carried her over the threshold. By the light of a lamp hanging over the bed Abeille could see her mother, beautiful still, but with a face that had grown pale and sad.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='743'>"Nonsense!" snapped the queen. "It was a jackal."

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='746'>So the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question to them.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='748'>To this the other agreed; therefore, when the king asked them what animal they had seen, both the guards said it was certainly a tiger, and that the king was right of course, as he always was. The king made no remark, but sent for a palanquin, and ordered the queen to be placed in it, bidding the four bearers of the palanquin to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave her. In spite of her tears, she was forced to obey, and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood. There they set down the palanquin with <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;palanquin' adjectives='' verbs='start;set' valence='6.41' arousal='4.185' dominance='6.03'>the queen</entity> in it, and started home again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='749'>Now the queen thought to herself that the king could not mean to send her away for good, and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back; so she stayed quite still for a long time, listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps, but heard none. After a while she grew nervous, for she was all alone, and put her head out of the palanquin and looked about her. Day was just breaking, and birds and insects were beginning to stir; the leaves rustled in a warm breeze; but, although the queen"s eyes wandered in all directions, there was no sign of any human being. Then her spirit gave way, and she began to cry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='750'>It so happened that close to the spot where the queen"s palanquin had been set down, there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest, where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbours. As it was hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house, but was awakened by the sound of weeping. He jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could, and into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sound;palanquin;place' adjectives='fast' verbs='jump;come;run;find' valence='6.27571428571' arousal='4.22428571429' dominance='5.86857142857'>the forest</entity> towards the place the sound came from, and there he found the palanquin.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='753'>"Oh, you that weep," repeated the farmer, "fear not to speak to me, for you are to me as a daughter. Tell me, who are you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='754'>His voice was so kind that the queen gathered up her courage and spoke. And when she had told her story, the farmer called his wife, who led her to their house, and gave her food to eat, and a bed to lie on. And in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;prince;mother' adjectives='little' verbs='be;name;bear;wish' valence='6.06083333333' arousal='4.125' dominance='5.2725'>the farm</entity>, a few days later, a little prince was born, and by his mother"s wish named <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;prince;mother' adjectives='little' verbs='be;name;bear;wish' valence='6.06083333333' arousal='4.125' dominance='5.2725'>Ameer Ali</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='755'>Years passed without a sign from the king. His wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care, though the queen still lived with the farmer, and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong, handsome, and healthy youth. Out in the forest they seemed far from the world; very few ever came near them, and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his own living. But she and the wise farmer always counselled him to wait, until, at last, when he was eighteen years of age, they had not the heart to forbid him any longer. So he started off one early morning, with a sword by his side, a big brass pot to hold water, a few pieces of silver, and a galail[2] or two-stringed bow in his hand, with which to shoot birds as he travelled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='756'>Many a weary mile he tramped day after day, until, one morning, he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred, and he stepped joyfully into it, like one who goes to meet an old friend. Presently, as he made his way through a thicket, he saw a pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner, so he fired a pellet at it from his galail, but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter. At the same instant he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket, and, on reaching the spot, he found an ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head an earthen vessel with a hole in it from which the water was pouring. When she saw <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='galail;hand' adjectives='' verbs='see;call' valence='5.42' arousal='4.15' dominance='5.1375'>the prince</entity> with his galail in his hand, she called out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='757'>"Oh, wretched one! why must you choose an old woman like me to play your pranks upon? Where am I to get a fresh pitcher instead of this one that you have broken with your foolish tricks? And how am I to go so far for water twice when one journey wearies me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='758'>[Illustration: THE UNLUCKY SHOT]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='759'>"But, mother," replied the prince, "I played no trick upon you! I did but shoot at a pigeon that should have served me for dinner, and as my pellet missed it, it must have broken your pitcher. But, in exchange, you shall have my brass pot, and that will not break easily; and as for getting water, tell me where to find it, and I"ll fetch it while you dry your garments in the sun, and carry it whither you will."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='760'>At this the old woman"s face brightened. She showed him where to seek the water, and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim, she led the way without a word, and he followed. In a short while they came to a hut in the forest, and as they drew near it Ameer Ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on. At the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut, and much as he wished to see her again Ameer Ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back, and so, with a heavy heart, he made his salutation, and bade the old woman farewell. But when he had gone a little way she called after him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='761'>"If ever you are in trouble or danger, come to where you now stand and cry: "Fairy of the Forest! Fairy of the forest, help me now!" And I will listen to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='762'>The prince thanked her and continued his journey, but he thought little of the old woman"s saying, and much of the lovely damsel. Shortly afterwards he arrived at a city; and, as he was now in great straits, having come to the end of his money, he walked straight to the palace of the king and asked for employment. The king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more; but the young man pleaded so hard that at last the rajah was sorry for him, and promised that he should enter his bodyguard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous. This was just what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;wish;agree;want;do' valence='6.31666666667' arousal='3.97333333333' dominance='6.035'>Ameer Ali</entity> wanted, and he agreed to do whatever <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='be;wish;agree;want;do' valence='6.31666666667' arousal='3.97333333333' dominance='6.035'>the king</entity> might wish.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='763'>Soon after this, on a dark and stormy night, when the river roared beneath the palace walls, the sound of a woman weeping and wailing was heard above the storm. The king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter; but the servant, falling on his knees in terror, begged that he might not be sent on such an errand, particularly on a night so wild, when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad. Indeed, so frightened was he, that the king, who was very kind-hearted, bade another to go in his stead, but each one showed the same strange fear. Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='step' valence='5.68' arousal='3.48' dominance='6.0'>Ameer Ali</entity> stepped forward:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='764'>"This is my duty, your majesty," he said, "I will go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='765'>The king nodded, and off he went. The night was as dark as pitch, and the wind blew furiously and drove the rain in sheets into his face; but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water. Inch by inch, and foot by foot he fought his way across, now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy, now narrowly escaping being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream. At length he emerged, panting and dripping wet, on the other side. Close by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='body;evildoer;sound;foot;gallows' adjectives='' verbs='sob;hang;hear;stand;have;come' valence='4.974' arousal='4.176' dominance='5.30666666667'>the bank</entity> stood a gallows, and on the gallows hung the body of some evildoer, whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;evildoer;sound;foot;gallows' adjectives='' verbs='sob;hang;hear;stand;have;come' valence='4.974' arousal='4.176' dominance='5.30666666667'>the king</entity> had heard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='766'>Ameer Ali was so grieved for the one who wept there that he thought nothing of the wildness of the night or of the roaring river. As for ghosts and witches, they had never troubled him, so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ghost;witch;figure;gallows' adjectives='' verbs='trouble;crouch;have;walk' valence='4.79222222222' arousal='4.30888888889' dominance='5.03444444444'>the woman</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='767'>"What ails you?" he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='768'>Now the woman was not really a woman at all, but a horrid kind of witch who really lived in Witchland, and had no business on earth. If ever a man strayed into Witchland the ogresses used to eat him up, and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper, and that is why she had been sobbing and crying in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='769'>So when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='reply;question' valence='6.255' arousal='3.555' dominance='6.335'>Ameer Ali</entity> questioned her, she replied:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='775'>"Very well, we will try." With that he drew his sword, pretending that he needed it to lean upon, and bent so that the old woman could clamber on to his back, which she did very nimbly. Then, suddenly, he felt a noose slipped over his neck, and the old witch sprang from his shoulders on to the gallows, crying:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='784'>Ameer Ali then sat down to collect himself a little, and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had evidently fallen off the old witch"s foot. This he put into his pocket, and as the storm had by this time passed over he made his way back to the palace. When he had finished his story, he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed it to the king, who, like everyone else, was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it. Indeed, Ameer Ali himself was astonished, for he had slipped the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;anklet;beauty;princess' adjectives='proud;delighted' verbs='be;praise;give;have;spoil;reward' valence='6.44' arousal='4.68' dominance='5.66214285714'>The king</entity> was delighted at its beauty, and having praised and rewarded <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;anklet;beauty;princess' adjectives='proud;delighted' verbs='be;praise;give;have;spoil;reward' valence='6.44' arousal='4.68' dominance='5.66214285714'>Ameer Ali</entity>, he gave the anklet to his daughter, a proud and spoiled princess.</paragraph>

As soon as they appeared in the presence-chamber the king received them with open arms, for in his heart he had no doubt that his wife was the peerless beauty destined to unfasten the collar. And, indeed, if paint and hair-dye and magnificent dresses could have ensured her doing so, he would certainly have been right. But, blinded by his love for this wicked woman, he had really no idea that her charms were not her own.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='856'>At the appointed hour the queen entered the throne-room, having by her side the young princess, in the most grievous plight imaginable. Her dress was so contrived as to give the idea that she had a hump; her pink-and-white skin was thickly covered with yellow paint, and her black hair all hidden by a close-fitting brown cloth cap. Murmurs of indignation rose on all sides, and the ambassadors, who had frequently heard the princess compared to the lovely Ferrandina, were dumb with astonishment.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='857'>Mounting the throne, the prince commanded the trial to begin at once, and the collar was handed to the princess"s governess, who, being one of the ugliest women that ever was seen, naturally failed to turn the key. Seizing the chance of his being for a short time in power, the prince resolved to punish her cruelties towards his sister, and especially this last one, to which she had prompted the queen, and ordered her to be taken out and executed, which was done, with great good will, by the attendants. He then further commanded the ladies in waiting to attend his sister to her apartments, and bathe her and dress her in the queen"s most splendid robes, as she had none of her own; and the queen, though gnashing her teeth with anger, for once dared not interfere. More quickly than could have been expected, the princess returned, looking so beautiful that if anyone had doubted before who would be able to unlock the collar they were instantly convinced. The prince glanced at her, but said nothing, and, signing to one of the ambassadors, he ordered him to make trial of the comb. One by one each man present did his best to remove it from its case, and one by one each was forced to own himself beaten.

The rapid motion through the air deprived the princess of her senses, which she nearly lost a second time, from fright, when she was set down alone in the middle of a thick forest. She ran wildly about, calling to her brother to come to her aid; but her cries only attracted the attention of some hungry wolves, who sprung towards her with their jaws gaping and their red tongues hanging out. Falling on her knees, she covered her face with one hand unconsciously grasping the collar with the other, and awaited her doom. Already she could feel their hot breath on her cheek, and crouched lower and lower, when the eyes of the foremost wolf caught sight of the collar. With a howl that echoed through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='howl;companion' adjectives='' verbs='follow;bound;echo' valence='5.47' arousal='4.57428571429' dominance='5.19'>the forest</entity> he bounded away, followed by his companions.</paragraph>

Very gently she drew near, hoping he might follow her into the castle, but he only set off in another direction, and, tired though she was, something forced the girl to follow him. Thankful indeed was she when he turned a corner and sat down before the door of a tiny palace, which was built on the bank of a river. When she came up he took the hem of her dress between his teeth and led her into a room where there was a table covered with milk and fruit. After she had eaten and drunk, she lay down upon a pile of cushions, with the fox at her feet, and fell asleep to dream of her lost brother.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='866'>If the princess was dreaming of her brother, he was no less thinking of her, on the wild sea-shore, whither the whirlwind had cast him.

But though the singer seemed close to him he could see her nowhere, and indeed, no sooner had he reached one spot than the voice sounded in another direction, and he followed it up and down, till he was suddenly stopped by the sight of a large fish"s skin, which lay stretched on the sand between the sea and the rocks. The thing was so ugly, that he stepped aside in disgust, and at that instant something leapt into the sea behind his back. This caused him to look round. The fish"s skin was no longer there, but in a cave in the rock behind it he discovered a bath of ebony lined with gold, which glittered in the sunlight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='869'>Days passed without any adventures, and the prince had almost made up his mind to leave the shore, and to seek his sister inland, when once more he heard the voice that had so charmed him, and beheld the bloody skin lying on the sand, and the bath, now filled with water, in the grotto.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='870'>He had not very long to wait, for with the first rays of the sun there appeared, out to sea, a shining white object which was blown by gentle breezes towards the shore. As it came nearer he beheld a maiden, of dazzling loveliness, seated in a shell where blues and pinks and greens all melted into each other. In her hand she held the rope with which the shell was guided.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='871'>The prince was so bewildered at her beauty that he forgot that he was in hiding, and, rushing out, sank on his knees on the sands, holding out his hands towards this wonderful vision. But as he did so the comb and its case fell out of his pocket, and at the sight the lady uttered a wild shriek, and, steering her shell round, vanished speedily in the direction of the island. Throwing off his clothes, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='paw;joy;sail;fox;snow;sign;way;creature;boat;clothes' adjectives='little;great;same;frantic;small;white' verbs='swim;be;set;look;prepare;make;perceive;put;throw' valence='5.91333333333' arousal='4.18481481481' dominance='5.60703703704'>the prince</entity> was preparing to swim after her, when he perceived beside him a snow white fox, looking the same way, and making frantic signs with his paws, till a small boat put out and set sail towards them, to the great joy of the little creature.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='872'>When the boat drew up to the beach, the fox waved his paw towards the prince"s clothes, which he took to mean that he was to put them on again. This done, they both got in, and had just pushed off, when the prince suddenly recollected that the sight of the comb had frightened away the beautiful lady. In a transport of fury he raised his hand to fling it into the sea, but the fox sprang on him and held on so tightly to his arm that he could not lift it. At that moment a horseman on the shore let fly an arrow at the fox, with so true an aim that the little creature fell heavily into the well of the boat, and closed its eyes, like one who has received his death-blow. The grief of the prince was sore. He instantly leaped to land, but the murderer was already far distant. When the young man turned round again, the boat and the fox were nowhere to be seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='873'>An approaching storm drove him into the grotto, which was lighted up by a multitude of tapers, each one being in the shape of a knife half out of its sheath. Over the bath was a tent-shaped covering of white, embroidered with sheaths, and from beneath it came a voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='874'>"Prince, will you trust me whatever happens, knowing that my heart is yours, and as I feel that yours is mine? But, beware, for if you give the smallest sign of fear, when the tent is opened, you will lose me for ever."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='875'>She did well to warn him; and even then he had much ado to keep the colour in his cheeks and his hand from trembling, for a crocodile"s head with snapping jaws advanced towards him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='876'>"Quick! prince! quick! the time is flying, comb me at once or I shall vanish from your sight." At her words he took out the comb, but found to his surprise that it needed all his strength to draw it from its sheath. And, strange to say, that in proportion as the comb emerged from its sheath the lady"s head was freed from its horrible covering, and her body rose a little more out of the water. When her shoulders and arms were freed, she called to him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='877'>"Enough, so far you have obeyed my orders. Now burn my skin."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='878'>"Ah, that I can _never_ do," cried he; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='do;cry;cut;_' valence='5.21714285714' arousal='4.14285714286' dominance='5.02285714286'>the lady</entity> cut him short.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='879'>"Then we shall both rue it for ever," she said gravely; "for I can only be the wife of him who will burn my skin." And while he still stood hesitating, the curtains of the tent fell back on her, and the tapers fizzled out.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='883'>"Ah, fool that I was! This must be the skin she wished me to burn," said he. And seizing it in both hands he flung it into the fire, where it exploded with a terrific noise. At first he rushed off to some distance, not knowing what might next befall, but after a while found that his steps had led him back to the place of the fire. The skin had gone and left no traces, but among the cinders he beheld something shining, which proved to be the magic collar. Ah! then his sister, for whom he had so greatly longed, must be near at last! And before he could turn his head or pick up the collar, her arms were round his neck, and everything else was forgotten.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='884'>"You shall tell your story first," she said, when at length they could speak.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='885'>"You cannot even guess the care he took of me in the little palace. But though nothing could exceed his kindness, I saw by his eyes that there was something he wanted me to give him, but I could not tell what. Alas! the day came that I learnt it to my cost. I had hidden the collar in a thick bush, lest the fox should catch sight of it and be scared away as the other animals had been. But, one day, when we were in the garden, the sun happened to shine straight on it, and he sprang towards it with every sign of delight. He was about to seize it between his teeth when it closed with a loud noise. The fox fled away with a piercing scream, and though I have sought him far and wide, I have never seen him since. I was here when you flung the skin into the cinders, and no doubt, in my hurry to escape, the collar must have dropped from me.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='886'>So great was her grief that the prince dared not tell her what sad fate had overtaken the poor little animal, and trusted that time might soothe her.

A dozen times he was on the point of turning back, and it was not the terror of the mocking words and scornful laughs that kept him from doing so, but the terror lest he should be forced to take part in their wars.

Directly the loss was discovered, which was not for some hours, the king gave orders that the war drum should be beaten, and the warriors assembled in the great square before the palace, trembling with fury at the insult which had been put upon them. Loud were the cries for instant vengeance, and for Samba, son-in-law of the king, to lead them to battle. But shout as they might, Samba never came.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='979'>And where was he? No further than in a cool, dark cellar of the palace, crouching among huge earthenware pots of grain. With a rush of pain at her heart, there his wife found him, and she tried with all her strength to kindle in him a sense of shame, but in vain. Even the thought of the future danger he might run from the contempt of his subjects was as nothing when compared with the risks of the present.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='980'>"Take off your tunic of mail," said the princess at last; and her voice was so stern and cold that none would have known it. "Give it to me, and hand me besides your helmet, your sword and your spear." And with many fearful glances to right and to left, Samba stripped off the armour inlaid with gold, the property of the king"s son-in-law. Silently his wife took, one by one, the pieces from him, and fastened them on her with firm hands, never even glancing at the tall form of her husband who had slunk back to his corner. When she had fastened the last buckle, and lowered her vizor, she went out, and mounting Samba"s horse, gave the signal to the warriors to follow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='981'>Now, although the princess was much shorter than her husband, she was a tall woman, and the horse which she rode was likewise higher than the rest, so that when the men caught sight of the gold-inlaid suit of chain armour, they did not doubt that Samba was taking his rightful place, and cheered him loudly. The princess bowed in answer to their greeting, but kept her vizor down; and touching her horse with the spur, she galloped at the head of her troops to charge the enemy. The Moors, who had not expected to be so quickly pursued, had scarcely time to form themselves into battle array, and were speedily put to flight.

However, he need not have been afraid of harsh words: she merely unbuttoned her armour as fast as possible, and bade him put it on with all speed.

And Samba only smiled and waved his hand, and said nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='984'>Out of all the mass of people assembled there to do honour to Samba, one alone there was who did not shout and praise with the rest. This was the princess"s youngest brother, whose sharp eyes had noted certain things during the fight which recalled his sister much more than they did her husband.

When she got back with her purchases she set the old man on the bedstead and rubbed his crippled leg with the oil for an hour. Then she sat down to the spinning-wheel and spun and spun all night long whilst the old man slept, until, in the morning, she had spun the finest thread that ever was seen. Next she went to the loom and wove and wove until by the evening she had woven a beautiful silver cloth.</paragraph>

As she had done before so Imani did again day after day. Always she spent a penny upon oil and flax, always she tended the old man"s lame limb, and spun and wove the most beautiful cloths and sold them at high prices. Gradually the city became famous for her beautiful stuffs, the old fakir"s lame leg became straighter and stronger, and the hole under the floor of the hut where they kept their money became fuller and fuller of gold pieces. At last, one day, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='last' verbs='say' valence='6.5' arousal='4.035' dominance='5.9425'>the princess</entity> said:</paragraph>

But she began at once, full of hope, by asking for some apartments all to herself and a pot in which to boil water. As soon as the water was heated she steeped some of her berries in it and gave the mixture to the king"s attendants and told them to wash his body with it. The first washing did so much good that the king slept quietly all the night. Again the second day she did the same, and this time the king declared he was hungry, and called for food. After the third day he was quite well, only very weak from his long illness. On the fourth day he got up and sat upon his throne, and then sent messengers to fetch the physician who had cured him. When Imani appeared everyone marvelled that so young a man should be so clever a doctor; and the king wanted to give him immense presents of money and of all kinds of precious things.

"If I only had a child to speak to, however small, what a comfort it would be!" she said to herself. And the heavier the snow fell the oftener she repeated the words.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1103'>"What a lovely little girl!" twittered the birds in the bushes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1104'>Unluckily, a great cockchafer, who was buzzing over the river, happened to catch sight of her, and caught her up in his claws. The poor butterfly was terribly frightened at the sight of him, and he struggled hard to free himself, so that the sash bow gave way, and he flew off into the sunshine. But Maia wasn"t so fortunate, and though the cockchafer collected honey from the flowers for her dinner, and told her several times how pretty she was, she could not feel at ease with him. The cockchafer noticed this, and summoned his sisters to play with her; but they only stared rudely, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1105'>"Where did you pick up that strange object? She is very ugly to be sure, but one ought to pity her for she has only two legs."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1109'>Here Maia stayed for the whole summer, and really was not at all unhappy. She ventured to walk about by herself, and wove herself a bed of some blades of grass, and placed it under a clover leaf for shelter. The red cups that grew in the moss held as much dew as she wanted, and the cockchafer had taught her how to get honey. But summer does not last for ever, and by-and-by the flowers withered, and instead of dew there was snow and ice. Maia did not know what to do, for her clothes were worn to rags, and though she tried to roll herself up in a dry leaf it broke under her fingers. It soon was plain to her that if she did not get some other shelter she would die of hunger and cold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1110'>So, gathering up all her courage, she left the forest and crossed the road into what had been, in the summer, a beautiful field of waving corn, but was now only a mass of hard stalks.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1111'>"It will be warm, at any rate," thought Maia, "and perhaps the person who lives there will give me something to eat. At any rate, I can"t be worse off than I am now." And she walked boldly down the passage. By-and-by she came to a door which stood ajar, and, peeping in, discovered a whole room full of corn.

She needed no second bidding, but ate more than she had ever done in her life, though it was not a breakfast for a humming-bird! When she had quite finished she put out her hand and smiled, and the old mouse said to her:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1114'>"Can you tell stories? If so you may stay with me till the sun gets hot again, and you shall help me with my house. But it is dull here in the winter unless you have somebody clever enough to amuse you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1115'>Yes, Maia had learned a great many stories from her foster-mother, and, besides, there were all her own adventures, and her escapes from death.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1173'>In a village in Hindustan there once lived a merchant who, although he rose early, worked hard, and rested late, remained very poor; and ill-luck so dogged him that he determined at last to go to some distant country and there to try his fortune. Twelve years passed by; his luck had turned, and now he had gathered great wealth, so that having plenty to keep him in comfort for the rest of his days, he thought once more of his native village, where he desired to spend the remainder of his life among his own people. In order to carry his riches with him in safety over the many weary miles that lay between him and his home, he bought some magnificent jewels, which he locked up in a little box and wore concealed upon his person; and, so as not to draw the attention of the thieves who infested the highways and made their living by robbing travellers, he started off in the poor clothes of a man who has nothing to lose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1174'>Thus prepared, he travelled quickly, and within a few days" journey from his own village came to a city where he determined to buy better garments and--now that he was no longer afraid of thieves--to look more like the rich man he had become. In his new raiment he approached the city, and near the great gate he found a bazaar where, amongst many shops filled with costly silks, and carpets, and goods of all countries, was one finer than all the rest. There, amidst his goods, spread out to the best advantage, sat the owner smoking a long silver pipe, and thither the merchant bent his steps, and saluting the owner politely, sat down also and began to make some purchases. Now, the proprietor of the shop, Beeka Mull by name, was a very shrewd man, and as he and the merchant conversed, he soon felt sure that his customer was richer than he seemed, and was trying to conceal the fact. Certain purchases having been made, he invited the new-comer to refresh himself and in a short time they were chatting pleasantly together. In the course of the conversation Beeka <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;name;conversation;beeka;whither;course' adjectives='' verbs='ask;be;travel;observe;hear' valence='5.988' arousal='3.622' dominance='5.855'>Mull</entity> asked the merchant whither he was travelling, and hearing the name of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;name;conversation;beeka;whither;course' adjectives='' verbs='ask;be;travel;observe;hear' valence='5.988' arousal='3.622' dominance='5.855'>the village</entity>, he observed:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1175'>"Ah, you had better be careful on that road--it"s a very bad place for thieves."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1176'>The merchant turned pale at these words.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1177'>"Lala-ji,[3] could you oblige me by locking up for me a small box for a short while? When once I get to my village I could bring back half-a-dozen sturdy men of my own kinsfolk and claim it again."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1179'>"But," pleaded the merchant, "I know no one in this city, and you must surely have some place where you keep your own precious things. Do this, I pray you, as a great favour."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1180'>Still Beeka Mull politely but firmly refused; but the merchant, feeling that he had now betrayed the fact that he was richer than he seemed, and being loth to make more people aware of it by inquiring elsewhere, continued to press him, until at last he consented.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1181'>In a place like an Eastern bazaar, where the shops lie with wide open fronts, and with their goods displayed not only within but without on terraces and verandahs raised a few feet above the public roadway, such a long talk as that between Beeka Mull and the merchant could not but attract some attention from the other shop-keepers in the narrow street. If the merchant had but known it, nearly every shop-owner in that district was a thief, and the cleverest and biggest of all was Beeka Mull. But he did not know it, only he could not help feeling a little uneasy at having thus parted with all his wealth to a stranger.

With that he began to push the merchant out of the shop; and, when the poor man resisted, two of the bystanders came to Beeka Mull"s help, and flung the merchant out into the road, like a bale of goods dropped from a camel.

"You are wrong," returned the other, "thieves don"t sit in full view of people like that, even at night." And so the two passed on, and thought no more of him. About five o"clock next morning Kooshy Ram was returning home again, when, to his astonishment, he saw the miserable merchant still sitting as he had seen him sit hours before. Surely something must be the matter with a man who sat all night in the open street, and Kooshy Ram resolved to see what it was; so he went up and shook the merchant gently by the shoulder. "Who are you?" asked he--"and what are you doing here--are you ill?"</paragraph>

He was high-spirited, kind-hearted, and shrewd into the bargain; but he threw away his money like water, and generally upon the nearest thing or person in his way, and that, alas! most often was himself!

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1209'>So, that afternoon, the merchant at a certain time went and stood by the wall as he was told. He noticed that Beeka Mull saw him, but neither took any heed of the other. Presently up the bazaar came a gorgeous palanquin like those in which ladies of rank are carried about. It was borne by four bearers well dressed in rich liveries, and its curtains and trappings were truly magnificent. In attendance was a grave-looking personage whom the merchant recognized as one of the friends who visited <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='merchant;box;head;attendance;servant;personage;cloth;friend' adjectives='grave-looking' verbs='come;be;visit;cover;recognize' valence='5.55055555556' arousal='3.98388888889' dominance='5.42444444444'>Kooshy Ram</entity>; and behind him came a servant with a box covered with a cloth upon his head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1210'>The palanquin was borne along at a smart pace and was set down at Beeka Mull"s shop. The fat shop-keeper was on his feet at once, and bowed deeply as the gentleman in attendance advanced.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1212'>The gentleman, after whispering at the curtain of the palanquin, explained that this was a relative of his who was travelling, but as her husband could go no further with her, she desired to leave with Beeka Mull a box of jewels for safe custody. Lala bowed again to the ground. "It was not," he said, "quite in his way of business; but of course, if he could please the lady, he would be most happy, and would guard the box with his life." Then <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='box;mouth;mass;gem;jewellery' adjectives='open;rich;enraptured' verbs='be;water;turn;unlock;gaze;call;lay;carry' valence='5.84777777778' arousal='3.85277777778' dominance='5.69777777778'>the servant</entity> carrying the box was called up; the box was unlocked, and a mass of jewellery laid open to the gaze of the enraptured <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='box;mouth;mass;gem;jewellery' adjectives='open;rich;enraptured' verbs='be;water;turn;unlock;gaze;call;lay;carry' valence='5.84777777778' arousal='3.85277777778' dominance='5.69777777778'>Lala</entity>, whose mouth watered as he turned over the rich gems.</paragraph>

Quickly the latter pulled out the key, which hung by a string round his neck, and opened the box; and when he saw that his treasures were all there he rushed into the road, and, with the box under his arm, began dancing like a madman, with great shouts and screams of laughter. Just then a messenger came running up and, saluting the gentleman attending the palanquin, he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1217'>"The lady"s husband has returned, and is prepared to travel with her, so that there is no necessity to deposit the jewels." Whereat the gentleman quickly closed and relocked the box, and handed it back to the waiting servant.

No sooner had he decided to leave his home than he made his plans, and the very next morning he started off with a few clothes in a wallet, and a little money in his pocket.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1357'>But there was one person in the village to whom he wished to say good-bye, and that was a wise old guru, or teacher, who had taught him much. So he turned his face first of all towards his master"s hut, and before the sun was well up was knocking at his door. The old man received his pupil affectionately; but he was wise in reading faces, and saw at once that the youth was in trouble.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1358'>"My son," said he, "what is the matter?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1364'>After some days he came to a great city. He had spent all the money which he had at starting, and therefore resolved to look for work however humble it might be. Catching sight of a prosperous-looking merchant standing in front of a shop full of grain of all kinds, Ram Singh went up to him and asked whether he could give him anything to do. The merchant gazed at him so long that the young man began to lose heart, but at length he answered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1365'>"Yes, of course; there is a place waiting for you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1366'>"What do you mean?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.16' arousal='3.99' dominance='5.78'>Ram Singh</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1367'>"Why," replied the other, "yesterday our rajah"s chief wazir dismissed his body servant and is wanting another. Now you are just the sort of person that he needs, for you are young and tall, and handsome; I advise you to apply there."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1368'>Thanking the merchant for this advice, the young man set out at once for the wazir"s house, and soon managed, thanks to his good looks and appearance, to be engaged as the great man"s servant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1369'>One day, soon after this, the rajah of the place started on a journey and the chief wazir accompanied him. With them was an army of servants and attendants, soldiers, muleteers, camel-drivers, merchants with grain and stores for man and beast, singers to make entertainment by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='donkey;pony;camel;horse;army;elephant;goat;store;merchant;description;musician;kind;cart;mule;beast;attendant;man;town;wagon;singer;anything;servant;entertainment;camel-driver;soldier;grain;muleteer' adjectives='large' verbs='be;make;accompany;seem' valence='5.73939393939' arousal='3.97454545455' dominance='5.35424242424'>the way</entity> and musicians to accompany them, besides elephants, camels, horses, mules, ponies, donkeys, goats, and carts and wagons of every kind and description, so that it seemed more like a large town on the march than anything else.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1370'>Thus they travelled for several days, till they entered a country that was like a sea of sand, where the swirling dust floated in clouds, and men and beasts were half choked by it. Towards the close of that day they came to a village, and when the headmen hurried out to salute the rajah and to pay him their respects, they began, with very long and serious faces, to explain that, whilst they and all that they had were of course at the disposal of the rajah, the coming of so large a company had nevertheless put them into a dreadful difficulty because they had never a well nor spring of water in their country; and they had no water to give drink to such an army of men and beasts!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1371'>Great fear fell upon the host at the words of the headmen, but the rajah merely told the wazir that he must get water somehow, and that settled the matter so far as _he_ was concerned. The wazir sent off in haste for all the oldest men in the place, and began to question them as to whether there were no wells near by.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1372'>They all looked helplessly at each other, and said nothing; but at length one old grey-beard replied:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1373'>"Truly, Sir Wazir, there is, within a mile or two of this village, a well which some former king made hundreds of years ago.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1374'>The wazir stroked his beard and considered a moment. Then he turned to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chair' adjectives='' verbs='turn;stand' valence='5.245' arousal='3.485' dominance='5.58'>Ram Singh</entity> who stood behind his chair.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1375'>"There is a proverb," said he, "that no man can be trusted until he has been tried. Go you and get the rajah and his people water from this well."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1376'>Then there flashed into Ram Singh"s mind the first counsel of the old guru--"_Always obey without question the orders of him whose service you enter._" So he replied at once that he was ready, and left to prepare for his adventure. Two great brazen vessels he fastened to a mule, two lesser ones he bound upon his shoulders, and thus provided he set out, with the old villager for his guide. In a short time they came to a spot where some big trees towered above the barren country, whilst under their shadow lay the dome of an ancient building. This the guide pointed out as the well, but excused himself from going further as he was an old man and tired, and it was already nearly sunset, so that he must be returning home. So <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='farewell;mule' adjectives='' verbs='go;bid' valence='4.565' arousal='4.05666666667' dominance='4.99'>Ram Singh</entity> bade him farewell, and went on alone with the mule.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1379'>Arrived at the trees, Ram Singh tied up his beast, lifted the vessels from his shoulder, and having found the opening of the well, descended by a flight of steps which led down into the darkness. The steps were broad white slabs of alabaster which gleamed in the shadows as he went lower and lower. All was very silent. Even the sound of his bare feet upon the pavements seemed to wake an echo in that lonely place, and when one of the vessels which he carried slipped and fell upon the steps it clanged so loudly that he jumped at the noise. Still he went on, until at last he reached a wide pool of sweet water, and there he washed his jars with care before he filled them, and began to remount the steps with the lighter vessels, as the big ones were so heavy he could only take up one at a time. Suddenly, something moved above him, and looking up he saw a great giant standing on the stairway! In one hand he held clasped to his heart a dreadful looking mass of bones, in the other was a lamp which cast long shadows about the walls, and made him seem even more terrible than he really was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1380'>"What think you, O mortal," said the giant, "of my fair and lovely wife?" And he held the light towards the bones in his arms and looked lovingly at them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1381'>Now I must tell you that this poor giant had had a very beautiful wife, whom he had loved dearly; but, when she died, her husband refused to believe in her death, and always carried her about long after she had become nothing but bones. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;guru;mind;other;saying' adjectives='wise' verbs='do;forbid;know;reply;come;speak' valence='5.63666666667' arousal='3.97416666667' dominance='5.935'>Ram Singh</entity> of course did not know of this, but there came to his mind the second wise saying of the guru, which forbade him to speak harshly or inconsiderately to others; so he replied:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1383'>"Ah, what eyes you have!" cried the delighted giant, "you at least can see! I do not know how often I have slain those who insulted her by saying she was but dried bones! You are a fine young man, and I will help you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1384'>So saying, he laid down the bones with great tenderness, and snatching up the huge brass vessels, carried them up again, and replaced them with such ease that it was all done by the time that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ease;air;tenderness;time;vessel;brass;one;bone' adjectives='huge;great;smaller;open;such' verbs='be;do;reach;replace;say;lay;have;carry;snatch' valence='5.80238095238' arousal='3.72904761905' dominance='5.64571428571'>Ram Singh</entity> had reached the open air with the smaller ones.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1390'>The rajah was so pleased with the bearing of Ram Singh that he ordered the wazir to give the young man to him in exchange for one of his own servants. So Ram Singh became the rajah"s attendant; and as the days went by the king became more and more delighted with the youth because, mindful of the old guru"s third counsel, he was always honest and spoke the truth. He grew in favour rapidly, until at last the rajah made him his treasurer, and thus he reached a high place in the court and had wealth and power in his hands. Unluckily the rajah had a brother who was a very bad man; and this brother thought that if he could win the young treasurer over to himself he might by this means manage to steal little by little any of the king"s treasure which he needed. Then, with plenty of money, he could bribe the soldiers and some of the rajah"s counsellors, head a rebellion, dethrone and kill his brother, and reign himself instead. He was too wary, of course, to tell Ram Singh of all these wicked plans; but he began by flattering him whenever he saw him, and at last offered him his daughter in marriage. But Ram Singh remembered the fourth counsel of the old guru--never to try to appear the equal of those above him in station--therefore he respectfully declined the great honour of marrying a princess. Of course the prince, baffled at the very beginning of his enterprise, was furious, and determined to work Ram Singh"s ruin, and entering the rajah"s presence he told him a story about Ram Singh having spoken insulting words of his sovereign and of his daughter. What it was all about nobody knew, and, as it was not true, the wicked prince did not know either; but the rajah grew very angry and red in the face as he listened, and declared that until the treasurer"s head was cut off neither he nor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='head;rajah;nobody;brother;face;treasurer;prince' adjectives='angry;true;red;wicked' verbs='be;cut;eat;do;drink;grow;s;know;declare;listen' valence='5.87625' arousal='4.37791666667' dominance='5.57291666667'>the princess</entity> nor his brother would eat or drink.</paragraph>

And with this <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='content' adjectives='' verbs='be;force' valence='5.734' arousal='4.106' dominance='5.106'>the prince</entity> was forced to be content.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1392'>Then the rajah sent for an officer of his guard, and told him to take some soldiers and ride at once to a tower which was situated just outside the town, and if anyone should come to inquire when the building was going to be finished, or should ask any other questions about it, the officer must chop his head off, and bring it to him. As for the body, that could be buried on the spot. The old officer thought these instructions rather odd, but it was no business of his, so he saluted, and went off to do his master"s bidding.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1393'>Early in the morning the rajah, who had not slept all night, sent for Ram Singh, and bade him go to the new hunting-tower, and ask the people there how it was getting on and when it was going to be finished, and to hurry back with the answer! Away went Ram Singh upon his errand, but, on the road, as he was passing a little temple on the outskirts of the city, he heard someone inside reading aloud; and, remembering the guru"s fifth counsel, he just stepped inside and sat down to listen for a minute. He did not mean to stay longer, but became so deeply interested in the wisdom of the teacher, that he sat, and sat, and sat, while the sun rose higher and higher.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1394'>In the meantime, the wicked prince, who dared not disobey the rajah"s command, was feeling very hungry; and as for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='death;rajah;meantime;s;command;news;corner;breakfast;prince' adjectives='hungry;wicked' verbs='be;feel;disobey;cry;eat;dare;wait' valence='4.905' arousal='4.71454545455' dominance='5.08227272727'>the princess</entity>, she was quietly crying in a corner waiting for the news of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='death;rajah;meantime;s;command;news;corner;breakfast;prince' adjectives='hungry;wicked' verbs='be;feel;disobey;cry;eat;dare;wait' valence='4.905' arousal='4.71454545455' dominance='5.08227272727'>Ram Singh</entity>"s death, so that she might eat her breakfast.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1396'>At last the prince could bear it no longer, and hastily disguising himself so that no one should recognise him, he jumped on a horse and galloped out to the hunting-tower, where the rajah had told him that the execution was to take place. But, when he got there, there was no execution going on. There were only some men engaged in building, and a number of soldiers idly watching them. He forgot that he had disguised himself and that no one would know him, so, riding up, he cried out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1397'>"Now then, you men, why are you idling about here instead of finishing what you came to do? When is it to be done?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1398'>At his words the soldiers looked at the commanding officer, who was standing a little apart from the rest.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1399'>As part of the prince"s disguise had been a thick beard, the men did not recognise the dead man as the rajah"s brother; but they wrapped the head in a cloth, and buried the body as their commander bade them.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1400'>Meanwhile the rajah came home from his council, and to his great surprise found neither head nor brother awaiting him; as time passed on, he became uneasy, and thought that he had better go himself and see what the matter was. So ordering his horse he rode off alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1401'>It happened that, just as the rajah came near to the temple where Ram Singh still sat, the young treasurer, hearing the sound of a horse"s hoofs, looked over his shoulder and saw that the rider was the rajah himself! Feeling much ashamed of himself for having forgotten his errand, he jumped up and hurried out to meet his master, who reined up his horse, and seemed very surprised (as indeed he was) to see _him_. At that moment there arrived the officer of the guard carrying his parcel. He saluted the rajah gravely, and, dismounting, laid the bundle in the road and began to undo the wrappings, whilst the rajah watched him with wonder and interest. When the last string was undone, and the head of his brother was displayed to his view, the rajah sprang from his horse and caught the soldier by the arm. As soon as he could speak he questioned the man as to what had occurred, and little by little a dark suspicion darted through him. Then, briefly telling the soldier that he had done well, the rajah drew <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='briefly;guru;rajah;counsel;soldier;s;message;side' adjectives='' verbs='do;draw;attend;delay;have;learn;tell' valence='5.44952380952' arousal='4.0019047619' dominance='5.61904761905'>Ram Singh</entity> to one side, and in a few minutes learned from him how, in attending to the guru"s counsel, he had delayed to do <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='briefly;guru;rajah;counsel;soldier;s;message;side' adjectives='' verbs='do;draw;attend;delay;have;learn;tell' valence='5.44952380952' arousal='4.0019047619' dominance='5.61904761905'>the king</entity>"s message.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1402'>In the end the rajah found from some papers the proofs of his dead brother"s treachery; and Ram Singh established his innocence and integrity.

He was at once admitted into the royal presence, and after a few minutes of careful study announced that the case, though very serious, was not quite hopeless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1409'>"Somewhere in the Great Sea," he said, "there exists a Golden-headed Fish. If you can manage to catch this creature, bring it to me, and I will prepare an ointment from its blood which will restore your sight.

Quite a little fleet of boats was awaiting them and in these they sailed to the middle of the Great Sea.

"Even if we find it this evening, the hundred days will be over in an hour, and long before we could reach the Egyptian capital the doctor will be on his way home.

And so he did, and at the very moment that the hundred days were up, he drew in the net with the Golden-headed Fish entangled in its meshes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1413'>"Success has come, but, as happens often, it is too late," murmured the young man, who had studied in the schools of philosophy; "but, all the same, put the fish in that vessel full of water, and we will take it back to show my father that we have done what we could." But when he drew near the fish it looked up at him with such piteous eyes that he could not make up his mind to condemn it to death. For he knew well that, though the doctors of his own country were ignorant of the secret of the ointment, they would do all in their power to extract something from the fish"s blood.

Dorani had the most lovely hair in the world, for it was like spun gold, and the smell of it was like the smell of fresh roses. But her locks were so long and thick that the weight of it was often unbearable, and one day she cut off a shining tress, and wrapping it in a large leaf, threw it in the river which ran just below her window.

A servant brought her a bowl of curds, which she ate hastily, and then arrayed herself in a robe of silver, and wound about her strings of pearls, while a wreath of roses crowned her hair. When fully dressed, she seated herself upon a four-legged stool over which was a canopy with silken curtains, these she drew around her, and then called out:</paragraph>

Luckily he preferred peace to war, and occupied his time with trying to rule his own kingdom well and wisely. His people were very anxious that he should marry, and as the two princesses were the only ladies to be heard of of suitable age and rank, the emperor sent envoys to their father"s court to ask for the hand of one of them in marriage. But, as he was resolved only to marry a woman whom he could love and be happy with, he determined to see the lady himself before making up his mind. For this purpose he set out in disguise not long after the departure of his ambassadors, and arrived at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ambassador;departure;secret;plan;proposal;princess;purpose' adjectives='elder' verbs='do;set;make;reach;keep;disguise;have;arrive;find' valence='5.7365' arousal='3.975' dominance='5.767'>the palace</entity> very soon after they did; but as he had foolishly kept his plan secret, he found, when he reached <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ambassador;departure;secret;plan;proposal;princess;purpose' adjectives='elder' verbs='do;set;make;reach;keep;disguise;have;arrive;find' valence='5.7365' arousal='3.975' dominance='5.767'>the court</entity>, that they had already made proposals for the elder princess.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1527'>He found it very difficult to conceal his thoughts and to pay the elder princess the amount of attention due to her, though he did his best to be polite; while all he saw or heard during the next few days only increased his love for her younger sister, and at last he confessed that his dearest wish was to make her his wife, if she and her father would grant his desire.</paragraph>

The princess was even more furious than her father, and after consulting together they decided to send the younger daughter to some distant place out of reach of the young emperor; but _where_ this should be they did not quite know.

They had a long and delightful conversation, and parted in the fond hope that their meeting had not been observed. But in this they were sadly mistaken.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1542'>All this time the princess was feeling very anxious. She had been whiling away the hours before this meeting by playing with a little pet monkey, which had been making such funny faces that, in spite of her troubles, she had burst into the hearty laugh overheard by the emperor. But by-and-by she grew restless, waiting for the signal which never came, and, had she dared, would certainly have rebelled when her gaoler, whom she believed to be fast asleep, ordered her to go to bed at once.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1543'>A fortnight passed, which was spent in great anxiety by the poor girl, who grew thin and weak with the uncertainty.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1544'>Finding herself free, the princess flew to the window, and to her horror saw the arrows lying about amongst the bloodstained brambles. Distracted with terror she slipped down the stairs and out of the tower, and ran for some time along a path, when with great good luck she met the husband of her own nurse, who had only just learned of her imprisonment, and was on his way to try and find out whether he could serve her. The princess begged him to get her some men"s clothes while she awaited him in a little wood close by. The good man was overjoyed to be of use, and started at once for the nearest town, where he soon discovered a shop where the court lackeys were accustomed to sell their masters" cast-off clothes. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shoulder;stone;servant;garment;material;bag;journey' adjectives='precious;own;rich' verbs='be;set;bring;hang;cover;disguise;have;put;dress' valence='5.558' arousal='4.116' dominance='5.7145'>The princess</entity> dressed herself at once in the disguise he had brought, which was of rich material and covered with precious stones; and, putting her own garments into a bag, which her servant hung over his shoulders, they both set out on their journey.</paragraph>

One evening they camped in a lovely valley watered by a rippling stream, and towards morning the princess was awakened by a charming voice singing one of the songs of her own childhood. Anxious to find out where the sound came from, she walked to a thicket of myrtles, where she saw a little boy with a quiver at his back and an ivory bow in his hand, singing softly to himself as he smoothed the feathers of his shafts.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1556'>"Here comes the Satin Surgeon! Look at the Satin Surgeon! Long live the Satin Surgeon!" And, on arriving, he was announced by this name, and at once taken to the sick room of the dying man.</paragraph>

The Satin Surgeon listened with sympathy, and tried to persuade the emperor that possibly the princess was not so much to blame as might appear; but, eager though the sick man was to believe this, it took a long while to persuade him of it. At length a day came when the emperor was nearly well, and for the last time the doctor dressed the wounds with the precious salve.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1609'>In the midst of a sandy desert, somewhere in Asia, the eyes of travellers are refreshed by the sight of a high mountain covered with beautiful trees, among which the glitter of foaming waterfalls may be seen in the sunlight. In that clear, still air it is even possible to hear the song of the birds, and smell of the flowers; but though the mountain is plainly inhabited--for here and there a white tent is visible--none of the kings or princes who pass it on the road to Babylon or Baalbec ever plunge into its forests--or, if they do, they never come back. Indeed, so great is the terror caused by the evil reputation of the mountain that fathers, on their death-beds, pray their sons never to try to fathom its mysteries. But in spite of its ill-fame, a certain number of young men every year announce their intention of visiting it and, as we have said, are never seen again.</paragraph>

In vain the old men shook their heads and tried to persuade him to give up his mad scheme.

At length there came a morning when the ducks looked at each other uneasily, and before nightfall they had whispered that if at the end of two days rain had not come, they must fly away and seek a new home, for if they stayed in their old one, which they loved so much, they would certainly die of thirst.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1792'>Earnestly they watched the sky for many hours before they tucked their heads under their wings and fell asleep from sheer weariness, but not the tiniest cloud was to be seen covering the stars that shone so big and brilliant, and hung so low in the heavens that you felt as if you could touch them. So, when the morning broke, they made up their minds that they must go and tell the turtle of their plans, and bid him farewell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1793'>They found him comfortably curled up on a pile of dead rushes, more than half asleep, for he was old, and could not venture out in the heat as he once used.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1794'>"Ah! here you are," he cried; "I began to wonder if I was ever going to see you again, for, somehow, though <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='spending;oneself' adjectives='lonely;smaller;weaker' verbs='be;begin;cry;see;have;go;seem;grow;wonder' valence='5.752' arousal='3.8205' dominance='5.201'>the lake</entity> has grown smaller, I seem to have grown weaker, and it is lonely spending all day and night by oneself!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1795'>"Oh! my friend," answered the elder of the two ducks, "if you have suffered we have suffered also. Besides, I have something to tell you, that I fear will cause you greater pain still. If we do not wish to die of thirst we must leave this place at once, and seek another where the sun"s rays do not come. My heart bleeds to say this, for there is nothing--nothing else in the world--which would have induced us to separate from you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1796'>The turtle was so astonished as well as so distressed at the duck"s speech that for a moment he could find no words to reply. But when he had forced back his tears, he said in a shaky voice:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1797'>"How can you think that I am able to live without you, when for so long you have been my only friends? If you leave me, death will speedily put an end to my grief."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1798'>"_Our_ sorrow is as great as yours," answered the other duck, "but what can we do? And remember that if we are not here to drink the water, there will be the more for you! If it had not been for this terrible misfortune, be sure that nothing would have parted us from one whom we love so dearly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1799'>"My friends," replied the turtle, "water is as necessary to me as to you, and if death stares in your faces, it stares in mine also. But in the name of all the years we have passed together, do not, I beseech you, leave me to perish here alone! Wherever you may go take me with you!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1800'>There was a pause. The ducks felt wretched at the thought of abandoning their old comrade, yet, at the same time, how could they grant his prayer? It seemed quite impossible, and at length one of them spoke:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1801'>"Oh, how can I find words to refuse?" cried he, "yet how can we do what you ask? Consider that, like yours, our bodies are heavy and our feet small. Therefore, how could we walk with you over mountains and deserts, till we reached a land where the sun"s rays no longer burn? Why, before the day was out we should all three be dead of fatigue and hunger! No, our only hope lies in our wings--and, alas! you cannot fly!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1802'>"No, I cannot fly, of course," answered the turtle, with a sigh. "But you are so clever, and have seen so much of the world--surely you can think of some plan?" And he fixed his eyes eagerly on them. Now, when the ducks saw how ardently the turtle wished to accompany them their hearts were touched, and making a sign to their friend that they wished to be alone they swam out into the lake to consult together. Though he could not hear what they said, the turtle could watch, and the half-hour that their talk lasted felt to him like a hundred years. At length he beheld them returning side by side, and so great was his anxiety to know his fate he almost died from excitement before they reached him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1803'>"We hope we have found a plan that may do for you," said the big duck gravely, "but we must warn you that it is not without great danger, especially if you are not careful to follow our directions."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1804'>"How is it possible that I should not follow your directions when my life and happiness are at stake?" asked the turtle joyfully. "Tell me what they are, and I will promise to obey them gratefully."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1805'>"Well, then," answered the duck, "whilst we are carrying you through the air, in the manner that we have fixed upon, you must remain as quiet as if you were dead. However high above the earth you may find yourself, you must not feel afraid, nor move your feet nor open your mouth. No matter what you see or hear, it is absolutely needful for you to be perfectly still, or I cannot answer for the consequences."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1806'>"I will be absolutely obedient," answered the turtle, "not only on this occasion but during all my life; and once more I promise faithfully not to move head or foot, to fear nothing, and never to speak a word during the whole journey."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1807'>This being settled, the ducks swam about till they found, floating in the lake, a good stout stick. This they tied to their necks with some of the tough water-lily roots, and returned as quickly as they could to the turtle.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1808'>"Now," said the elder duck, pushing the stick gently towards his friend, "take this stick firmly in your mouth, and do not let it go till we have set you down on earth again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1809'>The turtle did as he was told, and the ducks in their turn seized the stick by the two ends, spread their wings and mounted swiftly into the air, the turtle hanging between them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1810'>For a while all went well. They swept across valleys, over great mountains, above ruined cities, but no lake was to be seen anywhere. Still, the turtle had faith in his friends, and bravely hung on to the stick.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1811'>At length they saw in the distance a small village, and very soon they were passing over the roofs of the houses. The people were so astonished at the strange sight, that they all--men, women and children--ran out to see it, and cried to each other:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1812'>"Look! look! behold a miracle! Two ducks supporting a turtle! Was ever such a thing known before!" Indeed, so great was the surprise that men left their ploughing and women their weaving in order to add their voices to their friends".</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1813'>The ducks flew steadily on, heeding nothing of the commotion below; but not so the turtle. At first he kept silence, as he had been bidden to do, but at length the clamour below proved too much for him, and he began to think that everyone was envying him the power of travelling through the air. In an evil moment he forgot the promises he had made so solemnly, and opened his mouth to reply, but, before he could utter a word, he was rushing so swiftly through the air that he quickly became unconscious, and in this state was dashed to pieces against the side of a house. Then the ducks let fall after him the stick that had held up their friend, and which was of no further use. Sadly they looked at each other and shook their heads.</paragraph>

Foremost among them was a huge, repulsive scaly creature that led the dreadful procession. The guards were so terrified that they all ran away; but the princess stood in the doorway, as white as death, and with her hands clasped tight together for fear she should scream or faint, and fail to do her part. As they came closer and saw her in the way, all the snakes raised their horrid heads and swayed them to and fro, and looked at her with wicked beady eyes, while their breath seemed to poison the very air. Still the princess stood firm, and, when the leading snake was within a few feet of her, she cried: "Oh, Queen of Snakes, Queen of Snakes, give me back my husband!" Then all the rustling, writhing crowd of snakes seemed to whisper to one another "Her husband? her husband?" But the queen of snakes moved on until her head was almost in the princess"s face, and her little eyes seemed to flash fire. And still the princess stood in the doorway and never moved, but cried again: "Oh, Queen of Snakes, Queen of Snakes, give me back my husband!" Then the queen of snakes replied: "To-morrow you shall have him--to-morrow!" When she heard these words and knew that she had conquered, the princess staggered from the door, and sank upon her bed and fainted. As in a dream, she saw that her room was full of snakes, all jostling and squabbling over the bowls of milk until it was finished. And then they went away.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2070'>Once upon a time the king of a far country was sitting on his throne, listening to the complaints of his people, and judging between them. That morning there had been fewer cases than usual to deal with, and the king was about to rise and go into his gardens, when a sudden stir was heard outside, and the lord high chamberlain entered, and inquired if his majesty would be graciously pleased to receive the ambassador of a powerful emperor who lived in the east, and was greatly feared by the neighbouring sovereigns. The king, who stood as much in dread of him as the rest, gave orders that the envoy should be admitted at once, and that a banquet should be prepared in his honour. Then he settled himself again on his throne, wondering what the envoy had to say.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2071'>The envoy said nothing. He advanced to the throne where the king was awaiting him, and stooping down, traced on the floor with a rod which he held in his hand a black circle all round it. Then he sat down on a seat that was near, and took no further notice of anyone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2072'>The king and his courtiers were equally mystified and enraged at this strange behaviour, but the envoy sat as calm and still as an image, and it soon became plain that they would get no explanation from _him_. The ministers were hastily summoned to a council, but not one of them could throw any light upon the subject. This made <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mystery;someone;sunset' adjectives='angry;capable' verbs='hang;make;solve;tell;find' valence='5.58636363636' arousal='4.40363636364' dominance='5.54363636364'>the king</entity> more angry than ever, and he told them that unless before sunset they could find someone capable of solving the mystery he would hang them all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2073'>The king was, as the ministers knew, a man of his word; and they quickly mapped out the city into districts, so that they might visit house by house, and question the occupants as to whether they could fathom the action of the ambassador. Most of them received no reply except a puzzled stare; but, luckily, one of them was more observant than the rest, and on entering an empty cottage where a swing was swinging of itself, he began to think it might be worth while for him to see the owner. Opening a door leading into another room, he found a second swing, swinging gently like the first, and from the window he beheld a patch of corn, and a willow which moved perpetually without any wind, in order to frighten away the sparrows. Feeling more and more curious, he descended the stairs and found himself in a large light workshop in which was seated a weaver at his loom. But all the weaver did was to guide his threads, for the machine that he had invented to set in motion the swings and the willow pole made the loom work.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2074'>When he saw the great wheel standing in the corner, and had guessed the use of it, the merchant heaved a sigh of relief. At any rate, if the weaver could not guess the riddle, he at least might put the minister on the right track. So without more ado he told the story of the circle, and ended by declaring that the person who could explain its meaning should be handsomely rewarded.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2076'>The weaver stood thinking for a moment and then walked across to a window, outside of which was a hen-coop with two knuckle-bones lying beside it. These he picked up, and taking the hen from the coop, he tucked it under his arm.</paragraph>

Signing to the minister to remain where he was, the weaver advanced to the envoy, and placed the knuckle-bones on the floor beside him. For answer, the envoy took a handful of millet seed out of his pocket and scattered it round; upon which the weaver set down the hen, who ate it up in a moment. At that the envoy rose without a word, and took his departure.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2207'>At these words the king"s face fell. Having once seen the ruby he could not bear to part with it, yet all the money in his treasury would not be enough to buy it. So for a little while he remained silent, wondering what offer he could make the old woman, and at last he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2208'>"If I cannot give you its worth in money, is there anything you will take in exchange?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2209'>"A paper signed by your hand, and sealed with your seal, proclaiming that I may do what I will, without let or hindrance," answered she promptly. And the king, delighted to have obtained what he coveted at so small a cost, gave her the paper without delay. Then the old woman took her leave and returned home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2210'>The fame of this wonderful ruby soon spread far and wide, and envoys arrived at the little house to know if there were more stones to sell. Each king was so anxious to gain possession of the treasure that he bade his messenger outbid all the rest, and so the princess sold the two remaining stones for a sum of money so large that if the gold pieces had been spread out they would have reached from here to the moon. The first thing she did was to build a palace by the side of the cottage, and it was raised on pillars of gold, in which were set great diamonds, which blazed night and day. Of course the news of this palace was the first thing that reached the king her father, on his return from the wars, and he hurried to see it. In the doorway stood a young man of twenty, who was his grandson, though neither of them knew it, and so pleased was <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grandson;palace;army;appearance;commander;youth;doorway;man' adjectives='own;whole;young;pleased' verbs='carry;be;make;stand;know' valence='5.88952380952' arousal='3.89095238095' dominance='5.59238095238'>the king</entity> with the appearance of the youth, that he carried him back to his own palace, and made him commander of the whole army.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2211'>Not long after this, the widow"s son returned to his native land. There, sure enough, was the tiny cottage where he had lived with his mother, but the gorgeous building beside it was quite new to him.

These were the first thoughts that flashed through his mind; but not wishing to betray himself by asking questions of passing strangers, he climbed up into a tree that stood opposite <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thought;question;mind;tree;stranger' adjectives='' verbs='be;wish;flash;watch;betray;pass;ask;climb;stand' valence='5.78277777778' arousal='4.175' dominance='5.56833333333'>the palace</entity> and watched.</paragraph>

The twenty years that had passed since he had last beheld her vanished in an instant, and he knew her to be his own wife, looking almost as young and beautiful as on the day of their parting. He was about to jump down from the tree and hasten to her side, when she was joined by a young man who placed his arm affectionately round her neck. At this sight the angry husband drew his bow, but before he could let fly the arrow, the counsel of the wise man came back to him: "Patience is the first step on the road to happiness." And he laid it down again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2214'>At this moment the princess turned, and drawing her companion"s head down to hers, kissed him on each cheek.

The king was overjoyed to think that his daughter, whom he had long since forgiven and sorely missed, was living at his gates, and was, besides, the mother of the youth who was so dear to him.

At length one was found, good and industrious, as well as pretty; and as the young man raised no objections the wedding took place at once, and the bride and bridegroom went to live in the cottage with the old woman. But no change was to be seen in the husband"s conduct. All day long he was out amusing himself in the company of his former friends, and if his wife dared to say anything to him on his return home he beat her with his stick. And next year, when a baby was born to them, he beat it also.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2256'>Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who ruled over a country so small that you could easily walk round it in one day. They were both very good, simple people; not very wise, perhaps, but anxious to be kind to everybody; and this was often a mistake, for the king allowed all his subjects to talk at once, and offer advice upon the government of the kingdom as well as upon private matters. And the end of it all was, that it was very difficult to get any laws made, and, still more, to get anyone to obey them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2257'>Now, no traveller ever passed through the kingdom without inquiring how it came to be so small. And this was the reason. As soon as Petaldo (for that was the king"s name) had been born, his father and mother betrothed him to the niece of their friend the fairy Gangana--if she should ever have one. But as the years passed on, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;bride;niece;farmer;love;prince' adjectives='beautiful;young;rich' verbs='be;forget;marry;fall;have;pass;destine' valence='6.04157894737' arousal='4.55368421053' dominance='5.35894736842'>Gangana</entity> was still without a niece, the young prince forgot all about his destined bride, and when he was twenty-five he secretly married the beautiful daughter of a rich farmer, with whom he had fallen violently in love.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2258'>When the fairy heard the news she fell into a violent rage, and hurried off to tell the king. The old man thought in his heart that his son had waited quite long enough; but he did not dare to say so, lest some dreadful spell might be thrown over them all, and they should be changed into birds or snakes, or, worst of all, into stones. So, much against his will, he was obliged to disinherit the young man, and to forbid him to come to court. Indeed, he would have been a beggar had it not been for the property his wife had had given her by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;beggar;permission;wife;youth;property' adjectives='' verbs='be;erect;obtain;have;give' valence='5.81631578947' arousal='4.08842105263' dominance='5.68263157895'>the farmer</entity>, which the youth obtained permission to erect into a kingdom.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2259'>Most princes would have been very angry at this treatment, especially as the old king soon died, and the queen was delighted to reign in his place. But Petaldo was a contented young man, and was quite satisfied with arranging his tiny court on the model of his father"s, and having a lord chamberlain, and a high steward and several gentlemen in attendance; while the young queen appointed her own ladies-in-waiting and maids of honour. He likewise set up a mint to coin money, and chose a seneschal as head of the five policemen who kept order in the capital and punished the boys who were caught in the act of throwing stones at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='boy;head;policeman;money;capital;stone;act;window;seneschal;coin;mint;order' adjectives='' verbs='be;set;punish;keep;choose;catch;throw' valence='5.61' arousal='4.12272727273' dominance='5.79409090909'>the palace</entity> windows.</paragraph>

This conduct so struck his king that very soon he never did anything without consulting him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2261'>Each morning Caboche and his son-in-law had breakfast together, and when they had finished, the king took out of his iron chest great bundles of state papers, which he desired to talk over with his seneschal.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2265'>"Well, perhaps you are right," the king replied; secretly glad to be rid of the cares of government. But though Caboche did all the work, Petaldo never failed to appear on grand occasions, in his royal mantle of red linen, holding a sceptre of gilded wood. Meanwhile he passed his mornings in studying books, from which he learned the proper seasons to plant his fruit trees, and when they should be pruned; and his afternoons in his garden, where he put his knowledge into practice.

Instead of chasing it away, as most women would have done, the queen pretended not to notice what the mouse was doing, and was much surprised to see the little creature pick up the cake and carry it off to the chimney. She sprang forwards to stop it, when, suddenly, both the mouse and cake vanished, and in their place stood an old woman only a foot high, whose clothes hung in rags about her. Taking up a sharp pointed iron stick, she drew on the earthen floor some strange signs, uttering seven cries as she did so, and murmuring something in a low voice, among which the queen was sure she caught the words, "faith," "wisdom," "happiness." Then, seizing the kitchen broom, she whirled it three times round her head, and vanished.

Of course, the fairy Gangana could have wrought the change with one wave of her wand; but unluckily the two were no longer friends, because the fairy had tried hard to persuade the queen to declare her niece heiress to the crown, which the queen refused to do. Naturally, therefore, it was no use asking the help of Gangana to enable the queen to take a second husband, who would be certain to succeed her; and messengers were sent all over the neighbouring kingdoms, seeking to find a witch or a fairy who would work the wished-for miracle.

It came at last, and the fairy stood before her in a long robe of pink and silver, held up by a tiny brown dwarf, who carried a small box under his arm. The queen received her with all the marks of respect that she could think of, and at the request of Gangana, ordered the doors and windows of the great hall to be closed, and her attendants to retire, so that she and her guest might be quite alone. Then, opening the box, which was presented to her on one knee by the dwarf, the fairy took from it a small vellum book with silver clasps, a wand that lengthened out as you touched it, and a crystal bottle filled with very clear green water. She next bade the queen sit on a seat in the middle of the room, and the dwarf to stand opposite her, after which she stooped down and drew three circles round them with a golden rod, touched each of them thrice with her wand, and sprinkled the liquid over both.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2286'>At first she felt vaguely puzzled, not remembering clearly what had happened; then it all came back to her, and jumping up she ran to the nearest mirror. Oh! how happy she was! Her long nose and her projecting teeth had become things of beauty, her hair was thick and curly, and bright gold. The fairy had indeed fulfilled her promise! But, in her hurry and pleasure, the queen never noticed that she had not been changed into a beautiful young lady, but into a very tall little girl of eight or nine years old! Instead of her magnificent velvet dress, edged with fur and embroidered in gold, she wore a straight muslin frock, with a little lace apron, while her hair, which was always combed and twisted and fastened with diamond pins, hung in curls down her back. But if she had only known, something besides this had befallen her, for except as regards her love for the king of the Green Isles, her mind as well as her face had become that of a child, and this her courtiers were aware of, if she was not. Of course they could not imagine what had occurred, and did not know how to behave themselves, till the chief minister set them the example by ordering his wife and daughters to copy the queen"s clothes and way of speaking. Then, in a short time, the whole court, including the men, talked and dressed like children, and played with dolls, or little tin soldiers, while at the state dinners nothing was seen but iced fruits, or sweet cakes made in the shape of birds and horses. But whatever she might be doing, the queen hardly ceased talking about the king of the Green Isles, whom she always spoke of as "my little husband," and as weeks passed on, and he did not come, she began to get very cross and impatient, so that her courtiers kept away from her as much as they could. By this time, too, they were growing tired of pretending to be children, and whispered their intention of leaving the palace and taking service under a neighbouring sovereign, when, one day, a loud blast of trumpets announced the arrival of the long-expected guest. In an instant all was smiles again, and in spite of the strictest rules of court etiquette, the queen insisted on receiving the young king at the bottom of the stairs. Unfortunately, in her haste, she fell over her dress, and rolled down several steps, screaming like a child, from fright. She was not really much hurt, though she had scratched her nose and bruised her forehead, but she was obliged to be carried to her room and have her face bathed in cold water. Still, in spite of this, she gave strict orders that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='moment;order;spite;presence' adjectives='strict' verbs='be;enter;bring;give' valence='5.91' arousal='4.105' dominance='5.808'>the king</entity> should be brought to her presence the moment he entered <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='moment;order;spite;presence' adjectives='strict' verbs='be;enter;bring;give' valence='5.91' arousal='4.105' dominance='5.808'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2307'>Now the boy"s favourite toy was a golden ball, and with this he would play from morning till night, without troubling anybody. One day, as he was sitting in the summer-house in the garden, making his ball run all along the walls and catching it again, he noticed an old woman with an earthen pitcher coming to draw water from a well which stood in a corner of the garden. In a moment he had caught his ball and flung it straight at the pitcher, which fell to the ground in a thousand pieces. The old woman started with surprise, but said nothing; only turned round to fetch another pitcher, and as soon as she had disappeared, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='woman;pitcher;ball;nothing;surprise;round' adjectives='old' verbs='turn;start;say;have;pick;hurry;fetch;disappear' valence='5.638' arousal='4.194' dominance='5.51'>the boy</entity> hurried out to pick up his ball.</paragraph>

However, that did not prevent him from putting the question again and again, till at length he grew so weak and ill that he could eat nothing, and in the end was forced to lie in bed altogether.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2316'>Their preparations were soon made, and early one morning the two set out. But neither old man nor young had the slightest idea where they were going, or what they were undertaking.

They had forgotten all about the princess, and their only wish was to find themselves back in the palace again, when, one day, they discovered that they were standing on the shoulder of a mountain. The stones beneath them shone as brightly as diamonds, and both their hearts beat with joy at beholding a tiny old man approaching them. The sight awoke all manner of recollections; the numb feeling that had taken possession of them fell away as if by magic, and it was with glad voices that they greeted the new-comer.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2332'>"There it is, at last," cried the prince; and fresh blood seemed to spring in his veins. But as he and his companion began to climb towards the top they paused in horror, for the ground was white with dead men"s skulls.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2336'>So they went on again, past skulls and dead men"s bones in all degrees of whiteness. And by-and-by they reached another village, where they determined to rest for a little while, so that their wits might be fresh and bright for the task that lay before them. But this time, though the people were kind and friendly, their faces were gloomy, and every now and then woeful cries would rend the air.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2337'>"Oh! my brother, have I lost you?" "Oh! my son, shall I see you no more?"

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2338'>"Ah, you also have come hither to die! This town belongs to the father of the princess, and when any rash man seeks to move the princess to speech he must first obtain leave of the sultan.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2339'>The young man bowed his head in token of thanks, and stood thoughtful for a short time.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2341'>For two or three days they wandered about the bazaars, keeping their eyes and ears open, when, one morning, they met a man carrying a nightingale in a cage.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2342'>"Oh, why cumber yourself with such a useless thing," cried the Lala in disgust; "have you not enough to occupy your hands and mind, without taking an extra burden?" But the prince, who liked having his own way, paid no heed to him, and paying the high price asked by the man, he carried the bird back to the inn, and hung him up in his chamber. That evening, as he was sitting alone, trying to think of something that would make <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shoulder;door;something;nightingale;ear;cage;talk;stick' adjectives='open' verbs='be;perch;sit;make;try;murmur;fail;fasten;peck;think' valence='5.52318181818' arousal='3.87409090909' dominance='5.60363636364'>the princess</entity> talk, and failing altogether, the nightingale pecked open her cage door, which was lightly fastened by a stick, and, perching on his shoulder, murmured softly in his ear:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2343'>"What makes you so sad, my prince?" The young man started. In his native country birds did not talk, and, like many people, he was always rather afraid of what he did not understand. But in a moment he felt ashamed of his folly, and explained that he had travelled for more than a year, and over thousands of miles, to win the hand of the sultan"s daughter. And now that he had reached his goal he could think of no plan to force her to speak.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2344'>"Oh! do not trouble your head about that," replied the bird, "it is quite easy! Go this evening to the women"s apartments, and take me with you, and when you enter the princess"s private chamber hide me under the pedestal which supports the great golden candlestick. The princess herself will be wrapped so thickly in her seven veils that she can see nothing, neither can her face be seen by anyone. Then inquire after her health, but she will remain quite silent; and next say that you are sorry to have disturbed her, and that you will have a little talk with the pedestal of the candlestick. When you speak I will answer."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2345'>The prince threw his mantle over the bird, and started for the palace, where he begged an audience of the sultan.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2346'>"What is your request?" asked the sultan, looking closely at the young man, who was tall and handsome; but when he heard the tale he shook his head pityingly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2347'>"If you can make her speak she shall be your wife," answered he; "but if not--did you mark the skulls that strewed <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='side;skull;wife' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;make;mark;answer;strew;speak' valence='5.84181818182' arousal='3.82454545455' dominance='5.81181818182'>the mountain</entity> side?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2348'>"Some day a man is bound to break the spell, O sultan," replied the youth boldly; "and why should not I be he as well as another? At any rate, my word is pledged, and I cannot draw back now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='2349'>"Well, go if you must," said the sultan.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2350'>Catching up, unseen, his mantle and the cage as they passed into the dark corridor--for by this time night was coming on--the youth found himself standing in a room bare except for a pile of silken cushions, and one tall golden candlestick. His heart beat high as he looked at the cushions, and knew that, shrouded within the shining veils that covered them, lay the much longed-for princess. Then, fearful that after all other eyes might be watching him, he hastily placed the nightingale under the open pedestal on which the candlestick was resting, and turning again he steadied his voice, and besought <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;candlestick;well-being;nightingale;pedestal;voice' adjectives='fearful;besought;other;open' verbs='be;watch;steady;rest;turn;place;tell' valence='5.975' arousal='3.645' dominance='5.683125'>the princess</entity> to tell him of her well-being.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2381'>At the first sound of the princess"s voice, a slave, who was standing at the door, ran at full speed to tell the sultan of the miracle which had taken place, and the delighted father hastened to the spot. But by this time the princess perceived that she had fallen into a trap which had been cunningly laid for her, and would not utter another word. All she could be prevailed on to do was to make signs to her father that the man who wished to be her husband must induce her to speak three times. And she smiled to herself beneath her seven veils as she thought of the impossibility of _that_.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2382'>When the sultan told the prince that though he had succeeded once, he would have twice to pass through the same test, the young man"s face clouded over.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2383'>"Why are you so gloomy?" asked the nightingale, as soon as they were safely outside. "Everything has gone exactly right! Of course the princess was very angry with herself for having spoken. And did you see that, at her first words, the veils that covered her began to rend? Take me back to-morrow evening, and place me on the pillar by the lattice. Fear nothing, you have only to trust to me!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2384'>The next evening, towards sunset, the prince left the cage behind him, and with the bird in the folds of his garment slipped into the palace and made his way straight to the princess"s apartments. He was at once admitted by the slaves who guarded the door, and took care to pass near the window so that the nightingale hopped unseen to the top of a pillar. Then he turned and bowed low to the princess, and asked her several questions; but, as before, she answered nothing, and, indeed, gave no sign that she heard. After a few minutes the young man bowed again, and crossing over to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='man' adjectives='young' verbs='say;cross;bow' valence='5.7175' arousal='3.97625' dominance='5.30375'>the window</entity>, he said:</paragraph>

But she was very hard to please, and refused to wed any of them, though she managed to keep friends with all. Years passed away in this manner, almost without her noticing them, and one by one the young men grew tired of waiting, and sought wives who may have been less handsome, but were also less proud, and at length only three of her former wooers remained--Baldschi, Jagdschi, and Firedschi. Still she held herself apart, thought herself better and lovelier than other women, when, on a certain evening, her eyes were opened at last to the truth. She was sitting before her mirror, combing her curls, when amongst her raven locks she found a long white hair!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2389'>"At this dreadful sight her heart gave a jump, and then stood still.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2391'>"So instead of going to sleep, she thought all night long of different plans, and in the morning she arose and dressed herself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2392'>""That will have to do," she muttered as she pulled out the white hair which had cost her so much trouble. "It is not very good, but I can think of nothing better; and--well, they are none of them clever, and I dare say they will easily fall into the trap." Then she called her slave and bade her let Jagdschi know that she would be ready to receive him in an hour"s time.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2394'>""What is the matter, O Fair One?" he asked, bowing low before her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2395'>""A terrible thing has happened," said she, her voice choked with sobs. "My father died two nights ago, and I buried him in my garden.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2396'>""That is evil news indeed," answered <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;news' adjectives='evil' verbs='answer;be;comfort;do' valence='5.455' arousal='4.035' dominance='5.5625'>Jagdschi</entity>; "but can I do nothing to comfort you?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2415'>[Illustration: "THE SEVEN VEILS FELL FROM HER"]</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2416'>"Once upon a time, a carpenter, a tailor, and a student set out together to see the world. After wandering about for some months they grew tired of travelling, and resolved to stay and rest in a small town that took their fancy. So they hired a little house, and looked about for work to do, returning at sunset to smoke their pipes and talk over the events of the day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2417'>"One night in the middle of summer it was hotter than usual, and the carpenter found himself unable to sleep. Instead of tossing about on his cushions, making himself more uncomfortable than he was already, the man wisely got up and drank some coffee and lit his long pipe. Suddenly his eye fell on some pieces of wood in a corner and, being very clever with his fingers, he had soon set up a perfect statue of a girl about fourteen years old. This so pleased and quieted him that he grew quite drowsy, and going back to bed fell fast asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2418'>"But the carpenter was not the only person who lay awake that night. Thunder was in the air, and the tailor became so restless that he thought he would go downstairs and cool his feet in the little fountain outside the garden door. To reach the door he had to pass through the room where the carpenter had sat and smoked, and against the wall he beheld standing a beautiful girl. He stood speechless for an instant before he ventured to touch her hand, when, to his amazement, he found that she was fashioned out of wood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2419'>""Ah! I can make you more beautiful still," said he. And fetching from a shelf a roll of yellow silk which he had bought that day from a merchant, he cut and draped and stitched, till at length a lovely robe clothed the slender figure.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2420'>"As dawn approached the student arose and prepared to go to the mosque with the first ray of sunlight. But, when he saw the maiden standing there, he fell on his knees and lifted his hands in ecstasy.</paragraph>

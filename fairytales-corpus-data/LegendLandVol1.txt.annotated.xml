	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>In those older, simpler days, when reading was a rare accomplishment, our many times great-grandparents would gather round the blazing fire of kitchen or hall on the long, dark winter nights and pass away the hours before bedtime in conversation and story-telling.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='65'>The old stories were told again and again. The children learned them in their earliest years and passed them on to their children and grandchildren in turn. And, as is natural, in all this telling the stories changed little by little. New and more familiar characters were introduced, or a story-teller with more vivid imagination than his fellows would add a bit here and there to make a better tale of it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>Then with the spread of education they began to die. When many folk could read and books grew cheap there was no longer the need to call upon memory for the old-fashioned romances.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>Yet there have always been those who loved the old tales best, and they wrote them down before it was too late, so that they might be preserved for ever. A few of them are retold briefly here.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='68'>All people should like the old stories; all nice people do. To them I commend these tales of Legend Land, in the hope that they may grow to love them and the countries about which they are written.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>Carved on one of the pews in the church of Zennor in West Cornwall is a strange figure of a mermaid. Depicted with flowing hair, a mirror in one hand and a comb in the other, the Zennor folk tell a strange story about her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>Years and years ago, they say, a beautiful and richly dressed lady used to attend the church sometimes. Nobody knew where she came from, although her unusual beauty and her glorious voice caused her to be the subject of discussion throughout the parish.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='81'>Years passed by, and Mathey"s strange disappearance was almost forgotten when, one Sunday morning, a ship cast anchor off Pendower Cove, near Zennor. The captain of the vessel was sitting idling on the deck when he heard a beautiful voice hailing him from the sea.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='83'>In alarm, the captain weighed anchor and stood out to sea, for sailors fear that mermaids will bring bad luck.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='93'>A thousand feet above sea level among the heather and bracken of Craddock Moor, four or five miles north of Liskeard, you may find to-day the remains of three ancient stone circles known as "The Hurlers." Antiquaries will tell you that the Druids first erected them, but the people of the countryside know better. From father to son, from grandparent to child, through long centuries, the story has been handed down of how "The Hurlers" came to be fixed in eternal stillness high up there above the little village of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='story;hurlers;village;father;son;stillness;child;grandparent' adjectives='high;little;eternal;long' verbs='be;fix;come;have;hand' valence='6.191875' arousal='3.734375' dominance='5.49125'>St. Cleer</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='95'>Then, as even to this day, the game of Hurling--a sort of primitive Rugby football--was a popular pastime with the people. Village used to play against village, with goals perhaps four or five miles apart. And the good folk of St. Cleer were as fond of the game as any of their neighbours--so fond, in fact, that they would play it on any and every occasion, despite the admonitions of their local saint and parson, after whom <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cleer;st.;admonition;neighbour;game;folk;saint;occasion;fact;parson' adjectives='fond;good;local' verbs='be;play;name' valence='6.51133333333' arousal='3.59733333333' dominance='5.93866666667'>the village</entity> was named.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='96'>Again and again he would notice that his little church was empty on Sunday mornings while the shouts and noise of a hard-fought Hurling match drifted across the moorland in through the open church door. Again and again he would take his flock to task for their godless ways and their Sabbath-breaking games. But it was of little use. For a Sunday or two they would be penitent and attend service. Then would come a fine morning, and a challenge perhaps from the Hurlers of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='patient;hurlers;honour;challenge;chance;moor;saint;parish;battle;lecture;side;man' adjectives='other;fine;young' verbs='go;do;come;decide' valence='5.605' arousal='3.91153846154' dominance='5.60538461538'>St. Ive</entity> or <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='patient;hurlers;honour;challenge;chance;moor;saint;parish;battle;lecture;side;man' adjectives='other;fine;young' verbs='go;do;come;decide' valence='5.605' arousal='3.91153846154' dominance='5.60538461538'>North Hill</entity>, on the other side of the moors, and the young men would decide to chance another lecture from the patient saint, and out they would go to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='patient;hurlers;honour;challenge;chance;moor;saint;parish;battle;lecture;side;man' adjectives='other;fine;young' verbs='go;do;come;decide' valence='5.605' arousal='3.91153846154' dominance='5.60538461538'>the hillside</entity> to do battle for the honour of their parish.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='97'>But even the patience of saints comes to an end at last, and good St. Cleer saw something more than words was needed to lead his people into the right way.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>He bade them cease their game at once and return to church. Some of them obeyed, wandering sheepishly off down the hill; some were defiant and told the worthy man to go back to his prayers and not to come up there to spoil sport.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>Then St. Cleer spoke in anger. Raising his staff he told them in solemn and awful tones that it should be as they had chosen. Since they preferred their game on the moor to their service in church, on the moor at their game they should stay for ever. He lowered his staff and to the horror of all onlookers the defiant ones were seen to be turned into stone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>Many centuries have passed since then. Time, wind and rain have weathered the stone men out of all semblance of humanity.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='106'>Some sixteen hundred years ago, so tradition tells, there lived in the South of Ireland a very holy man named Piran. Such was his piety that he was able to perform miracles. Once he fed ten Irish kings and their armies for ten days on end with three cows.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='124'>For two days the villagers sought high and low for the missing child, and then, on the morning of the third day, to the delight of the distracted parents, their boy was found sleeping peacefully upon a bed of fern within a few yards of the place where his mother had last seen him. He was perfectly well, quite happy, and entirely ignorant of the length of time that had elapsed. And he had a wonderful story to tell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='125'>While picking the flowers, he said, he had heard a bird singing in more beautiful tones than any he had heard before. Going into the wood to see what strange songster this was, the sound changed to most wonderful music which compelled him to follow it. Thus lured onward he came at length to the edge of an enchanted lake, and he noticed that night had fallen but that the sky was ablaze with huge stars. Then more stars rose up all around him, and, looking, he saw that each was in reality a pisky. These small people formed themselves into a procession, singing strange fascinating songs the while, and under the leadership of one who was more brilliant and more beautiful than the rest they led the boy through their dwelling place. This, he said, was like a palace. Crystal pillars supported arches hung with jewels which glistened with every colour of the rainbow. Far more wonderful, the child said, were the crystals than any he had seen in a Cornish mine.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>The piskies were very kind to him, and seemed to enjoy his wonder and astonishment at their gorgeous cave. They gave him a fairy meal of the purest honey spread on dainty little cakes, and when at last he grew tired numbers of the small folk fell to work to build him a bed of fern. Then, crowding around him, they sang him to sleep with a strange soothing lullaby, which for the rest of his life he was always just on the point of remembering, but which as certainly escaped him. He remembered nothing more until he was awakened and taken home to his parents.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='127'>The wise folk of St. Allen maintained that only a child of the finest character ever received such honour from the small people, and that the fact that they had shown him the secrets of their hidden dwelling augured that for ever afterwards they would keep him under their especial care. And so it was; the boy lived to a ripe old age and prospered amazingly. He never knew illness or misfortune, and died at last in his sleep; and those that were near him say that as he breathed his last a strange music filled the room. Some say that the piskies still haunt the woods and fields around Trefronick, but that they only show themselves to children and grown-ups of simple, trusting nature.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='147'>THE TASKS OF TREGEAGLE</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='148'>The name of the demon Tregeagle is a household word in nearly every part of Cornwall. His wild spirit rages of nights along the rocky coasts, across the bleak moors and through the sheltered valleys. For Tregeagle is a Cornish "Wandering Jew"; his spirit can never rest, since in life he was the most evil man the Duchy ever knew.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='149'>His story, as the legend has it, is that he was a man who amassed great wealth by robbing his neighbours in the cruellest manner. As he approached the end of his most evil life remorse seized him. There was no sin he had not committed, and hoping to escape from the just reward of so wicked a life, in the hereafter, he lavished money upon the Church and the poor, trusting to obtain the help of the holy priests to save him from the clutches of the Evil One.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='150'>The priests, ever anxious to save a soul, banded themselves together, and by constant prayer and powerful exorcisms kept the powers of darkness at bay, and Tregeagle died and was buried in St. Breock Church. But the demons were not so ready to give up what they felt was their lawful prey. An important lawsuit occurred shortly after his death, and as the judge was about to give his decision against the unjustly accused defendant, to the horror of all in court, the gaunt figure of the dead Tregeagle stalked into the room. His evidence saved the defendant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='151'>Now Tregeagle being brought from the grave, despite the honesty of his mission, placed himself once more in danger of the demons. The defendant, who had raised the spirit, calmly left him to the Churchmen to put once more to rest, and after a long conference, presided over by the Prior of Bodmin, it was decided that the only hope of ultimate peace for the evil man"s spirit was that he be set to some task which might last until the Day of Judgment. And so long as he worked unceasingly at that task he might still hope for salvation.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='152'>So the task appointed him was to empty out Dozmary Pool, a gloomy lake on the Bodmin Moors, with a limpet-shell with a hole in it. For years Tregeagle laboured at this, until one day during a terrible storm he ceased work for a moment. Then the demons descended upon him. He fled from his pursuers, and only escaped them by leaping right across the lake--for demons cannot cross water--and rushing for sanctuary to the little chapel on the Roche Rock, where he managed just in time to get his head in at the east window. But the howls of the demons outside, and the roaring of the terrified Tregeagle within, made the life of the unfortunate priest of the Roche chapel unbearable, and he appealed to his brethren of the Church to do something about it. So they bound the wicked spirit with holy spells and took him safely across to the north coast, where another task was set him. He was to weave a truss of sand and spin a sand rope to bind it with. But as soon as he started on his work the winds or the waves destroyed it, and the luckless creature"s roars of anger so disturbed <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wilder;work;wave;s;part;saint;anger;wind;creature' adjectives='luckless;holy' verbs='be;disturb;roar;move;start;take;destroy;prevail' valence='5.30428571429' arousal='4.35952380952' dominance='5.32380952381'>the countryside</entity> that the holy <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wilder;work;wave;s;part;saint;anger;wind;creature' adjectives='luckless;holy' verbs='be;disturb;roar;move;start;take;destroy;prevail' valence='5.30428571429' arousal='4.35952380952' dominance='5.32380952381'>St. Petroc</entity> was prevailed upon to move him once more, to a wilder part of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wilder;work;wave;s;part;saint;anger;wind;creature' adjectives='luckless;holy' verbs='be;disturb;roar;move;start;take;destroy;prevail' valence='5.30428571429' arousal='4.35952380952' dominance='5.32380952381'>the country</entity>, and the saint took him to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wilder;work;wave;s;part;saint;anger;wind;creature' adjectives='luckless;holy' verbs='be;disturb;roar;move;start;take;destroy;prevail' valence='5.30428571429' arousal='4.35952380952' dominance='5.32380952381'>the coast</entity> near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wilder;work;wave;s;part;saint;anger;wind;creature' adjectives='luckless;holy' verbs='be;disturb;roar;move;start;take;destroy;prevail' valence='5.30428571429' arousal='4.35952380952' dominance='5.32380952381'>Helston</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='256'>The celebration of "Furry Day," on May 8th each year, at Helston, in South Cornwall, is one of the most interesting survivals of an old custom in the whole country. On "Furry Day" the whole town makes holiday. The people go first into the surrounding country to gather flowers and branches, and return about noon, when the Furry dance begins and continues until dusk; the merrymakers, hand in hand, dancing through the streets and in and out of the houses, the doors of which are kept open for the purpose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='257'>The origin of the word "Furry," and of the song and dance, is lost in the ages. Some authorities hold that these celebrations are a survival of the old Roman Floralia, others that it began in celebration of a great victory gained by the Cornish over the Saxons. The words and music, as they have come down to us, show many signs of Elizabethan origin. The music reproduced here is from a very old setting and contains many crude harmonies unfamiliar at the present day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='258'>There is one line of the song, "God bless Aunt Mary Moses," that most people will find incomprehensible. It refers to the Virgin Mary, "Aunt" being among the Cornish a term of great respect; "Moses" being a corruption of the old Cornish word "Mowes," a maid. "<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='maid;mary' adjectives='' verbs='mean' valence='3.905' arousal='4.0' dominance='5.185'>Mary Moses</entity>" means literally "Mary the Maid."</paragraph>

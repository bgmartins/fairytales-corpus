	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='10'>IN a second gleaning of the fields of Fairy Land we cannot expect to find a second Perrault. But there are good stories enough left, and it is hoped that some in the Red Fairy Book may have the attraction of being less familiar than many of the old friends. The tales have been translated, or, in the case of those from Madame d"Aulnoy"s long stories, adapted, by Mrs. Hunt from the Norse, by Miss Minnie Wright from Madame d"Aulnoy, by Mrs. Lang and Miss Bruce from other French sources, by Miss May Sellar, Miss Farquharson, and Miss Blackley from the German, while the story of "Sigurd" is condensed by the Editor from Mr. William Morris"s prose version of the "Volsunga Saga." The Editor has to thank his friend, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='golden;hood;regard;sillies;permission;la;pied;piper;drakestail;version;editor;privilege;tradition;friend' adjectives='little;same' verbs='reproduce;thank;have' valence='5.93' arousal='3.85285714286' dominance='5.79'>M.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='57'>ONCE upon a time there lived in the village of Montignies-sur-Roc a little cow-boy, without either father or mother.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='58'>As he had a white skin, blue eyes, and hair that curled all over his head, the village girls used to cry after him, "Well, Star Gazer, what are you doing?" and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nothing;way' adjectives='' verbs='answer;go;look;turn' valence='5.94' arousal='3.80166666667' dominance='5.635'>Michael</entity> would answer, "Oh, nothing," and go on his way without even turning to look at them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='59'>The fact was he thought them very ugly, with their sun-burnt necks, their great red hands, their coarse petticoats and their wooden shoes. He had heard that somewhere in the world there were girls whose necks were white and whose hands were small, who were always dressed in the finest silks and laces, and were called princesses, and while his companions round <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lace;hand;flame;companion;nothing;world;girl;silk;princess;happiness;neck' adjectives='small;white;finest;common;everyday' verbs='be;dream;marry;fancy;see;hear;have;call;dress;round' valence='6.29875' arousal='4.195625' dominance='5.6290625'>the fire</entity> saw nothing in the flames but common everyday fancies, he dreamed that he had the happiness to marry a princess.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='61'>One morning about the middle of August, just at mid-day when the sun was hottest, Michael ate his dinner of a piece of dry bread, and went to sleep under an oak. And while he slept he dreamt that there appeared before him a beautiful lady, dressed in a robe of cloth of gold, who said to him: "Go to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cloth;robe;lady;princess;gold' adjectives='beautiful' verbs='appear;dress;marry;say;sleep;go;dream' valence='6.33833333333' arousal='4.51111111111' dominance='5.69444444444'>the castle</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cloth;robe;lady;princess;gold' adjectives='beautiful' verbs='appear;dress;marry;say;sleep;go;dream' valence='6.33833333333' arousal='4.51111111111' dominance='5.69444444444'>Beloeil</entity>, and there you shall marry a princess."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>That evening the little cow-boy, who had been thinking a great deal about the advice of the lady in the golden dress, told his dream to the farm people. But, as was natural, they only laughed at the Star Gazer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='63'>The next day at the same hour he went to sleep again under the same tree. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='princess;time' adjectives='' verbs='go;say;marry;appear' valence='6.01916666667' arousal='4.3875' dominance='5.56666666667'>The lady</entity> appeared to him a second time, and said: "Go to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='princess;time' adjectives='' verbs='go;say;marry;appear' valence='6.01916666667' arousal='4.3875' dominance='5.56666666667'>the castle</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='princess;time' adjectives='' verbs='go;say;marry;appear' valence='6.01916666667' arousal='4.3875' dominance='5.56666666667'>Beloeil</entity>, and you shall marry a princess."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='64'>In the evening Michael told his friends that he had dreamed the same dream again, but they only laughed at him more than before. "Never mind," he thought to himself; "if <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time' adjectives='' verbs='do;tell;mind;think;appear' valence='5.55538461538' arousal='4.07538461538' dominance='5.48769230769'>the lady</entity> appears to me a third time, I will do as she tells me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>The following day, to the great astonishment of all <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='voice;singing;astonishment;o;clock' adjectives='great' verbs='be;hear' valence='6.05166666667' arousal='3.78166666667' dominance='5.59'>the village</entity>, about two o"clock in the afternoon a voice was heard singing:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>"Raleo, raleo, How the cattle go!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='67'>It was the little cow-boy driving his herd back to the byre.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='72'>It was well known for full twenty miles round that there lived in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beauty;presence;bed;princess;mile;blood;mattress;pea' adjectives='beautiful;full;proud;royal;sensitive;wonderful;such' verbs='be;feel;live;know;have;round;lay' valence='6.206' arousal='3.95866666667' dominance='5.75133333333'>the castle</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beauty;presence;bed;princess;mile;blood;mattress;pea' adjectives='beautiful;full;proud;royal;sensitive;wonderful;such' verbs='be;feel;live;know;have;round;lay' valence='6.206' arousal='3.95866666667' dominance='5.75133333333'>Beloeil</entity> twelve princesses of wonderful beauty, and as proud as they were beautiful, and who were besides so very sensitive and of such truly royal blood, that they would have felt at once the presence of a pea in their beds, even if the mattresses had been laid over it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>It was whispered about that they led exactly the lives that princesses ought to lead, sleeping far into the morning, and never getting up till mid-day. They had twelve beds all in the same room, but what was very extraordinary was the fact that though they were locked in by triple bolts, every morning their satin shoes were found worn into holes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='74'>When they were asked what they had been doing all night, they always answered that they had been asleep; and, indeed, no noise was ever heard in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='noise;shoe' adjectives='' verbs='be;do;answer;hear;wear;have;ask' valence='5.80941176471' arousal='3.57941176471' dominance='5.65176470588'>the room</entity>, yet the shoes could not wear themselves out alone!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='75'>At last the Duke of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='duke;daughter;wife;proclamation;shoe;trumpet' adjectives='last' verbs='sound;be;make;discover;wear;order;choose' valence='6.075' arousal='3.97625' dominance='5.844375'>Beloeil</entity> ordered the trumpet to be sounded, and a proclamation to be made that whoever could discover how his daughters wore out their shoes should choose one of them for his wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='76'>On hearing the proclamation a number of princes arrived at the castle to try their luck. They watched all night behind the open door of the princesses, but when the morning came they had all disappeared, and no one could tell what had become of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>IV</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='78'>When he reached the castle, Michael went straight to the gardener and offered his services. Now it happened that <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='boy;curl;princess;gardener;face' adjectives='golden;pretty;sturdy' verbs='be;look;do;please;send;think;take;have;happen;agree' valence='6.4025' arousal='3.985' dominance='5.9545'>the garden</entity> boy had just been sent away, and though the Star Gazer did not look very sturdy, the gardener agreed to take him, as he thought that his pretty face and golden curls would please the princesses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='79'>The first thing he was told was that when the princesses got up he was to present each one with a bouquet, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bouquet;thing;nothing;princess' adjectives='unpleasant;more' verbs='do;be;get;tell;have;think' valence='5.98117647059' arousal='3.94941176471' dominance='5.58823529412'>Michael</entity> thought that if he had nothing more unpleasant to do than that he should get on very well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>Accordingly he placed himself behind the door of the princesses" room, with the twelve bouquets in a basket. He gave one to each of the sisters, and they took them without even deigning to look at the lad, except Lina the youngest, who fixed her large black eyes as soft as velvet on him, and exclaimed, "Oh, how pretty he is--our new flower boy!" The rest all burst out laughing, and the eldest pointed out that a princess ought never to lower herself by looking at a garden boy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='81'>Now Michael knew quite well what had happened to all the princes, but notwithstanding, the beautiful eyes of the Princess Lina inspired him with a violent longing to try his fate. Unhappily he did not dare to come forward, being afraid that he should only be jeered at, or even turned away from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='account;impudence' adjectives='afraid' verbs='do;be;jeer;turn;come;dare' valence='5.244' arousal='4.073' dominance='5.205'>the castle</entity> on account of his impudence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>V</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>Nevertheless, the Star Gazer had another dream. The lady in the golden dress appeared to him once more, holding in one hand two young laurel trees, a cherry laurel and a rose laurel, and in the other hand a little golden rake, a little golden bucket, and a silken towel. She thus addressed him:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>"Plant these two laurels in two large pots, rake them over with the rake, water them with the bucket, and wipe them with the towel. When they have grown as tall as a girl of fifteen, say to each of them, ""My beautiful laurel, with the golden rake I have raked you, with the golden bucket I have watered you, with the silken towel I have wiped you."" Then after that ask anything you choose, and the laurels will give it to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='85'>Michael thanked the lady in the golden dress, and when he woke he found the two laurel bushes beside him. So he carefully obeyed the orders he had been given by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='order' adjectives='' verbs='be;obey;have;give' valence='6.27166666667' arousal='3.81' dominance='5.63333333333'>the lady</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='86'>The trees grew very fast, and when they were as tall as a girl of fifteen he said to the cherry laurel, "My lovely cherry laurel, with the golden rake I have raked thee, with the golden bucket I have watered thee, with the silken towel I have wiped thee. Teach me how to become invisible." Then there instantly appeared on the laurel a pretty white flower, which <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='laurel;flower;button-hole' adjectives='white' verbs='gather;appear;stick' valence='6.06' arousal='4.03857142857' dominance='5.88285714286'>Michael</entity> gathered and stuck into his button-hole.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>VI</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='88'>That evening, when the princesses went upstairs to bed, he followed them barefoot, so that he might make no noise, and hid himself under one of the twelve beds, so as not to take up much room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='89'>The princesses began at once to open their wardrobes and boxes. They took out of them the most magnificent dresses, which they put on before their mirrors, and when they had finished, turned themselves all round to admire their appearances.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>Michael could see nothing from his hiding-place, but he could hear everything, and he listened to the princesses laughing and jumping with pleasure. At last the eldest said, "Be quick, my sisters, our partners will be impatient." At the end of an hour, when the Star Gazer heard no more noise, he peeped out and saw the twelve sisters in splendid garments, with their satin shoes on their feet, and in their hands the bouquets he had brought them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>"Are you ready?" asked the eldest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>"Yes," replied the other eleven in chorus, and they took their places one by one behind her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='93'>Then the eldest Princess clapped her hands three times and a trap door opened.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='199'>ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen whose children had all died, first one and then another, until at last only one little daughter remained, and the Queen was at her wits" end to know where to find a really good nurse who would take care of her, and bring her up. A herald was sent who blew a trumpet at every street corner, and commanded all the best nurses to appear before the Queen, that she might choose one for the little Princess. So on the appointed day the whole palace was crowded with nurses, who came from the four corners of the world to offer themselves, until the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='world;palace;wood;half;corner;nurse' adjectives='shady;whole' verbs='appoint;be;crowd;offer;sit;bring;see;come;declare' valence='5.66346153846' arousal='3.88538461538' dominance='5.51153846154'>Queen</entity> declared that if she was ever to see the half of them, they must be brought out to her, one by one, as she sat in a shady wood near <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='world;palace;wood;half;corner;nurse' adjectives='shady;whole' verbs='appoint;be;crowd;offer;sit;bring;see;come;declare' valence='5.66346153846' arousal='3.88538461538' dominance='5.51153846154'>the palace</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='200'>This was accordingly done, and the nurses, after they had made their curtsey to the King and Queen, ranged themselves in a line before her that she might choose. Most of them were fair and fat and charming, but there was one who was dark-skinned and ugly, and spoke a strange language which nobody could understand. The Queen wondered how she dared offer herself, and she was told to go away, as she certainly would not do. Upon which she muttered something and passed on, but hid herself in a hollow tree, from which she could see all that happened. The Queen, without giving her another thought, chose a pretty rosy-faced nurse, but no sooner was her choice made than a snake, which was hidden in the grass, bit that very nurse on her foot, so that she fell down as if dead. The Queen was very much vexed by this accident, but she soon selected another, who was just stepping forward when an eagle flew by and dropped a large tortoise upon her head, which was cracked in pieces like an egg-shell. At this the Queen was much horrified; nevertheless, she chose a third time, but with no better fortune, for the nurse, moving quickly, ran into the branch of a tree and blinded herself with a thorn. Then the Queen in dismay cried that there must be some malignant influence at work, and that she would choose no more that day; and she had just risen to return to the palace when she heard peals of malicious laughter behind her, and turning round saw the ugly stranger whom she had dismissed, who was making very merry over the disasters and mocking everyone, but especially the Queen. This annoyed Her Majesty very much, and she was about to order that she should be arrested, when the witch--for she was a witch--with two blows from a wand summoned a chariot of fire drawn by winged dragons, and was whirled off through the air uttering threats and cries.

Of all the fairies the Queen knew, only five were able to come on the day appointed, but they began immediately to bestow gifts upon the Princess. One promised that she should be perfectly beautiful, the second that she should understand anything--no matter what--the first time it was explained to her, the third that she should sing like a nightingale, the fourth that she should succeed in everything she undertook, and the fifth was opening her mouth to speak when a tremendous rumbling was heard in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='anything;everything;soot;matter;mouth;time;carabosse;nightingale' adjectives='beautiful;tremendous' verbs='be;come;explain;cry;cover;rumble;succeed;understand;undertake;sing;hear;promise;open;roll;speak' valence='5.8971875' arousal='4.05625' dominance='5.6221875'>the chimney</entity>, and Carabosse, all covered with soot, came rolling down, crying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='207'>"I say that she shall be the unluckiest of the unlucky until she is twenty years old."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='208'>Then the Queen and all the fairies began to beg and beseech her to think better of it, and not be so unkind to the poor little Princess, who had never done her any harm. But the ugly old Fairy only grunted and made no answer. So the last Fairy, who had not yet given her gift, tried to mend matters by promising the Princess a long and happy life after the fatal time was over. At this Carabosse laughed maliciously, and climbed away up the chimney, leaving them all in great consternation, and especially the Queen. However, she entertained the fairies splendidly, and gave them beautiful ribbons, of which they are very fond, in addition to the other presents.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='209'>When they were going away the oldest Fairy said that they were of opinion that it would be best to shut the Princess up in some place, with her waiting-women, so that she might not see anyone else until she was twenty years old. So the King had a tower built on purpose. It had no windows, so it was lighted with wax candles, and the only way into it was by an underground passage, which had iron doors only twenty feet apart, and guards were posted everywhere.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='210'>The Princess had been named Mayblossom, because she was as fresh and blooming as Spring itself, and she grew up tall and beautiful, and everything she did and said was charming. Every time the King and Queen came to see her they were more delighted with her than before, but though she was weary of the tower, and often begged them to take her away from it, they always refused. The Princess"s nurse, who had never left her, sometimes told her about the world outside the tower, and though the Princess had never seen anything for herself, yet she always understood exactly, thanks to the second Fairy"s gift. Often <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='6.14333333333' arousal='4.64333333333' dominance='6.15'>the King</entity> said to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say' valence='6.14333333333' arousal='4.64333333333' dominance='6.15'>Queen</entity>:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='5' num='212'>And the Queen laughed until she was tired at the idea of having outwitted the old Fairy. They had caused the Princess"s portrait to be painted and sent to all the neighbouring Courts, for in four days she would have completed her twentieth year, and it was time to decide whom she should marry. All the town was rejoicing at the thought of the Princess"s approaching freedom, and when the news came that King Merlin was sending his ambassador to ask her in marriage for his son, they were still more delighted.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='213'>"What an unhappy creature I am," she cried, "to be shut up in this dismal tower as if I had committed some crime!

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='216'>Then the nurse and all the others cried harder than ever, and said everything they could think of to turn the Princess from her idea.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='217'>After scratching and scraping all day and all night, they presently made a hole through which they could, with great difficulty, push a very slender needle, and out of this the Princess looked at the daylight for the first time.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='218'>At the head of it rode Fanfaronade himself upon a white horse, which pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='223'>They had hardly begun to get the Princess ready when a dwarf arrived, mounted upon an elephant. He came from the five fairies, and brought for the Princess a crown, a sceptre, and a robe of golden brocade, with a petticoat marvellously embroidered with butterflies" wings. They also sent a casket of jewels, so splendid that no one had ever seen anything like it before, and the Queen was perfectly dazzled when she opened it. But the Princess scarcely gave a glance to any of these treasures, for she thought of nothing but Fanfaronade. The Dwarf was rewarded with a gold piece, and decorated with so many ribbons that it was hardly possible to see him at all.

The Queen put her royal mantle over her head, and all the princesses did the same with their trains. Mayblossom was just about to follow their example when a terrific croaking, as of an immense army of crows, rooks, ravens, screech-owls, and all birds of ill-omen was heard, and at the same instant a huge owl skimmed up to the Princess, and threw over her a scarf woven of spiders" webs and embroidered with bats" wings. And then peals of mocking laughter rang through the air, and they guessed that this was another of the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='joke;s;air;peal;carabosse;laughter' adjectives='unpleasant' verbs='be;ring;guess;mock' valence='5.914' arousal='4.581' dominance='5.445'>Fairy</entity> Carabosse"s unpleasant jokes.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='227'>While she lamented in this way, and everybody was as wet as if they had been dragged through a river, the Princess still thought of nothing but the ambassador, and just at this moment he appeared before her, with the King, and there was a great blowing of trumpets, and all the people shouted louder than ever. Fanfaronade was not generally at a loss for something to say, but when he saw the Princess, she was so much more beautiful and majestic than he had expected that he could only stammer out a few words, and entirely forgot the harangue which he had been learning for months, and knew well enough to have repeated it in his sleep. To gain time to remember at least part of it, he made several low bows to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='curtsey;bow;embarrassment;part;time;side' adjectives='evident;several;low;least' verbs='relieve;remember;make;drop;stop;say;gain;think' valence='5.518125' arousal='3.914375' dominance='5.53125'>Princess</entity>, who on her side dropped half-a-dozen curtseys without stopping to think, and then said, to relieve his evident embarrassment:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='229'>Upon this the Ambassador found his tongue, and replied gallantly that the Fairy had evidently foreseen the flames that would be kindled by the bright eyes of the Princess, and had sent this deluge to extinguish them.

But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='danger;fury;people;carbuncle;unkindness;something;property' adjectives='invisible;good' verbs='be;draw;run;render;share;s;see;have;go;hide;reproach;find' valence='5.63608695652' arousal='4.20739130435' dominance='5.48434782609'>Fanfaronade</entity>, seeing that she had found something good, and was not going to share it with him, ran after her in such a fury that she hastily drew out the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='danger;fury;people;carbuncle;unkindness;something;property' adjectives='invisible;good' verbs='be;draw;run;render;share;s;see;have;go;hide;reproach;find' valence='5.63608695652' arousal='4.20739130435' dominance='5.48434782609'>Queen</entity>"s carbuncle, which had the property of rendering people invisible if they were in danger, and when she was safely hidden from him she reproached him gently for his unkindness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='288'>Meanwhile Admiral Cocked-Hat had despatched Jack-the-Chatterer-of-the-Straw-Boots, Courier in Ordinary to the Prime Minister, to tell the King that the Princess and the Ambassador had landed on Squirrel Island, but that not knowing the country he had not pursued them, for fear of being captured by concealed enemies. Their Majesties were overjoyed at the news, and the King sent for a great book, each leaf of which was eight ells long. It was the work of a very clever Fairy, and contained a description of the whole earth. He very soon found that <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='uninhabited' verbs='be;find' valence='6.194' arousal='3.848' dominance='5.346'>Squirrel Island</entity> was uninhabited.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='289'>"Go," said he, to Jack-the-Chatterer, "tell the Admiral from me to land at once. I am surprised at his not having done so sooner." As soon as this message reached the fleet, every preparation was made for war, and the noise was so great that it reached the ears of the Princess, who at once flew to protect her lover. As he was not very brave he accepted her aid gladly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='290'>"You stand behind me," said she, "and I will hold the carbuncle which will make us invisible, and with the King"s dagger I can protect you from the enemy." So when the soldiers landed they could see nothing, but the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='dagger;enchantment;confusion;order;soldier;sand;boat;nothing;admiral;retreat;man' adjectives='great;last;insensible' verbs='sound;be;land;give;get;see;fall;touch' valence='5.8692' arousal='4.1548' dominance='5.4316'>Princess</entity> touched them one after another with the dagger, and they fell insensible upon the sand, so that at last the Admiral, seeing that there was some enchantment, hastily gave orders for a retreat to be sounded, and got his men back into their boats in great confusion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='291'>Fanfaronade, being once more left with the Princess, began to think that if he could get rid of her, and possess himself of the carbuncle and the dagger, he would be able to make his escape. So as they walked back over the cliffs he gave the Princess a great push, hoping she would fall into the sea; but she stepped aside so quickly that he only succeeded in overbalancing himself, and over he went, and sank to the bottom of the sea like a lump of lead, and was never heard of any more. While the Princess was still looking after him in horror, her attention was attracted by a rushing noise over her head, and looking up she saw two chariots approaching rapidly from opposite directions. One was bright and glittering, and drawn by swans and peacocks, while the Fairy who sat in it was beautiful as a sunbeam; but the other was drawn by bats and ravens, and contained a frightful little Dwarf, who was dressed in a snake"s skin, and wore a great toad upon her head for a hood. The chariots met with a frightful crash in mid-air, and the Princess looked on in breathless anxiety while a furious battle took place between the lovely Fairy with her golden lance, and the hideous little Dwarf and her rusty pike. But very soon it was evident that the Beauty had the best of it, and the Dwarf turned her bats" heads and flickered away in great confusion, while the Fairy came down to where the Princess stood, and said, smiling, "You see Princess, I have completely routed that malicious old Carabosse. Will you believe it! she actually wanted to claim authority over you for ever, because you came out of the tower four days before the twenty years were ended. However, I think I have settled her pretensions, and I hope you will be very happy and enjoy the freedom I have won for you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='292'>The Princess thanked her heartily, and then the Fairy despatched one of her peacocks to her palace to bring a gorgeous robe for Mayblossom, who certainly needed it, for her own was torn to shreds by the thorns and briars. Another peacock was sent to the Admiral to tell him that he could now land in perfect safety, which he at once did, bringing all his men with him, even to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='peacock;spit;dinner;s;safety;admiral;man' adjectives='perfect' verbs='be;land;do;send;snatch;bring;roast;pass;happen;tell' valence='5.6275' arousal='3.9735' dominance='5.5975'>Jack-the-Chatterer</entity>, who, happening to pass the spit upon which the Admiral"s dinner was roasting, snatched it up and brought it with him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='293'>Admiral Cocked-Hat was immensely surprised when he came upon the golden chariot, and still more so to see two lovely ladies walking under the trees a little farther away. When he reached them, of course he recognised the Princess, and he went down on his knees and kissed her hand quite joyfully. Then she presented him to the Fairy, and told him how Carabosse had been finally routed, and he thanked and congratulated the Fairy, who was most gracious to him. While they were talking she cried suddenly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='294'>"I declare I smell a savoury dinner."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='295'>"Why yes, Madam, here it is," said Jack-the-Chatterer, holding up the spit, where all the pheasants and partridges were frizzling. "Will your Highness please to taste any of them?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='296'>"By all means," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='meal;means' adjectives='good;glad' verbs='be;say' valence='6.58333333333' arousal='4.27111111111' dominance='6.29222222222'>Fairy</entity>, "especially as the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='meal;means' adjectives='good;glad' verbs='be;say' valence='6.58333333333' arousal='4.27111111111' dominance='6.29222222222'>Princess</entity> will certainly be glad of a good meal."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='297'>So the Admiral sent back to his ship for everything that was needful, and they feasted merrily under the trees. By the time they had finished the peacock had come back with a robe for the Princess, in which the Fairy arrayed her. It was of green and gold brocade, embroidered with pearls and rubies, and her long golden hair was tied back with strings of diamonds and emeralds, and crowned with flowers. The Fairy made her mount beside her in the golden chariot, and took her on board the Admiral"s ship, where she bade her farewell, sending many messages of friendship to the Queen, and bidding the Princess tell her that she was the fifth Fairy who had attended the christening. Then salutes were fired, the fleet weighed anchor, and very soon they reached the port. Here the King and Queen were waiting, and they received the Princess with such joy and kindness that she could not get a word in edgewise, to say how sorry she was for having run away with such a very poor spirited Ambassador. But, after all, it must have been all Carabosse"s fault. Just at this lucky moment who should arrive but King Merlin"s son, who had become uneasy at not receiving any news from his Ambassador, and so had started himself with a magnificent escort of a thousand horsemen, and thirty body-guards in gold and scarlet uniforms, to see what could have happened. As he was a hundred times handsomer and braver than the Ambassador, the Princess found she could like him very much. So the wedding was held at once, with so much splendour and rejoicing that all the previous misfortunes were quite forgotten.(1)</paragraph>

So after a while he came to a great highway, which was so smooth that an egg might have been rolled along it without breaking. Halvor followed this, and when evening drew near he saw a big castle far away in the distance, and there were lights in it.

At length I came to an old kiln, and being much fatigued I went up and lay on the ribs. I had not been long there when I saw three witches coming in with three bags of gold. Each put their bags of gold under their heads, as if to sleep. I heard one of them say to the other that if the Black Thief came on them while they slept, he would not leave them a penny. I found by their discourse that everybody had got my name into their mouth, though I kept silent as death during their discourse. At length they fell fast asleep, and then I stole softly down, and seeing some turf convenient, I placed one under each of their heads, and off I went, with their gold, as fast as I could.</paragraph>

Seeing they did not appear in any formidable shape, I was more than once resolved to attack them, thinking that with my broad sword I could easily destroy them. But considering again that it was perhaps still in their power to become alive again, I gave over the attempt and climbed with difficulty up a tree, bringing my sword in my hand and all the gold along with me. However, when they came to the tree they found what I had done, and making further use of their hellish art, one of them was changed into a smith"s anvil and another into a piece of iron, of which the third soon made a hatchet. Having the hatchet made, she fell to cutting down the tree, and in the course of an hour it began to shake with me. At length it began to bend, and I found that one or two blows at the most would put it down. I then began to think that my death was inevitable, considering that those who were capable of doing so much would soon end my life; but just as she had the stroke drawn that would terminate my fate, the cock crew, and the witches disappeared, having resumed their natural shapes for fear of being known, and I got safe off with my bags of gold.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='598'>"My way of living, sir," says the Black Thief, "was not good, as I told you before; and being at a certain time fairly run out of cash, and meeting with no enterprise worthy of notice, I was reduced to great straits. At length a rich bishop died in the neighbourhood I was then in, and I heard he was interred with a great deal of jewels and rich robes upon him, all which I intended in a short time to be master of. Accordingly that very night I set about it, and coming to the place, I understood he was placed at the further end of a long dark vault, which I slowly entered. I had not gone in far until I heard a foot coming towards me with a quick pace, and although naturally bold and daring, yet, thinking of the deceased bishop and the crime I was engaged in, I lost courage, and ran towards the entrance of the vault. I had retreated but a few paces when I observed, between me and the light, the figure of a tall black man standing in the entrance. Being in great fear and not knowing how to pass, I fired a pistol at him, and he immediately fell across the entrance. Perceiving he still retained the figure of a mortal man, I began to imagine that it could not be the bishop"s ghost; recovering myself therefore from the fear I was in, I ventured to the upper end of the vault, where I found a large bundle, and upon further examination I found that the corpse was already rifled, and that which I had taken to be a ghost was no more than one of his own clergy. I was then very sorry that I had the misfortune to kill him, but it then could not be helped. I took up the bundle that contained everything belonging to the corpse that was valuable, intending to take my departure from this melancholy abode; but just as I came to the mouth of the entrance I saw the guards of the place coming towards me, and distinctly heard them saying that they would look in the vault, for that the Black Thief would think little of robbing the corpse if he was anywhere in the place. I did not then know in what manner to act, for if I was seen I would surely lose my life, as everybody had a look-out at that time, and because there was no person bold enough to come in on me. I knew very well on the first sight of me that could be got, I would be shot like a dog. However, I had not time to lose. I took and raised up the man which I had killed, as if he was standing on his feet, and I, crouching behind him, bore him up as well as I could, so that the guards readily saw him as they came up to the vault. Seeing the man in black, one of the men cried that was the Black Thief, and, presenting his piece, fired at the man, at which I let him fall, and crept into a little dark corner myself, that was at the entrance of the place. When they saw the man fall, they ran all into the vault, and never stopped until they were at the end of it, for fear, as I thought, that there might be some others along with him that was killed. But while they were busy inspecting the corpse and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='corpse;thief;power' adjectives='busy;black' verbs='be;slip;inspect;see;have;miss' valence='4.95307692308' arousal='4.29307692308' dominance='4.89538461538'>the vault</entity> to see what they could miss, I slipped out, and, once away, and still away; but they never had the Black Thief in their power since."</paragraph>

You may be certain I was in great pain, but the fear of being killed prevented me from making any complaint. However, when he had eaten all he began to drink hot liquors in great abundance, so that in a short time he could not hold up his head, but threw himself on a large creel he had made for the purpose, and fell fast asleep.

The robbers had heard of this, so they told the youth that if he were able to steal the ox from him on the way, without his knowing, and without doing him any harm, he should have leave to be their servant-man. So the youth set off, taking with him a pretty shoe with a silver buckle that was lying about in the house. He put this in the road by which the man must go with his ox, and then went into the wood and hid himself under a bush.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='648'>So he went and searched and searched for the other shoe for a long, long time, but no shoe was to be found, and at last he was forced to go back with the one which he had.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='649'>In the meantime the youth had taken the ox and gone off with it. When the man got there and found that his ox was gone, he began to weep and wail, for he was afraid that when his old woman got to know she would be the death of him. But all at once it came into his head to go home and get the other ox, and drive it to the town, and take good care that his old wife knew nothing about it. So he did this; he went home and took the ox without his wife"s knowing about it, and went on his way to the town with it. But the robbers they knew it well, because they got out their magic.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='654'>"How I should like to know if you really were so sick at heart that you hanged yourself there, or if it is only a hobgoblin that"s before me!" said the man. "Ah, well! you may hang there for me, whether you are a hobgoblin or not," and on he went with his ox.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='655'>Once more the youth did just as he had done twice already; jumped down from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='youth;cut' adjectives='middle;short' verbs='jump;do;hang;run;have' valence='5.56785714286' arousal='3.98285714286' dominance='5.445'>the tree</entity>, ran by a short cut through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='youth;cut' adjectives='middle;short' verbs='jump;do;hang;run;have' valence='5.56785714286' arousal='3.98285714286' dominance='5.445'>the wood</entity>, and again hanged himself in the very middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='youth;cut' adjectives='middle;short' verbs='jump;do;hang;run;have' valence='5.56785714286' arousal='3.98285714286' dominance='5.445'>the road</entity> before him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='656'>But when the man once more saw this he said to himself, "What a bad business this is! Can they all have been so heavy-hearted that they have all three hanged themselves? No, I can"t believe that it is anything but witchcraft! But I will know the truth," he said; "if the two others are still hanging there it is true but if they are not it"s nothing else but witchcraft."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='657'>So he tied up his ox and ran back to see if they really were hanging there. While he was going, and looking up at every tree as he went, the youth leapt down and took his ox and went off with it. Any one may easily imagine what a fury the man fell into when he came back and saw that his ox was gone. He wept and he raged, but at last he took comfort and told himself that the best thing to do was to go home and take the third ox, without letting his wife know anything about it, and then try to sell it so well that he got a good sum of money for it. So he went home and took the third ox, and drove it off without his wife knowing anything about it. But the robbers knew all about it, and they told the youth that if he could steal this as he had stolen the two others, he should be master of the whole troop. So the youth set out and went to the wood, and when the man was coming along with the ox he began to bellow loudly, just like a great ox somewhere inside the wood. When the man heard that he was right glad, for he fancied he recognised the voice of his big bullock, and thought that now he should find both of them again. So he tied up the third, and ran away off the road to look for them in the wood. In the meantime the youth went away with the third ox. When the man returned and found that he had lost that too, he fell into such a rage that there was no bounds to it. He wept and lamented, and for many days he did not dare to go home again, for he was afraid that the old woman would slay him outright. The robbers, also, were not very well pleased at this, for they were forced to own that the youth was at the head of them all. So one day they made up their minds to set to work to do something which it was not in his power to accomplish, and they all took to the road together, and left him at home alone. When they were well out of the house, the first thing that he did was to drive the oxen out on the road, whereupon they all ran home again to the man from whom he had stolen them, and right glad was the husbandman to see them. Then he brought out all the horses the robbers had, and loaded them with the most valuable things which he could find--vessels of gold and of silver, and clothes and other magnificent things--and then he told the old woman to greet the robbers from him and thank them from him, and say that he had gone away, and that they would have a great deal of difficulty in finding him again, and with that he drove the horses out of the courtyard. After a long, long time he came to the road on which he was travelling when he came to the robbers. And when he had got very near home, and was in sight of the house where his father lived, he put on a uniform which he had found among the things he had taken from the robbers, and which was made just like a general"s, and drove into the yard just as if he were a great man. Then he entered <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lodging' adjectives='' verbs='ask;find;enter' valence='6.136' arousal='4.05' dominance='6.146'>the house</entity> and asked if he could find a lodging there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='658'>"No, indeed you can"t!" said his father. "How could I possibly be able to lodge such a great gentleman as you? It is all that I can do to find clothes and bedding for myself, and wretched they are."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='659'>"You were always a hard man," said the youth, "and hard you are still if you refuse to let your own son come into your house."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='663'>"Oh, that I will tell you," answered the youth. "You said that I might take to anything I liked, so I apprenticed myself to some thieves and robbers, and now I have served my time and have become Master Thief."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='726'>So the Master Thief immediately got hold of an old worn-out mare, and set himself to work to make a collar for it of green withies and branches of broom; bought a shabby old cart and a great cask, and then he told a poor old beggar woman that he would give her ten dollars if she would get into the cask and keep her mouth wide-open beneath the tap-hole, into which he was going to stick his finger. No harm should happen to her, he said; she should only be driven about a little, and if he took his finger out more than once, she should have ten dollars more. Then he dressed himself in rags, dyed himself with soot, and put on a wig and a great beard of goat"s hair, so that it was impossible to recognise him, and went to the parade ground, where the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wig;rag;parade;time;hair;s;soot;ground;goat;beard' adjectives='impossible;great;long' verbs='be;have;ride;go;recognise;put;dye;dress' valence='5.45' arousal='3.99' dominance='5.29541666667'>Governor</entity> had already been riding about a long time.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1051'>On and on and on she went across bare sandy deserts, where the roads were so heavy that for every two steps that she took forwards she fell back one; but she struggled on till she had passed these dreary plains; next she crossed high rocky mountains, jumping from crag to crag and from peak to peak. Sometimes she would rest for a little on a mountain, and then start afresh always farther and farther on. She had to cross swamps and to scale mountain peaks covered with flints, so that her feet and knees and elbows were all torn and bleeding, and sometimes she came to a precipice across which she could not jump, and she had to crawl round on hands and knees, helping herself along with her staff. At length, wearied to death, she reached the palace in which the Sun lived. She knocked and begged for admission. The mother of the Sun opened the door, and was astonished at beholding a mortal from the distant earthly shores, and wept with pity when she heard of all she had suffered. Then, having promised to ask her son about the Princess"s husband, she hid her in the cellar, so that the Sun might notice nothing on his return home, for he was always in a bad temper when he came in at night. The next day the Princess feared that things would not go well with her, for the Sun had noticed that some one from the other world had been in the palace. But his mother had soothed him with soft words, assuring him that this was not so. So the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart' adjectives='' verbs='ask;be;see;take;treat' valence='6.07714285714' arousal='4.44285714286' dominance='5.58857142857'>Princess</entity> took heart when she saw how kindly she was treated, and asked:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1055'>Before the Princess left the mother of the Sun gave her a roast chicken to eat, and advised her to take great care of the bones, which she did, wrapping them up in a bundle. She then threw away her second pair of shoes, which were quite worn out, and with her child on her arm and her staff in her hand, she set forth on her way to the Wind.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1056'>In these wanderings she met with even greater difficulties than before, for she came upon one mountain of flints after another, out of which tongues of fire would flame up; she passed through woods which had never been trodden by human foot, and had to cross fields of ice and avalanches of snow. The poor woman nearly died of these hardships, but she kept a brave heart, and at length she reached an enormous cave in the side of a mountain. This was where the Wind lived. There was a little door in the railing in front of the cave, and here the Princess knocked and begged for admission. The mother of the Wind had pity on her and took her in, that she might rest a little. Here too she was hidden away, so that the Wind might not notice her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1057'>The next morning the mother of the Wind told her that her husband was living in a thick wood, so thick that no axe had been able to cut a way through it; here he had built himself a sort of house by placing trunks of trees together and fastening them with withes and here he lived alone, shunning human kind.</paragraph>

On and on she walked until her last pair of shoes fell in pieces. So she threw them away and went on with bare feet, not heeding the bogs nor the thorns that wounded her, nor the stones that bruised her. At last she reached a beautiful green meadow on the edge of a wood. Her heart was cheered by the sight of the flowers and the soft cool grass, and she sat down and rested for a little. But hearing the birds chirping to their mates among the trees made her think with longing of her husband, and she wept bitterly, and taking her child in her arms, and her bundle of chicken bones on her shoulder, she entered <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shoulder;longing;tree;bundle;think;arm;mate;bone;child;chicken;bird;husband' adjectives='' verbs='make;chirp;hear;take;enter;weep' valence='6.00777777778' arousal='3.97222222222' dominance='5.75277777778'>the wood</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1060'>For three days and three nights she struggled through it, but could find nothing. She was quite worn out with weariness and hunger, and even her staff was no further help to her, for in her many wanderings it had become quite blunted. She almost gave up in despair, but made one last great effort, and suddenly in a thicket she came upon the sort of house that the mother of the Wind had described. It had no windows, and the door was up in the roof. Round the house she went, in search of steps, but could find none. What was she to do? How was she to get in? She thought and thought, and tried in vain to climb up to the door. Then suddenly she be-thought her of the chicken bones that she had dragged all that weary way, and she said to herself: "They would not all have told me to take such good care of these bones if they had not had some good reason for doing so. Perhaps now, in my hour of need, they may be of use to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1061'>So she took the bones out of her bundle, and having thought for a moment, she placed the two ends together. To her surprise they stuck tight; then she added the other bones, till she had two long poles the height of the house; these she placed against the wall, at a distance of a yard from one another. Across them she placed the other bones, piece by piece, like the steps of a ladder. As soon as one step was finished she stood upon it and made the next one, and then the next, till she was close to the door. But just as she got near the top she noticed that there were no bones left for the last rung of the ladder. What was she to do? Without that last step the whole ladder was useless. She must have lost one of the bones. Then suddenly an idea came to her. Taking a knife she chopped off her little finger, and placing it on the last step, it stuck as the bones had done. The ladder was complete, and with her child on her arm she entered the door of the house. Here she found everything in perfect order. Having taken some food, she laid the child down to sleep in a trough that was on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='food;trough;child' adjectives='' verbs='be;sit;rest;sleep;take;have;lay' valence='6.0825' arousal='3.86916666667' dominance='5.56666666667'>the floor</entity>, and sat down herself to rest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1062'>When her husband, the Pig, came back to his house, he was startled by what he saw. At first he could not believe his eyes, and stared at the ladder of bones, and at the little finger on the top of it. He felt that some fresh magic must be at work, and in his terror he almost turned away from the house; but then a better idea came to him, and he changed himself into a dove, so that no witchcraft could have power over him, and flew into the room without touching the ladder. Here he found a woman rocking a child. At the sight of her, looking so changed by all that she had suffered for his sake, his heart was moved by such love and longing and by so great a pity that he suddenly became a man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1063'>The Princess stood up when she saw him, and her heart beat with fear, for she did not know him. But when he had told her who he was, in her great joy she forgot all her sufferings, and they seemed as nothing to her. He was a very handsome man, as straight as a fir tree. They sat down together and she told him all her adventures, and he wept with pity at the tale. And then he told her his own history.</paragraph>

But he soon saw that he couldn"t catch it on foot, so he hastened to the stable, laid his hands on the best horse there, and set off in pursuit. Presently he came up with the beast, and they began a fight. They fought and fought; the Prince gave the beast three wounds. At last they were both utterly exhausted, so they lay down to take a short rest. But the moment the Prince closed his eyes, up jumped the beast and took to flight.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1085'>"Thou who art in my house, name thyself! If thou art an old man, thou shalt be my father; if a middle-aged man, my brother; but if a young man, thou shalt be my husband dear. And if thou art a woman, and an old one, thou shalt be my grandmother; if middle-aged, my mother; and if a girl, thou shalt be my own sister."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1086'>Thereupon he came forth. And when she saw him she was delighted with him, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1087'>"Wherefore, O Prince Ivan--my husband dear shalt thou be!--wherefore hast thou come hither?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1088'>Then he told her all that had happened, and she said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1089'>"That beast which thou wishest to overcome is my brother. He is staying just now with my second sister, who lives not far from here in a silver palace. I bound up three of the wounds which thou didst give him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1090'>Well, after this they drank, and enjoyed themselves, and held sweet converse together, and then the Prince took leave of her, and went on to the second sister, the one who lived in the silver palace, and with her also he stayed awhile. She told him that her brother Norka was then at her youngest sister"s. So he went on to the youngest sister, who lived in a golden palace. She told him that her brother was at that time asleep on the blue sea, and she gave him a sword of steel and a draught of the Water of Strength, and she told him to cut off her brother"s head at a single stroke. And when he had heard these things, he went his way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1091'>And when the Prince came to the blue sea, he looked--there slept the Norka on a stone in the middle of the sea; and when it snored, the water was agitated for seven miles around. The Prince crossed himself, went up to it, and smote it on the head with his sword. The head jumped off, saying the while, "Well, I"m done for now!" and rolled far away into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='roll' valence='6.14' arousal='3.35' dominance='5.165'>the sea</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1092'>After killing the beast, the Prince went back again, picking up all the three sisters by the way, with the intention of taking them out into the upper world: for they all loved him and would not be separated from him. Each of them turned her palace into an egg--for they were all enchantresses--and they taught him how to turn the eggs into palaces, and back again, and they handed over the eggs to him. And then they all went to the place from which they had to be hoisted into the upper world. And when they came to where the rope was, the Prince took hold of it and made the maidens fast to it. Then he jerked away at the rope and his brothers began to haul it up. And when they had hauled it up, and had set eyes on the wondrous maidens, they went aside and said: "Let"s lower the rope, pull our brother part of the way up, and then cut the rope. Perhaps he"ll be killed; but then if he isn"t, he"ll never give us these beauties as wives."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1093'>So when they had agreed on this, they lowered the rope. But their brother was no fool; he guessed what they were at, so he fastened the rope to a stone, and then gave it a pull. His brothers hoisted the stone to a great height, and then cut the rope. Down fell the stone and broke in pieces; the Prince poured forth tears and went away. Well, he walked and walked. Presently a storm arose; the lightning flashed, the thunder roared, the rain fell in torrents. He went up to a tree in order to take shelter under it, and on that tree he saw some young birds which were being thoroughly drenched. So he took off his coat and covered them over with it, and he himself sat down under the tree. Presently there came flying a bird--such a big one that the light was blotted out by it. It had been dark there before, but now it became darker still. Now this was the mother of those small birds which the Prince had covered up. And when the bird had come flying up, she perceived that her little ones were covered over, and she said, "Who has wrapped up my nestlings?" and presently, seeing the Prince, she added: "Didst thou do that? Thanks! In return, ask of me anything thou desirest. I will do anything for thee."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1094'>"Then carry me into the other world," he replied.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1095'>"Make me a large vessel with a partition in the middle," she said; "catch all sorts of game, and put them into one half of it, and into the other half pour water; so that there may be meat and drink for me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1096'>All this the Prince did. Then the bird--having taken the vessel on her back, with the Prince sitting in the middle of it--began to fly. And after flying some distance she brought him to his journey"s end, took leave of him, and flew away back. But he went to the house of a certain tailor, and engaged himself as his servant. So much the worse for wear was he, so thoroughly had he altered in appearance, that nobody would have suspected him of being a <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='nobody;appearance;wear' adjectives='worse' verbs='be;suspect;alter;have' valence='5.44454545455' arousal='4.04545454545' dominance='5.28909090909'>Prince</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1103'>Midnight sounded.

Then she put on a gorgeous robe of lilac satin lined with blue, and a yellow petticoat trimmed with violet ribbons, and because she had heard that queens always rode into their new dominions, she ordered a horse to be made ready for her to ride.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1498'>While Graciosa was waiting until the King should be ready to set out, she went down all alone through the garden into a little wood, where she sat down upon a mossy bank and began to think.

He was dressed in green, and the cap which he held in his hand was adorned with white plumes.

Indeed, she was so pretty that it was a real pleasure to look at her. When the horse which the Duchess was to ride appeared beside Graciosa"s, it looked no better than an old cart horse, and as to their trappings, there was simply no comparison between them, as the Princess"s saddle and bridle were one glittering mass of diamonds. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;courtier;page;rest' adjectives='distinguished-looking;many;charming;other;green;handsome' verbs='do;notice;be;admire;take;have;put;think' valence='6.10894736842' arousal='3.94684210526' dominance='5.80842105263'>The King</entity> had so many other things to think of that he did not notice this, but all his courtiers were entirely taken up with admiring the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thing;courtier;page;rest' adjectives='distinguished-looking;many;charming;other;green;handsome' verbs='do;notice;be;admire;take;have;put;think' valence='6.10894736842' arousal='3.94684210526' dominance='5.80842105263'>Princess</entity> and her charming Page in green, who was more handsome and distinguished-looking than all the rest of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='thing;courtier;page;rest' adjectives='distinguished-looking;many;charming;other;green;handsome' verbs='do;notice;be;admire;take;have;put;think' valence='6.10894736842' arousal='3.94684210526' dominance='5.80842105263'>the court</entity> put together.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1513'>At first the Duchess clung to the saddle, but she was very soon thrown off and fell in a heap among the stones and thorns, and there they found her, shaken to a jelly, and collected what was left of her as if she had been a broken glass.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1515'>Thereupon she sent for Graciosa, who turned pale and trembled at the summons, for she guessed that it promised nothing agreeable for her. She looked all about for Percinet, but he was nowhere to be seen; so she had no choice but to go to the Duchess Grumbly"s room. She had hardly got inside the door when she was seized by four waiting women, who looked so tall and strong and cruel that the Princess shuddered at the sight of them, and still more when she saw them arming themselves with great bundles of rods, and heard the Duchess call out to them from her bed to beat the Princess without mercy. Poor Graciosa wished miserably that Percinet could only know what was happening and come to rescue her. But no sooner did they begin to beat her than she found, to her great relief, that the rods had changed to bundles of peacock"s feathers, and though the Duchess"s women went on till they were so tired that they could no longer raise their arms from their sides, yet she was not hurt in the least. However, the Duchess thought she must be black and blue after such a beating; so Graciosa, when she was released, pretended to feel very bad, and went away into her own room, where she told her nurse all that had happened, and then the nurse left her, and when the Princess turned round there stood Percinet beside her.

This forest was so gloomy, and so full of lions, tigers, bears and wolves, that nobody dared pass through it even by daylight, and here they set down the unhappy Princess in the middle of the black night, and left her in spite of all her tears and entreaties. The Princess stood quite still at first from sheer bewilderment, but when the last sound of the retreating carriages died away in the distance she began to run aimlessly hither and thither, sometimes knocking herself against a tree, sometimes tripping over a stone, fearing every minute that she would be eaten up by the lions. Presently she was too tired to advance another step, so she threw herself down upon the ground and cried miserably:</paragraph>

When she had been dressed by the four-and-twenty maidens in a charming robe which the Queen had sent for her, and in which she looked prettier than ever, Prince Percinet came to see her, and was bitterly disappointed when she told him what she had been thinking. He begged her to consider again how unhappy the wicked Queen would make her, and how, if she would but marry him, all the fairy palace would be hers, and his one thought would be to please her. But, in spite of everything he could say, the Princess was quite determined to go back, though he at last persuaded her to stay eight days, which were so full of pleasure and amusement that they passed like a few hours. On the last day, Graciosa, who had often felt anxious to know what was going on in her father"s palace, said to Percinet that she was sure that he could find out for her, if he would, what reason the Queen had given her father for her sudden disappearance.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='1544'>When they got near the palace the Prince made the sledge and themselves invisible, so the Princess got in unobserved, and ran up to the great hall where the King was sitting all by himself. At first he was very much startled by Graciosa"s sudden appearance, but she told him how the Queen had left her out in the forest, and how she had caused a log of wood to be buried. The King, who did not know what to think, sent quickly and had it dug up, and sure enough it was as the Princess had said. Then he caressed Graciosa, and made her sit down to supper with him, and they were as happy as possible. But someone had by this time told the wicked Queen that Graciosa had come back, and was at supper with the King, and in she flew in a terrible fury. The poor old King quite trembled before her, and when she declared that Graciosa was not the Princess at all, but a wicked impostor, and that if the King did not give her up at once she would go back to her own castle and never see him again, he had not a word to say, and really seemed to believe that it was not Graciosa after all. So the Queen in great triumph sent for her waiting women, who dragged the unhappy Princess away and shut her up in a garret; they took away all her jewels and her pretty dress, and gave her a rough cotton frock, wooden shoes, and a little cloth cap. There was some straw in a corner, which was all she had for a bed, and they gave her a very little bit of black bread to eat.

These feathers were all mixed up in such confusion that the birds themselves could not have chosen out their own. "Here," said the Fairy, "is a little task which it will take all your prisoner"s skill and patience to accomplish. Tell her to pick out and lay in a separate heap the feathers of each bird.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1657'>And she began to look round <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fur;coat;hand;hold;round;husband' adjectives='firm;fast' verbs='begin;look;jump;say;take;hold;reproach' valence='5.86466666667' arousal='3.98133333333' dominance='5.796'>the room</entity> for her fur coat, but her husband jumped up, and taking firm hold of her by the hand, held her fast, and reproached her, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1658'>"Don"t you remember what I told you? Stay where you are unless you wish to die."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1659'>"But don"t you hear that voice calling me?" she answered. "I am merely going to see why I am wanted. I shall come back directly."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1660'>So she fought and struggled to get away from her husband, and to go where the voice summoned. But he would not let her go, and had all the doors of the house shut and bolted. When she saw that he had done this, she said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1661'>"Very well, dear husband, I shall do what you wish, and remain where I am."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1662'>So her husband believed that it was all right, and that she had thought better of it, and had got over her mad impulse to obey the voice. But a few minutes later she made a sudden dash for one of the doors, opened it and darted out, followed by her husband. He caught her by the fur coat, and begged and implored her not to go, for if she did she would certainly never return. She said nothing, but let her arms fall backwards, and suddenly bending herself forward, she slipped out of the coat, leaving it in her husband"s hands. He, poor man, seemed turned to stone as he gazed after her hurrying away from him, and calling at the top of her voice, as she ran:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1663'>"I am coming! I am coming!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1664'>When she was quite out of sight her husband recovered his wits and went back into his house, murmuring:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1665'>"If she is so foolish as to wish to die, I can"t help it. I warned and implored her to pay no heed to that voice, however loudly it might call."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1666'>Well, days and weeks and months and years passed, and nothing happened to disturb the peace of the household. But one day the man was at the barber"s as usual, being shaved. <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='voice;chin;soap;lather;people' adjectives='full;loud' verbs='call;be;cover;have;start' valence='5.8825' arousal='3.825625' dominance='5.578125'>The shop</entity> was full of people, and his chin had just been covered with a lather of soap, when, suddenly starting up from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='voice;chin;soap;lather;people' adjectives='full;loud' verbs='call;be;cover;have;start' valence='5.8825' arousal='3.825625' dominance='5.578125'>the chair</entity>, he called out in a loud voice:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1669'>"I tell you, once and for all, I do not mean to come, so go away."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1670'>And a few minutes later he called out again:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1672'>And he got so angry that you might have thought that some one was actually standing at the door, tormenting him. At last he jumped up, and caught the razor out of the barber"s hand, exclaiming:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1673'>"Give me that razor, and I"ll teach him to let people alone for the future."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1674'>And he rushed out of the house as if he were running after some one, whom no one else saw. The barber, determined not to lose his razor, pursued the man, and they both continued running at full speed till they had got well out of the town, when all of a sudden the man fell head foremost down a precipice, and never was seen again. So he too, like the others, had been forced against his will to follow the voice that called him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1675'>The barber, who went home whistling and congratulating himself on the escape he had made, described what had happened, and it was noised abroad in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='people;congratulating;barber;escape;call;home;voice;pit' adjectives='noised' verbs='be;return;obey;make;describe;whistle;hear;know;have;fall;go;happen' valence='5.83103448276' arousal='3.66379310345' dominance='5.61137931034'>the country</entity> that the people who had gone away, and had never returned, had all fallen into that pit; for till then they had never known what had happened to those who had heard the voice and obeyed its call.</paragraph>

And from that time the people of the country began to die like ordinary mortals all the world over.(13)</paragraph>

His Queen had left one daughter behind her, and she was so wise and so pretty that it was impossible for any one to be wiser or prettier. For a long time the King went sorrowing for his wife, for he had loved her exceedingly; but at last he grew tired of living alone, and married a Queen who was a widow, and she also had a daughter, who was just as ill-favoured and wicked as the other was good and beautiful. The stepmother and her daughter were envious of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='harm;love;daughter;s;home;stepmother' adjectives='envious;great' verbs='be;dare;do' valence='5.83555555556' arousal='4.46444444444' dominance='5.37333333333'>the King</entity>"s daughter because she was so pretty, but so long as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='harm;love;daughter;s;home;stepmother' adjectives='envious;great' verbs='be;dare;do' valence='5.83555555556' arousal='4.46444444444' dominance='5.37333333333'>the King</entity> was at home they dared do her no harm, because his love for her was so great.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1715'>Then there came a time when he made war on another King and went away to fight, and then the new Queen thought that she could do what she liked; so she both hungered and beat the King"s daughter and chased her about into every corner. At last she thought that everything was too good for her, and set her to work to look after the cattle. So she went about with the cattle, and herded them in the woods and in the fields. Of food she got little or none, and grew pale and thin, and was nearly always weeping and sad. Among the herd there was a great blue bull, which always kept itself very smart and sleek, and often came to the King"s daughter and let her stroke him. So one day, when she was again sitting crying and sorrowing, the Bull came up to her and asked why she was always so full of care? She made no answer, but continued to weep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1716'>"Well," said the Bull, "I know what it is, though you will not tell me; you are weeping because the Queen is unkind to you, and because she wants to starve you to death.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1717'>So she did this, and took the cloth and spread it out upon the grass, and then it was covered with the daintiest dishes that any one could desire, and there was wine, and mead, and cake. And now she became brisk and well again, and grew so rosy, and plump, and fair that the Queen and her scraggy daughter turned blue and white with vexation at it. The Queen could not imagine how her step-daughter could look so well on such bad food, so she ordered one of her handmaidens to follow her into the wood and watch her, and see how it was, for she thought that some of the servants must be giving her food. So the maid followed her into the wood and watched, and saw how the step-daughter took the cloth out of the Blue Bull"s ear, and spread it out, and how the cloth was then covered with the most delicate dishes, which the step-daughter ate and regaled herself with.

Both the King"s daughter and the people in the palace asked the doctor if there were no other means of saving her, and begged for the Bull"s life, for they were all fond of him, and they all declared that there was no such Bull in the whole country; but it was all in vain, he was to be killed, and should be killed, and nothing else would serve. When the King"s daughter heard it she was full of sorrow, and went down to the byre to the Bull.

So they had to wait a day, and the Bull told the King"s daughter to take the horn of ointment which hung at the Troll"s belt, and rub him with it; then he was himself again, and the next day they set off once more. And now they journeyed on for many, many days, and then after a long, long time they came to a silver wood.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1735'>Before the Bull went into the wood, he said to the King"s daughter: "When we enter into this wood you must, for Heaven"s sake, be very careful not to touch anything at all, and not to pluck off even so much as one leaf, or else all will be over both with you and with me.

But the Bull was then so weak and worn out that it was only with pain and effort that he could move, and so covered with wounds that the blood streamed from him. So he told the King"s daughter to take the horn of ointment that was hanging at the Troll"s belt, and anoint him with it.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1743'>At last they set forth on their way again, but the Bull was still weak, and at first could not go quickly. The King"s daughter wished to spare him, and said that she was so young and light of foot that she would willingly walk, but he would not give her leave to do that, and she was forced to seat herself on his back again. So they travelled for a long time, and through many lands, and the King"s daughter did not at all know where he was taking her, but after a long, long time they came to a gold wood. It was so golden that the gold dripped off it, and the trees, and the branches, and the flowers, and the leaves were all of pure gold. Here all happened just as it had happened in the copper wood and silver wood. The Bull told the King"s daughter that on no account was she to touch it, for there was a Troll with nine heads who was the owner, and that he was much larger and stronger than both the others put together, and that he did not believe that he could overcome him. So she said that she would take great care not to touch anything, and he should see that she did. But when they got into the wood it was still thicker than the silver wood, and the farther they got into it the worse it grew. The wood became thicker and thicker, and closer and closer, and at last she thought there was no way whatsoever by which they could get forward; she was so terrified lest she should break anything off, that she sat and twisted, and turned herself on this side and on that, to get out of the way of the branches, and pushed them away from her with her hands, but every moment they struck against her eyes, so that she could not see what she was clutching at, and before she knew what she was doing she had a golden apple in her hands. She was now in such terror that she began to cry, and wanted to throw it away, but the Bull said that she was to keep it, and take the greatest care of it, and comforted her as well as he could, but he believed that it would be a hard struggle, and he doubted whether it would go well with him.</paragraph>

The Bull gored the Troll"s eyes out and ran his horns right through him, but the Troll fought as well as he did, and when the Bull had gored one head to death the other heads breathed life into it again, so it was a whole week before the Bull was able to kill him. But then he himself was so worn out and weak that he could not move at all. His body was all one wound, and he could not even so much as tell the King"s daughter to take the horn of ointment out of the Troll"s belt and rub him with it.

He found that the pictures seemed to be scenes from the life of a man who appeared in every window, and the Prince, fancying that he saw in this man some resemblance to himself, began to be deeply interested. In the first window there was a picture of him in one of the turrets of the tower, farther on he was seeking something in a chink in the wall, in the next picture he was opening an old cabinet with a golden key, and so it went on through numbers of scenes, and presently the Prince noticed that another figure occupied the most important place in each scene, and this time it was a tall handsome young man: poor Prince Curlicue found it a pleasure to look at him, he was so straight and strong. By this time it had grown dark, and the Prince had to go back to his own room, and to amuse himself he took up a quaint old book and began to look at the pictures. But his surprise was great to find that they represented the same scenes as the windows of the gallery, and what was more, that they seemed to be alive. In looking at pictures of musicians he saw their hands move and heard sweet sounds; there was a picture of a ball, and the Prince could watch the little dancing people come and go. He turned a page, and there was an excellent smell of a savoury dinner, and one of the figures who sat at the feast looked at him and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2054'>"We drink your health, Curlicue. Try to give us our <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='worse' verbs='try;do;be;reward;give' valence='6.19666666667' arousal='3.94777777778' dominance='6.06666666667'>Queen</entity> again, for if you do you will be rewarded; if not, it will be the worse for you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2055'>At these words the Prince, who had been growing more and more astonished, was fairly terrified, and dropping the book with a crash he sank back insensible. The noise he made brought his guards to his aid, and as soon as he revived they asked him what was the matter. He answered that he was so faint and giddy with hunger that he had imagined he saw and heard all sorts of strange things. Thereupon, in spite of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='picture;none;spite;guard;s;book;supper;order;thereupon' adjectives='wonderful;excellent' verbs='be;give;dream;see;convince;have;open;eat' valence='6.357' arousal='4.1295' dominance='5.916'>the King</entity>"s orders, the guards gave him an excellent supper, and when he had eaten it he again opened his book, but could see none of the wonderful pictures, which convinced him that he must have been dreaming before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2056'>However, when he went into he gallery next day and looked at the painted windows again, he found that they moved, and the figures came and went as if they had been alive, and after watching the one who was like himself find the key in the crack of the turret wall and open the old cabinet, he determined to go and examine the place himself, and try to find out what the mystery was. So he went up into the turret and began to search about and tap upon the walls, and all at once he came upon a place that sounded hollow. Taking a hammer he broke away a bit of the stone, and found behind it a little golden key. The next thing to do was to find the cabinet, and the Prince soon came to it, hidden away in a dark corner, though indeed it was so old and battered-looking that he would never have noticed it of his own accord. At first he could not see any keyhole, but after a careful search he found one hidden in the carving, and the golden key just fitted it; so the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='door;turn;search;keyhole;key' adjectives='golden;careful;vigorous;open' verbs='fly;hide;fit;give;see;carve;find' valence='5.98523809524' arousal='4.15476190476' dominance='5.73047619048'>Prince</entity> gave it a vigorous turn and the doors flew open.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2057'>Ugly and old as the cabinet was outside, nothing could have been more rich and beautiful than what met the Prince"s astonished eyes. Every drawer was made of crystal, of amber, or of some precious stone, and was quite full of every kind of treasure. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='drawer;key' adjectives='last;tiny;emerald' verbs='delight;be;open;come;contain' valence='5.89307692308' arousal='3.98076923077' dominance='5.76615384615'>Prince Curlicue</entity> was delighted; he opened one after another, until at last he came to one tiny drawer which contained only an emerald key.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2058'>"I believe that this must open that little golden door in the middle," said the Prince to himself. And he fitted in the little key and turned it. The tiny door swung back, and a soft crimson light gleamed over the whole cabinet. The Prince found that it proceeded from an immense glowing carbuncle, made into a box, which lay before him. He lost no time in opening it, but what was his horror when he found that it contained a man"s hand, which was holding a portrait. His first thought was to put back the terrible box and fly from the turret; but a voice in his ear said, "This hand belonged to one whom you can help and restore. Look at this beautiful portrait, the original of which was the cause of all my misfortunes, and if you wish to help me, go without a moment"s delay to the great gallery, notice where the sun"s rays fall most brightly, and if you seek there you will find my treasure."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='2059'>The voice ceased, and though the Prince in his bewilderment asked various questions, he received no answer. So he put back the box and locked <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='box;key;crack' adjectives='' verbs='put;lock;hasten;have;replace' valence='5.16833333333' arousal='3.5025' dominance='5.37083333333'>the cabinet</entity> up again, and, having replaced the key in the crack in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='box;key;crack' adjectives='' verbs='put;lock;hasten;have;replace' valence='5.16833333333' arousal='3.5025' dominance='5.37083333333'>the wall</entity>, hastened down to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='box;key;crack' adjectives='' verbs='put;lock;hasten;have;replace' valence='5.16833333333' arousal='3.5025' dominance='5.37083333333'>the gallery</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2060'>When he entered it all the windows shook and clattered in the strangest way, but the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sun;window;place;way;portrait;man' adjectives='strangest;young;handsome' verbs='shine;do;look;be;enter;heed;shake;clatter;seem' valence='5.8235' arousal='4.112' dominance='5.6'>Prince</entity> did not heed them; he was looking so carefully for the place where the sun shone most brightly, and it seemed to him that it was upon the portrait of a most splendidly handsome young man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2061'>He went up and examined it, and found that it rested against the ebony and gold panelling, just like any of the other pictures in the gallery. He was puzzled, not knowing what to do next, until it occurred to him to see if the windows would help him, and, looking at the nearest, he saw a picture of himself lifting the picture from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='picture;window' adjectives='nearest;next' verbs='be;help;do;puzzle;see;lift;know;occur;look' valence='5.86375' arousal='3.808125' dominance='5.623125'>the wall</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2062'>The Prince took the hint, and lifting aside the picture without difficulty, found himself in a marble hall adorned with statues; from this he passed on through numbers of splendid rooms, until at last he reached one all hung with blue gauze. The walls were of turquoises, and upon a low couch lay a lovely lady, who seemed to be asleep. Her hair, black as ebony, was spread across the pillows, making her face look ivory white, and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ivory;look;sigh;face;hair;murmur;pillow;ebony' adjectives='unquiet;white;black' verbs='be;notice;advance;make;spread;wake;hear;fear' valence='5.7495' arousal='3.8065' dominance='5.5545'>Prince</entity> noticed that she was unquiet; and when he softly advanced, fearing to wake her, he could hear her sigh, and murmur to herself:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2066'>This he presented to the Prince, who guessed by this time that he was in some way to break the enchantment that surrounded the sleeping lady. Taking the branch he touched her lightly with it, saying:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2085'>At this juncture the guards, who were in great fear that they would be found out, sent to tell the King that his son was dead, which annoyed him very much. He at once made up his mind that it was entirely the Princess"s fault, and gave orders that she should be imprisoned in the tower in Prince Curlicue"s place. The Princess Cabbage-Stalk was immensely astonished at this unjust proceeding, and sent many messages of remonstrance to King Grumpy, but he was in such a temper that no one dared to deliver them, or to send the letters which the Princess wrote to her father. However, as she did not know this, she lived in hope of soon going back to her own country, and tried to amuse herself as well as she could until the time should come. Every day she walked up and down the long gallery, until she too was attracted and fascinated by the ever-changing pictures in the windows, and recognised herself in one of the figures. "They seem to have taken a great delight in painting me since I came to this country," she said to herself. "One would think that I and my crutch were put in on purpose to make that slim, charming young shepherdess in the next picture look prettier by contrast. Ah! how nice it would be to be as pretty as that." And then she looked at herself in a mirror, and turned away quickly with tears in her eyes from the doleful sight. All at once she became aware that she was not alone, for behind her stood a tiny old woman in a cap, who was as ugly again as herself and quite as lame.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2086'>"Princess," she said, "your regrets are so piteous that I have come to offer you the choice of goodness or beauty. If you wish to be pretty you shall have your way, but you will also be vain, capricious, and frivolous. If you remain as you are now, you shall be wise and amiable and modest."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2087'>"Alas I madam," cried the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='beautiful;impossible;wise' verbs='madam;cry;be' valence='5.76888888889' arousal='4.49666666667' dominance='5.05555555556'>Princess</entity>, "is it impossible to be at once wise and beautiful?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2088'>"No, child," answered the old woman, "only to you it is decreed that you must choose between the two. See, I have brought with me my white and yellow muff.

Breathe upon the white side and your looks will not alter, but you will grow better and happier day by day. Now you may choose."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2089'>"Ah well," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='everything;s;t' adjectives='better;good' verbs='be;say;suppose;have' valence='6.1625' arousal='4.175' dominance='5.755'>Princess</entity>, "I suppose one can"t have everything, and it"s certainly better to be good than pretty."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2090'>And so she breathed upon the white side of the muff and thanked the old fairy, who immediately disappeared.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2091'>"If I could but get up into the turret," she thought, "to see if any one is coming." But to climb up there seemed impossible. Nevertheless she presently hit upon a plan. The great clock was in the turret, as she knew, though the weights hung down into the gallery. Taking one of them off the rope, she tied herself on in its place, and when the clock was wound, up she went triumphantly into the turret. She looked out over the country the first thing, but seeing nothing she sat down to rest a little, and accidentally leant back against the wall which Curlicue, or rather Prince Peerless, had so hastily mended. Out fell the broken stone, and with it the golden key. The clatter it made upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='clatter;s;attention' adjectives='' verbs='make;attract' valence='5.85428571429' arousal='4.55142857143' dominance='5.74428571429'>the floor</entity> attracted the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='clatter;s;attention' adjectives='' verbs='make;attract' valence='5.85428571429' arousal='4.55142857143' dominance='5.74428571429'>Princess Cabbage-Stalk</entity>"s attention.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2092'>She picked it up, and after a moment"s consideration decided that it must belong to the curious old cabinet in the corner, which had no visible keyhole. And then it was not long before she had it open, and was admiring the treasures it contained as much as Prince Peerless had done before her, and at last she came to the carbuncle box. No sooner had she opened it than with a shudder of horror she tried to throw it down, but found that some mysterious power compelled her to hold it against her will. And at this moment a voice in her ear said softly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2093'>"Take courage, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='courage;adventure;happiness' adjectives='' verbs='depend;take' valence='6.81285714286' arousal='5.36857142857' dominance='6.14142857143'>Princess</entity>; upon this adventure your future happiness depends."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2096'>Terrified as the Princess was, she did not hesitate to obey, and hastened to put back all the other precious things precisely as she had found them.

For three days nothing happened, but at last in the night the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eagle;moonlight;window;something;nothing;curtain;flutter' adjectives='last' verbs='be;happen;hear;draw;see' valence='5.98125' arousal='3.79875' dominance='5.5575'>Princess</entity> heard something flutter against her window, and drawing back her curtains she saw in the moonlight that it was an Eagle.</paragraph>

However, he was more powerful than I, and succeeded, when for a moment I was off my guard, in changing me into an Eagle, while my Queen was left in an enchanted sleep. I knew that after two hundred years a Prince would recall her to the light of day, and a Princess, in restoring to me the hand which my enemy had cut off, would give me back my natural form. The Fairy who watches over your destiny told me this, and it was she who guided you to the cabinet in the turret, where she had placed my hand. It is she also who permits me to show my gratitude to you by granting whatever favour you may ask of me. Tell me, Princess, what is it that you wish for most? Shall I make you as beautiful as you deserve to be?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2099'>"Ah, if you only would!" cried the Princess, and at the same moment she heard a crick-cracking in all her bones. She grew tall and straight and pretty, with eyes like shining stars, and a skin as white as milk.</paragraph>

Now one day, when the King was out and nobody else near, the bad woman took the Queen by her head, and the daughter took her by her heels, and they dragged her from her bed, and flung her out of the window into the stream which flowed beneath it.

When he had walked a long way, he came to a King"s palace. There he asked for a place and got it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2232'>Now the daughter of the King of that country had been carried off into the mountains by a Troll, and the King had no other children, and for this cause both he and all his people were full of sorrow and affliction, and the King had promised the Princess and half his kingdom to anyone who could set her free; but there was no one who could do it, though a great number had tried. So when the youth had been there for the space of a year or so, he wanted to go home again to pay his parents a visit; but when he got there his father and mother were dead, and his brothers had divided everything that their parents possessed between themselves, so that there was nothing at all left for him.</paragraph>

This time the dappled horse was not unwilling to go away with the youth, so he mounted it, and when he came riding home to his brothers they all smote their hands together and crossed themselves, for never in their lives had they either seen or heard tell of such a horse as that.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2256'>The King immediately summoned the lad into his presence, and said that he had been informed that he had said that it was in his power to rescue the Princess, so he was now to do it. If he succeeded in this, he no doubt knew that the King had promised his daughter and half the kingdom to anyone who set her free, which promise should be faithfully and honourably kept, but if he failed he should be put to death.

	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='2258'>So the youth did this, and no one said him nay.

But when he came to the mountain into which the Princess had been carried, the difficulty was to ascend the precipitous wall of rock by which he was to get on to the mountain beyond, for the rock stood right up on end, as steep as a house side and as smooth as a sheet of glass. The first time the youth rode at it he got a little way up the precipice, but then both Dapplegrim"s fore legs slipped, and down came horse and rider with a sound like thunder among the mountains. The next time that he rode at it he got a little farther up, but then one of Dapplegrim"s fore legs slipped, and down they went with the sound of a landslip. But the third time Dapplegrim said: "Now we must show what we can do," and went at it once more till the stones sprang up sky high, and thus they got up.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='2264'>The lad asked for these things and obtained them instantly, for the King thought that for very shame he could not refuse to give them, and so Dapplegrim got new shoes, and they were good ones.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2265'>When the youth came down again to the King"s palace he asked the King if the Princess should not at last be his, for now no one could say that the sun was not shining into the palace. But the other people in the palace had again stirred up the King, and he answered that the youth should have her, and that he had never intended that he should not; but first of all he must get her quite as good a horse to ride to the wedding on as that which he had himself. The youth said that the King had never told him he was to do that, and it seemed to him that he had now really earned the Princess; but the King stuck to what he had said, and if the youth were unable to do it he was to lose his life, the King said. The youth went down to the stable again, and very sad and sorrowful he was, as anyone may well imagine. Then he told Dapplegrim that the King had now required that he should get the Princess as good a bridal horse as that which the bridegroom had, or he should lose his life.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2269'>The youth did it.

"Be quick, and fling over me the ox-hides that have the spikes in them, throw the twelve tons of tar over the field, and climb up into that great spruce fir tree.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2282'>Just as the youth had flung all the hides with the spikes over Dapplegrim, and the tar over the field, and had got safely up into the spruce fir, a horse came with flame spouting from his nostrils, and the tar caught fire in a moment; and Dapplegrim and the horse began to fight until the stones leapt up to the sky. They bit, and they fought with their fore legs and their hind legs, and sometimes the youth looked at them. And sometimes he looked at the tar, but at last the flames began to rise, for wheresoever the strange horse bit or wheresoever he kicked he hit upon the spikes in the hides, and at length he had to yield.

The desire grew day by day, and just because she knew she couldn"t possibly get any, she pined away and became quite pale and wretched. Then her husband grew alarmed and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2548'>The man, who loved her dearly, thought to himself, "Come! rather than let your wife die you shall fetch her some rampion, no matter the cost." So at dusk he climbed over the wall into the witch"s garden, and, hastily gathering a handful of rampion leaves, he returned with them to his wife. She made them into a salad, which tasted so good that her longing for the forbidden food was greater than ever. If she were to know any peace of mind, there was nothing for it but that her husband should climb over the garden wall again, and fetch her some more. So at dusk over he got, but when he reached the other side he drew back in terror, for there, standing before him, was the old witch.</paragraph>

So he wandered about for some years, as wretched and unhappy as he could well be, and at last he came to the desert place where Rapunzel was living. Of a sudden he heard a voice which seemed strangely familiar to him. He walked eagerly in the direction of the sound, and when he was quite close, Rapunzel recognised him and fell on his neck and wept.

He knocked at the stable door and it opened at once. He threw down the three little bits of bread and a hare came out and ate them. He caught the hare. Then the Eagle told him to pluck three feathers out of its tail, and put in the hare, the stone, the splinters of wood and himself instead of them, and then he would be able to carry them all home.</paragraph>

She ran as far as her legs would carry her, and as evening approached she saw a little house, and she stepped inside to rest. Everything was very small in the little house, but cleaner and neater than anything you can imagine. In the middle of the room there stood a little table, covered with a white tablecloth, and seven little plates and forks and spoons and knives and tumblers. Side by side against the wall there were seven little beds, covered with snow-white counterpanes. Snowdrop felt so hungry and so thirsty that she ate a bit of bread and a little porridge from each plate, and drank a drop of wine out of each tumbler. Then feeling tired and sleepy she lay down on one of the beds, but it wasn"t comfortable; then she tried all the others in turn, but one was too long, and another too short, and it was only when she got to the seventh that she found one to suit her exactly.

She was under a spell, so that she must always sleep in a castle surrounded by flaming fire; there she must sleep for ever till there came a knight who would ride through the fire and waken her. There he determined to go, but first he rode right down the horrible trail of Fafnir. And Fafnir had lived in a cave with iron doors, a cave dug deep down in the earth, and full of gold bracelets, and crowns, and rings; and there, too, Sigurd found the Helm of Dread, a golden helmet, and whoever wears it is invisible. All these he piled on the back of the good horse <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;back' adjectives='good' verbs='ride;pile' valence='5.97' arousal='3.90333333333' dominance='5.51333333333'>Grani</entity>, and then he rode south to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;back' adjectives='good' verbs='ride;pile' valence='5.97' arousal='3.90333333333' dominance='5.51333333333'>Hindfell</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='3414'>Now it was night, and on the crest of the hill Sigurd saw a red fire blazing up into the sky, and within the flame a castle, and a banner on the topmost tower. Then he set the horse Grani at the fire, and he leaped through it lightly, as if it had been through the heather. So Sigurd went within the castle door, and there he saw someone sleeping, clad all in armour. Then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper, and behold, she was a most beautiful lady. And she wakened and said, "Ah! is it <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;curse;son' adjectives='last' verbs='break;be;waken;come;have' valence='5.03' arousal='4.37625' dominance='5.13375'>Sigurd</entity>, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;curse;son' adjectives='last' verbs='break;be;waken;come;have' valence='5.03' arousal='4.37625' dominance='5.13375'>Sigmund</entity>"s son, who has broken the curse, and comes here to waken me at last?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='3415'>This curse came upon her when the thorn of the tree of sleep ran into her hand long ago as a punishment because she had displeased Odin the God. Long ago, too, she had vowed never to marry a man who knew fear, and dared not ride through the fence of flaming fire. For she was a warrior maid herself, and went armed into the battle like a man. But now she and Sigurd loved each other, and promised to be true to each other, and he gave her a ring, and it was the last ring taken from the dwarf Andvari. Then Sigurd rode away, and he came to the house of a King who had a fair daughter. Her name was Gudrun, and her mother was a witch. Now Gudrun fell in love with Sigurd, but he was always talking of Brynhild, how beautiful she was and how dear.

	<paragraph num_entities='8' num='3416'>Now the witch, the mother of Gudrun, wanted her son Gunnar to marry Brynhild, and she bade him ride out with Sigurd and go and woo her. So forth they rode to her father"s house, for Brynhild had quite gone out of Sigurd"s mind by reason of the witch"s wine, but she remembered him and loved him still. Then Brynhild"s father told Gunnar that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower, and thither they rode, and Gunnar set his horse at the flame, but he would not face it. Then Gunnar tried Sigurd"s horse Grani, but he would not move with Gunnar on his back.

Then he rode out again, and he and Gunnar changed shapes, and each was himself again, and they went home to the witch Queen"s, and Sigurd gave the dwarf"s ring to his wife, Gudrun. And Brynhild went to her father, and said that a King had come called Gunnar, and had ridden the fire, and she must marry him.

But Sigurd woke, and caught the sword Gram into his hand, and threw it at the man as he fled, and the sword cut him in twain. Thus died Sigurd, Fafnir"s bane, whom no ten men could have slain in fair fight. Then Gudrun wakened and saw him dead, and she moaned aloud, and Brynhild heard her and laughed; but the kind horse Grani lay down and died of very grief. And then Brynhild fell a-weeping till her heart broke. So they attired Sigurd in all his golden armour, and built a great pile of wood on board his ship, and at night laid on it the dead Sigurd and the dead Brynhild, and the good horse, Grani, and set fire to it, and launched the ship. And the wind bore it blazing out to sea, flaming into the dark. So there were Sigurd and Brynhild burned together, and the curse of the dwarf Andvari was fulfilled.(33)</paragraph>

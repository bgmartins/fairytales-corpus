	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='13'>PREFACE</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='14'>The Editor thinks that children will readily forgive him for publishing another Fairy Book. We have had the Blue, the Red, the Green, and here is the Yellow. If children are pleased, and they are so kind as to say that they are pleased, the Editor does not care very much for what other people may say. Now, there is one gentleman who seems to think that it is not quite right to print so many fairy tales, with pictures, and to publish them in red and blue covers. He is named Mr. G. Laurence Gomme, and he is president of a learned body called the Folk Lore Society. Once a year he makes his address to his subjects, of whom the Editor is one, and Mr. Joseph Jacobs (who has published many delightful fairy tales with pretty pictures)(1) is another. Fancy, then, the dismay of Mr. Jacobs, and of the Editor, when they heard their president say that he did not think it very nice in them to publish fairy books, above all, red, green, and blue fairy books! They said that they did not see any harm in it, and they were ready to "put themselves on their country," and be tried by a jury of children. And, indeed, they still see no harm in what they have done; nay, like <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='poem;harm;nay' adjectives='ready' verbs='do;see;have;be' valence='5.862' arousal='4.022' dominance='5.771'>Father William</entity> in the poem, they are ready "to do it again and again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='15'>(1) You may buy them from Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mr.;strand' adjectives='' verbs='buy' valence='5.5925' arousal='3.9375' dominance='5.7175'>Nutt</entity>, in the Strand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='16'>Where is the harm? The truth is that the Folk Lore Society--made up of the most clever, learned, and beautiful men and women of the country--is fond of studying the history and geography of Fairy Land. This is contained in very old tales, such as country people tell, and savages:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='17'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='18'>"Little Sioux and little Crow,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='19'>Little frosty Eskimo."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='20'>These people are thought to know most about fairyland and its inhabitants. But, in the Yellow Fairy Book, and the rest, are many tales by persons who are neither savages nor rustics, such as Madame D"Aulnoy and Herr Hans Christian Andersen. The Folk Lore Society, or its president, say that THEIR tales are not so true as the rest, and should not be published with the rest. But WE say that all the stories which are pleasant to read are quite true enough for us; so here they are, with pictures by Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='picture;we;child;story;mr.' adjectives='pleasant;likely;true' verbs='be;do;read;mislead;say;think' valence='6.41277777778' arousal='3.90222222222' dominance='5.99611111111'>Ford</entity>, and we do not think that either the pictures or the stories are likely to mislead children.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'>As to whether there are really any fairies or not, that is a difficult question. Professor Huxley thinks there are none. The Editor never saw any himself, but he knows several people who have seen them--in the Highlands--and heard their music. If ever you are in Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music yourself, as grown-up people have done, but you must goon a fine day. Again, if there are really no fairies, why do people believe in them, all over the world? The ancient Greeks believed, so did the old Egyptians, and the Hindoos, and the Red Indians, and is it likely, if there are no fairies, that so many different peoples would have seen and heard them? The Rev. Mr. Baring-Gould saw several fairies when he was a boy, and was travelling in the land of the Troubadours. For these reasons, the Editor thinks that there are certainly fairies, but they never do anyone any harm; and, in England, they have been frightened away by smoke and schoolmasters. As to Giants, they have died out, but real Dwarfs are common in the forests of Africa. Probably a good many stories not perfectly true have been told about fairies, but such stories have also been told about Napoleon, Claverhouse, Julius Caesar, and Joan of Arc, all of whom certainly existed. A wise child will, therefore, remember that, if he grows up and becomes a member of the Folk Lore Society, ALL the tales in this book were not offered to him as absolutely truthful, but were printed merely for his entertainment. The exact facts he can learn later, or he can leave them alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='22'>There are Russian, German, French, Icelandic, Red Indian, and other stories here. They were translated by Miss Cheape, Miss Alma, and Miss Thyra Alleyne, Miss Sellar, Mr. Craigie (he did the Icelandic tales), Miss Blackley, Mrs. Dent, and Mrs. Lang, but the Red Indian stories are copied from English versions published by the Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology, in America. Mr. Ford did the pictures, and it is hoped that children will find the book not less pleasing than those which have already been submitted to their consideration. The Editor cannot say "good-bye" without advising them, as they pursue their studies, to read The Rose and the Ring, by the late Mr. Thackeray, with pictures by the author. This book he thinks quite indispensable in every child"s library, and parents should be urged to purchase it at the first opportunity, as without it no education is complete.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='79'>THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='80'>A cat had made acquaintance with a mouse, and had spoken so much of the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at last the Mouse consented to live in the same house with her, and to go shares in the housekeeping. "But we must provide for the winter or else we shall suffer hunger," said the Cat. "You, little Mouse, cannot venture everywhere in case you run at last into a trap." This good counsel was followed, and a little pot of fat was bought. But they did not know where to put it. At length, after long consultation, the Cat said, "I know of no place where it could be better put than in the church. No one will trouble to take it away from there. We will hide it in a corner, and we won"t touch it till we are in want." So the little pot was placed in safety; but it was not long before the Cat had a great longing for it, and said to the Mouse, "I wanted to tell you, little Mouse, that my cousin has a little son, white with brown spots, and she wants me to be godmother to it. Let me go out to-day, and do you take care of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='care' adjectives='to-day' verbs='go;do;let;take' valence='5.7725' arousal='3.9225' dominance='5.63'>the house</entity> alone."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='81'>"Yes, go certainly," replied the Mouse, "and when you eat anything good, think of me; I should very much like a drop of the red christening wine."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='82'>But it was all untrue. The Cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, slunk to the little pot of fat, began to lick it, and licked the top off. Then she took a walk on the roofs of the town, looked at the view, stretched herself out in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the little pot of fat. As soon as it was evening she went home again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='83'>"Ah, here you are again!" said the Mouse; "you must certainly have had an enjoyable day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>"It went off very well," answered the Cat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>"What was the child"s name?" asked the Mouse.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>"Top Off," said the Cat drily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>"Topoff!" echoed the Mouse, "it is indeed a wonderful and curious name. Is it in your family?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='88'>"What is there odd about it?" said the Cat. "It is not worse than <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='godchild' adjectives='worse' verbs='be;call' valence='6.18' arousal='3.38333333333' dominance='5.53666666667'>Breadthief</entity>, as your godchild is called."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='89'>Not long after this another great longing came over the Cat. She said to the Mouse, "You must again be kind enough to look after <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='neck;godmother;time;child;ring;mouse;round' adjectives='white' verbs='be;refuse;look;say;stand;have;ask' valence='5.74851851852' arousal='3.92037037037' dominance='5.47296296296'>the house</entity> alone, for I have been asked a second time to stand godmother, and as this child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>The kind Mouse agreed, but the Cat slunk under the town wall to the church, and ate up half of the pot of fat. "Nothing tastes better," said she, "than what one eats by oneself," and she was very much pleased with her day"s work. When she came home the Mouse asked, "What was this child called?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>"Half Gone," answered the Cat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='92'>"Halfgone! what a name! I have never heard it in my life. I don"t believe it is in the calendar."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='93'>Soon the Cat"s mouth began to water once more after her licking business. "All good things in threes," she said to the Mouse; "I have again to stand godmother. The child is quite black, and has very white paws, but not a single white hair on its body. This only happens once in two years, so you will let me go out?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='94'>"Topoff! Halfgone!" repeated the Mouse, "they are such curious names; they make me very thoughtful."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='95'>"Oh, you sit at home in your dark grey coat and your long tail," said the Cat, "and you get fanciful. That comes of not going out in the day."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='96'>The Mouse had a good cleaning out while the Cat was gone, and made <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='bit;mouse;cleaning;cat' adjectives='good;tidy;fat;greedy' verbs='go;be;make;eat;have' valence='5.764' arousal='4.01466666667' dominance='5.55866666667'>the house</entity> tidy; but the greedy Cat ate the fat every bit up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>"When it is all gone one can be at rest," she said to herself, and at night she came home sleek and satisfied. The Mouse asked at once after the third child"s name.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>"It won"t please you any better," said the Cat, "he was called Clean Gone."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='99'>"Cleangone!" repeated the Mouse. "I do not believe that name has been printed any more than the others. Cleangone! What can it mean?" She shook her head, curled herself up, and went to sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='100'>From this time on no one asked the Cat to stand godmother; but when the winter came and there was nothing to be got outside, the Mouse remembered their provision and said, "Come, Cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored away; it will taste very good."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='101'>"Yes, indeed," answered the Cat; "it will taste as good to you as if you stretched your thin tongue out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tongue;cat' adjectives='good;thin' verbs='answer;taste;stretch' valence='6.23555555556' arousal='4.04111111111' dominance='6.11666666667'>the window</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='102'>They started off, and when they reached it they found the pot in its place, but quite empty!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='103'>"Ah," said the Mouse," "now I know what has happened! It has all come out! You are a true friend to me! You have eaten it all when you stood godmother; first the top off, then half of it gone, then----"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='104'>"Will you be quiet!" screamed the Cat. "Another word and I will eat you up."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='105'>"Clean-gone" was already on the poor Mouse"s tongue, and scarcely was it out than the Cat made a spring at her, seized and swallowed her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='106'>You see that is <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='world' adjectives='' verbs='be;see' valence='6.205' arousal='3.695' dominance='5.3625'>the way</entity> of the world.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='109'>A king was once hunting in a great wood, and he hunted the game so eagerly that none of his courtiers could follow him. When evening came on he stood still and looked round him, and he saw that he had quite lost himself. He sought a way out, but could find none. Then he saw an old woman with a shaking head coming towards him; but she was a witch.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='110'>"Good woman," he said to her, "can you not show me <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='woman' adjectives='good' verbs='say;show' valence='6.2425' arousal='3.81625' dominance='5.96125'>the way</entity> out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='woman' adjectives='good' verbs='say;show' valence='6.2425' arousal='3.81625' dominance='5.96125'>the wood</entity>?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='114'>The King in his anguish of mind consented, and the old woman led him to her little house where her daughter was sitting by the fire. She received the King as if she were expecting him, and he saw that she was certainly very beautiful; but she did not please him, and he could not look at her without a secret feeling of horror. As soon as he had lifted the maiden on to his horse the old woman showed him <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='horse;woman;palace;maiden;wedding' adjectives='old' verbs='be;show;reach;lift;have;celebrate' valence='6.01642857143' arousal='4.27571428571' dominance='5.57928571429'>the way</entity>, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horse;woman;palace;maiden;wedding' adjectives='old' verbs='be;show;reach;lift;have;celebrate' valence='6.01642857143' arousal='4.27571428571' dominance='5.57928571429'>the King</entity> reached his palace, where the wedding was celebrated.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='115'>The King had already been married once, and had by his first wife seven children, six boys and one girl, whom he loved more than anything in the world. And now, because he was afraid that their stepmother might not treat them well and might do them harm, he put them in a lonely castle that stood in the middle of a wood. It lay so hidden, and the way to it was so hard to find, that he himself could not have found it out had not a wise-woman given him a reel of thread which possessed a marvellous property: when he threw it before him it unwound itself and showed him the way. But the King went so often to his dear children that the Queen was offended at his absence. She grew curious, and wanted to know what he had to do quite alone in the wood. She gave his servants a great deal of money, and they betrayed the secret to her, and also told her of the reel which alone could point out the way. She had no rest now till she had found out where <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='enchantment;witch-mother;reel;shirt;rest' adjectives='little;white' verbs='sew;make;guard;have;learn;find' valence='6.08375' arousal='3.80125' dominance='5.599375'>the King</entity> guarded the reel, and then she made some little white shirts, and, as she had learnt from her witch-mother, sewed an enchantment in each of them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='116'>And when the King had ridden off she took the little shirts and went into the wood, and the reel showed her the way.

And she told him that looking out of her little window she had seen her brothers flying over the wood in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers which they had let fall in the yard, and which she had collected. The King mourned, but he did not think that the Queen had done the wicked deed, and as he was afraid the maiden would also be taken from him, he wanted to take her with him. But she was afraid of the stepmother, and begged the King to let her stay just one night more in the castle in the wood. The poor maiden thought, "My home is no longer here; I will go and seek my brothers." And when night came she fled away into the forest. She ran all through the night and the next day, till she could go no farther for weariness. Then she saw a little hut, went in, and found a room with six little beds. She was afraid to lie down on one, so she crept under one of them, lay on the hard floor, and was going to spend the night there. But when the sun had set she heard a noise, and saw six swans flying in at the window. They stood on the floor and blew at one another, and blew all their feathers off, and their swan-skin came off like a shirt. Then the maiden recognised her brothers, and overjoyed she crept out from under the bed. Her brothers were not less delighted than she to see their little sister again, but their joy did not last long.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='124'>"Oh, no," they said, "the conditions are too hard. You must not speak or laugh for six years, and must make in that time six shirts for us out of star-flowers.

She left the hut, went into the forest, climbed a tree, and spent the night there. The next morning she went out, collected star-flowers, and began to sew. She could speak to no one, and she had no wish to laugh, so she sat there, looking only at her work.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>When she had lived there some time, it happened that the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and his hunters came to the tree on which the maiden sat. They called to her and said "Who are you?"</paragraph>

There he had her dressed in rich clothes, and her beauty shone out as bright as day, but not a word could be drawn from her. He set her at table by his side, and her modest ways and behaviour pleased him so much that he said, "I will marry this maiden and none other in the world," and after some days he married her.

The next time she had a child the wicked mother did the same thing, but the King could not make up his mind to believe her. He said, "She is too sweet and good to do such a thing as that. If she were not dumb and could defend herself, her innocence would be proved." But when the third child was taken away, and the Queen was again accused, and could not utter a word in her own defence, the King was obliged to give her over to the law, which decreed that she must be burnt to death. When the day came on which the sentence was to be executed, it was the last day of the six years in which she must not speak or laugh, and now she had freed her dear brothers from the power of the enchantment.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='139'>Very long ago, as old people have told me, there lived a terrible monster, who came out of the North, and laid waste whole tracts of country, devouring both men and beasts; and this monster was so destructive that it was feared that unless help came no living creature would be left on the face of the earth. It had a body like an ox, and legs like a frog, two short fore-legs, and two long ones behind, and besides that it had a tail like a serpent, ten fathoms in length. When it moved it jumped like a frog, and with every spring it covered half a mile of ground. Fortunately its habit, was to remain for several years in the same place, and not to move on till the whole neighbourhood was eaten up. Nothing could hunt it, because its whole body was covered with scales, which were harder than stone or metal; its two great eyes shone by night, and even by day, like the brightest lamps, and anyone who had the ill luck to look into those eyes became as it were bewitched, and was obliged to rush of his own accord into the monster"s jaws. In this way the Dragon was able to feed upon both men and beasts without the least trouble to itself, as it needed not to move from the spot where it was lying. All the neighbouring kings had offered rich rewards to anyone who should be able to destroy the monster, either by force or enchantment, and many had tried their luck, but all had miserably failed. Once a great forest in which the Dragon lay had been set on fire; the forest was burnt down, but the fire did not do the monster the least harm. However, there was a tradition amongst the wise men of the country that the Dragon might be overcome by one who possessed King Solomon"s signet-ring, upon which a secret writing was engraved. This inscription would enable anyone who was wise enough to interpret it to find out how the Dragon could be destroyed. Only no one knew where the ring was hidden, nor was there any sorcerer or learned man to be found who would be able to explain the inscription.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='140'>At last a young man, with a good heart and plenty of courage, set out to search for the ring.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='145'>From that time the youth never felt lonely as he walked along; he always had company, because he understood the language of birds; and in this way he learned many things which mere human knowledge could never have taught him. But time went on, and he heard nothing about the ring. It happened one evening, when he was hot and tired with walking, and had sat down under a tree in a forest to eat his supper, that he saw two gaily-plumaged birds, that were strange to him, sitting at the top of the tree talking to one another about him. The first bird said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='146'>"I know that wandering fool under the tree there, who has come so far without finding what he seeks.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='147'>The other bird answered, "He will have to seek help from the Witch-maiden,(3) who will doubtless be able to put him on the right track. If she has not got the ring herself, she knows well enough who has it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='149'>"But where is he to find the Witch-maiden?" said the first bird. "She has no settled dwelling, but is here to-day and gone to-morrow. He might as well try to catch the wind."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='150'>The other replied, "I do not know, certainly, where she is at present, but in three nights from now she will come to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='youth;moon;bloom;order;face' adjectives='wrinkled;other;old;full' verbs='be;do;keep;wash;know;reply;come;grow' valence='5.88' arousal='3.74392857143' dominance='5.81107142857'>the spring</entity> to wash her face, as she does every month when the moon is full, in order that she may never grow old nor wrinkled, but may always keep the bloom of youth."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='151'>"Well," said the first bird, "the spring is not far from here. Shall we go and see how it is she does it?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='152'>"Willingly, if you like," said the other.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='153'>The youth immediately resolved to follow the birds to the spring, only two things made him uneasy: first, lest he might be asleep when the birds went, and secondly, lest he might lose sight of them, since he had not wings to carry him along so swiftly. He was too tired to keep awake all night, yet his anxiety prevented him from sleeping soundly, and when with the earliest dawn he looked up to the tree-top, he was glad to see his feathered companions still asleep with their heads under their wings. He ate his breakfast, and waited until the birds should start, but they did not leave the place all day. They hopped about from one tree to another looking for food, all day long until the evening, when they went back to their old perch to sleep. The next day the same thing happened, but on the third morning one bird said to the other, "To-day we must go to the spring to see the Witch-maiden wash her face." They remained on the tree till noon; then they flew away and went towards the south. The young man"s heart beat with anxiety lest he should lose sight of his guides, but he managed to keep the birds in view until they again perched upon a tree. The young man ran after them until he was quite exhausted and out of breath, and after three short rests the birds at length reached a small open space in the forest, on the edge of which they placed themselves on the top of a high tree. When the youth had overtaken them, he saw that there was a clear spring in the middle of the space. He sat down at the foot of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foot;bird' adjectives='other' verbs='be;say;listen;perch;sit' valence='6.078' arousal='3.437' dominance='5.823'>the tree</entity> upon which the birds were perched, and listened attentively to what they were saying to each other.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='154'>"The sun is not down yet," said the first bird; "we must wait yet awhile till the moon rises and the maiden comes to the spring. Do you think she will see that young man sitting under <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='man' adjectives='young' verbs='do;see;think;sit' valence='6.1025' arousal='3.56625' dominance='6.0225'>the tree</entity>?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='156'>"We will wait," said the first bird, "and see how they get on together."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='157'>The evening light had quite faded, and the full moon was already shining down upon the forest, when the young man heard a slight rustling sound. After a few moments there came out of the forest a maiden, gliding over the grass so lightly that her feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground, and stood beside the spring. The youth could not turn away his eyes from the maiden, for he had never in his life seen a woman so beautiful. Without seeming to notice anything, she went to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='song;face;time;anything;moon' adjectives='full' verbs='notice;look;bath;go;sing;seem;walk;round;kneel' valence='6.24523809524' arousal='3.69428571429' dominance='5.76714285714'>the spring</entity>, looked up to the full moon, then knelt down and bathed her face nine times, then looked up to the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='song;face;time;anything;moon' adjectives='full' verbs='notice;look;bath;go;sing;seem;walk;round;kneel' valence='6.24523809524' arousal='3.69428571429' dominance='5.76714285714'>moon</entity> again and walked nine times round <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='song;face;time;anything;moon' adjectives='full' verbs='notice;look;bath;go;sing;seem;walk;round;kneel' valence='6.24523809524' arousal='3.69428571429' dominance='5.76714285714'>the well</entity>, and as she walked she sang this song:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='158'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='159'>"Full-faced moon with light unshaded,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='160'>Let my beauty ne"er be faded.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='164'>May her freshness never fail!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='165'>Then she dried her face with her long hair, and was about to go away, when her eye suddenly fell upon the spot where the young man was sitting, and she turned towards the tree. The youth rose and stood waiting. Then the maiden said, "You ought to have a heavy punishment because you have presumed to watch my secret doings in the moonlight. But I will forgive you this time, because you are a stranger and knew no better. But you must tell me truly who you are and how you came to this place, where no mortal has ever set foot before."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='166'>The youth answered humbly: "Forgive me, beautiful maiden, if I have unintentionally offended you. I chanced to come here after long wandering, and found a good place to sleep under this tree. At your coming I did not know what to do, but stayed where I was, because I thought my silent watching could not offend you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='167'>The maiden answered kindly, "Come and spend this night with us. You will sleep better on a pillow than on damp moss."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='168'>The youth hesitated for a little, but presently he heard the birds saying from the top of the tree, "Go where she calls you, but take care to give no blood, or you will sell your soul." So the youth went with her, and soon they reached a beautiful garden, where stood a splendid house, which glittered in the moonlight as if it was all built out of gold and silver. When the youth entered he found many splendid chambers, each one finer than the last. Hundreds of tapers burnt upon golden candlesticks, and shed a light like the brightest day. At length they reached a chamber where a table was spread with the most costly dishes. At the table were placed two chairs, one of silver, the other of gold. The maiden seated herself upon the golden chair, and offered the silver one to her companion. They were served by maidens dressed in white, whose feet made no sound as they moved about, and not a word was spoken during the meal. Afterwards the youth and the Witch-maiden conversed pleasantly together, until a woman, dressed in red, came in to remind them that it was bedtime. The youth was now shown into another room, containing a silken bed with down cushions, where he slept delightfully, yet he seemed to hear a voice near his bed which repeated to him, "Remember to give no blood!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='169'>The next morning the maiden asked him whether he would not like to stay with her always in this beautiful place, and as he did not answer immediately, she continued: "You see how I always remain young and beautiful, and I am under no one"s orders, but can do just what I like, so that I have never thought of marrying before. But from the moment I saw you I took a fancy to you, so if you agree, we might be married and might live together like princes, because I have great riches."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='170'>The youth could not but be tempted with the beautiful maiden"s offer, but he remembered how the birds had called her the witch, and their warning always sounded in his ears. Therefore he answered cautiously, "Do not be angry, dear maiden, if I do not decide immediately on this important matter. Give me a few days to consider before we come to an understanding."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='171'>"Why not?" answered the maiden. "Take some weeks to consider if you like, and take counsel with your own heart." And to make the time pass pleasantly, she took the youth over every part of her beautiful dwelling, and showed him all her splendid treasures. But these treasures were all produced by enchantment, for the maiden could make anything she wished appear by the help of King Solomon"s signet ring; only none of these things remained fixed; they passed away like the wind without leaving a trace behind. But the youth did not know this; he thought they were all real.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='172'>One day the maiden took him into a secret chamber, where a little gold box was standing on a silver table. Pointing to the box, she said, "Here is my greatest treasure, whose like is not to be found in the whole world. It is a precious gold ring. When you marry me, I will give you this ring as a marriage gift, and it will make you the happiest of mortal men. But in order that our love may last for ever, you must give me for the ring three drops of blood from the little finger of your left hand."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='173'>When the youth heard these words a cold shudder ran over him, for he remembered that his soul was at stake. He was cunning enough, however, to conceal his feelings and to make no direct answer, but he only asked the maiden, as if carelessly, what was remarkable about the ring?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='174'>She answered, "No mortal is able entirely to understand the power of this ring, because no one thoroughly understands the secret signs engraved upon it. But even with my half-knowledge I can work great wonders. If I put the ring upon the little finger of my left hand, then I can fly like a bird through the air wherever I wish to go. If I put it on the third finger of my left hand I am invisible, and I can see everything that passes around me, though no one can see me. If I put the ring upon the middle finger of my left hand, then neither fire nor water nor any sharp weapon can hurt me. If I put it on the forefinger of my left hand, then I can with its help produce whatever I wish. I can in a single moment build houses or anything I desire. Finally, as long as I wear the ring on the thumb of my left hand, that hand is so strong that it can break down rocks and walls. Besides these, the ring has other secret signs which, as I said, no one can understand. No doubt it contains secrets of great importance. The ring formerly belonged to King Solomon, the wisest of kings, during whose reign the wisest men lived. But it is not known whether this ring was ever made by mortal hands: it is supposed that an angel gave it to the wise <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ring;angel;hand' adjectives='wise;mortal' verbs='be;make;suppose;know;give' valence='6.29285714286' arousal='3.95428571429' dominance='5.56785714286'>King</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='175'>When the youth heard all this he determined to try and get possession of the ring, though he did not quite believe in all its wonderful gifts. He wished the maiden would let him have it in his hand, but he did not quite like to ask her to do so, and after a while she put it back into the box. A few days after they were again speaking of the magic ring, and the youth said, "I do not think it possible that the ring can have all the power you say it has."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='176'>Then the maiden opened the box and took the ring out, and it glittered as she held it like the clearest sunbeam. She put it on the middle finger of her left hand, and told the youth to take a knife and try as hard as he could to cut her with it, for he would not be able to hurt her. He was unwilling at first, but the maiden insisted. Then he tried, at first only in play, and then seriously, to strike her with the knife, but an invisible wall of iron seemed to be between them, and the maiden stood before him laughing and unhurt. Then she put the ring on her third finger, and in an instant she had vanished from his eyes. Presently she was beside him again laughing, and holding the ring between her fingers.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='180'>"Oh, the middle finger of your left hand," the maiden answered, laughing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='181'>She took the knife and tried to strike the youth, and he even tried to cut himself with it, but found it impossible. Then he asked the maiden to show him how to split stones and rocks with the help of the ring. So she led him into a courtyard where stood a great boulder-stone. "Now," she said, "put the ring upon the thumb of your left hand, and you will see how strong that hand has become. The youth did so, and found to his astonishment that with a single blow of his fist the stone flew into a thousand pieces. Then the youth bethought him that he who does not use his luck when he has it is a fool, and that this was a chance which once lost might never return. So while they stood laughing at the shattered stone he placed the ring, as if in play, upon the third finger of his left hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='182'>"Now," said the maiden, "you are invisible to me until you take the ring off again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='183'>But the youth had no mind to do that; on the contrary, he went farther off, then put the ring on the little finger of his left hand, and soared into the air like a bird.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='184'>When the maiden saw him flying away she thought at first that he was still in play, and cried, "Come back, friend, for now you see I have told you the truth." But the young man never came back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='185'>Then the maiden saw she was deceived, and bitterly repented that she had ever trusted him with the ring.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='186'>The young man never halted in his flight until he reached the dwelling of the wise magician who had taught him the speech of birds. The magician was delighted to find that his search had been successful, and at once set to work to interpret the secret signs engraved upon the ring, but it took him seven weeks to make them out clearly. Then he gave the youth the following instructions how to overcome the Dragon of the North: "You must have an iron horse cast, which must have little wheels under each foot. You must also be armed with a spear two fathoms long, which you will be able to wield by means of the magic ring upon your left thumb. The spear must be as thick in the middle as a large tree, and both its ends must be sharp. In the middle of the spear you must have two strong chains ten fathoms in length. As soon as the Dragon has made himself fast to the spear, which you must thrust through his jaws, you must spring quickly from the iron horse and fasten the ends of the chains firmly to the ground with iron stakes, so that he cannot get away from them. After two or three days the monster"s strength will be so far exhausted that you will be able to come near him. Then you can put Solomon"s ring upon your left thumb and give him the finishing stroke, but keep the ring on your third finger until you have come close to him, so that the monster cannot see you, else he might strike you dead with his long tail. But when all is done, take care you do not lose the ring, and that no one takes it from you by cunning."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='187'>The young man thanked the magician for his directions, and promised, should they succeed, to reward him. But the magician answered, "I have profited so much by the wisdom the ring has taught me that I desire no other reward." Then they parted, and the youth quickly flew home through the air. After remaining in his own home for some weeks, he heard people say that the terrible Dragon of the North was not far off, and might shortly be expected in the country. The King announced publicly that he would give his daughter in marriage, as well as a large part of his kingdom, to whosoever should free the country from the monster. The youth then went to the King and told him that he had good hopes of subduing the Dragon, if the King would grant him all he desired for the purpose. The King willingly agreed, and the iron horse, the great spear, and the chains were all prepared as the youth requested. When all was ready, it was found that the iron horse was so heavy that a hundred men could not move it from the spot, so the youth found there was nothing for it but to move it with his own strength by means of the magic ring. The Dragon was now so near that in a couple of springs he would be over the frontier. The youth now began to consider how he should act, for if he had to push the iron horse from behind he could not ride upon it as the sorcerer had said he must. But a raven unexpectedly gave him this advice: "Ride upon the horse, and push the spear against the ground, as if you were pushing off a boat from the land." The youth did so, and found that in this way he could easily move forwards. The Dragon had his monstrous jaws wide open, all ready for his expected prey. A few paces nearer, and man and horse would have been swallowed up by them! The youth trembled with horror, and his blood ran cold, yet he did not lose his courage; but, holding the iron spear upright in his hand, he brought it down with all his might right through the monster"s lower jaw. Then quick as lightning he sprang from his horse before the Dragon had time to shut his mouth. A fearful clap like thunder, which could be heard for miles around, now warned him that the Dragon"s jaws had closed upon the spear. When the youth turned round he saw the point of the spear sticking up high above the Dragon"s upper jaw, and knew that the other end must be fastened firmly to the ground; but the Dragon had got his teeth fixed in the iron horse, which was now useless. The youth now hastened to fasten down the chains to the ground by means of the enormous iron pegs which he had provided. The death struggle of the monster lasted three days and three nights; in his writhing he beat his tail so violently against the ground, that at ten miles" distance the earth trembled as if with an earthquake. When he at length lost power to move his tail, the youth with the help of the ring took up a stone which twenty ordinary men could not have moved, and beat the Dragon so hard about the head with it that very soon the monster lay lifeless before him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='188'>You can fancy how great was the rejoicing when the news was spread abroad that the terrible monster was dead. His conqueror was received into the city with as much pomp as if he had been the mightiest of kings. The old King did not need to urge his daughter to marry the slayer of the Dragon; he found her already willing to bestow her hand upon this hero, who had done all alone what whole armies had tried in vain to do. In a few days a magnificent wedding was celebrated, at which the rejoicings lasted four whole weeks, for all the neighbouring kings had met together to thank the man who had freed the world from their common enemy. But everyone forgot amid the general joy that they ought to have buried the Dragon"s monstrous body, for it began now to have such a bad smell that no one could live in the neighbourhood, and before long the whole air was poisoned, and a pestilence broke out which destroyed many hundreds of people. In this distress, the King"s son-in-law resolved to seek help once more from the Eastern magician, to whom he at once travelled through the air like a bird by the help of the ring. But there is a proverb which says that ill-gotten gains never prosper, and the Prince found that the stolen ring brought him ill-luck after all. The Witch-maiden had never rested night nor day until she had found out where the ring was. As soon as she had discovered by means of magical arts that the Prince in the form of a bird was on his way to the Eastern magician, she changed herself into an eagle and watched in the air until the bird she was waiting for came in sight, for she knew him at once by the ring which was hung round his neck by a ribbon. Then the eagle pounced upon the bird, and the moment she seized him in her talons she tore the ring from his neck before the man in bird"s shape had time to prevent her. Then the eagle flew down to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='eagle;prey;form;face' adjectives='human' verbs='fly;stand;face' valence='5.948' arousal='4.215' dominance='5.434'>the earth</entity> with her prey, and the two stood face to face once more in human form.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='189'>"Now, villain, you are in my power!" cried the Witch-maiden. "I favoured you with my love, and you repaid me with treachery and theft. You stole my most precious jewel from me, and do you expect to live happily as the King"s son-in-law? Now the tables are turned; you are in my power, and I will be revenged on you for your crimes."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='190'>"Forgive me! forgive me!" cried the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='most' verbs='do;cry;repent;wrong;know;have' valence='4.939' arousal='4.557' dominance='4.76'>Prince</entity>; "I know too well how deeply I have wronged you, and most heartily do I repent it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='191'>The maiden answered, "Your prayers and your repentance come too late, and if I were to spare you everyone would think me a fool. You have doubly wronged me; first you scorned my love, and then you stole my ring, and you must bear the punishment."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='192'>With these words she put the ring upon her left thumb, lifted the young man with one hand, and walked away with him under her arm. This time she did not take him to a splendid palace, but to a deep cave in a rock, where there were chains hanging from the wall. The maiden now chained the young man"s hands and feet so that he could not escape; then she said in an angry voice, "Here you shall remain chained up until you die. I will bring you every day enough food to prevent you dying of hunger, but you need never hope for freedom any more." With these words she left him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='193'>The old King and his daughter waited anxiously for many weeks for the Prince"s return, but no news of him arrived. The King"s daughter often dreamed that her husband was going through some great suffering: she therefore begged her father to summon all the enchanters and magicians, that they might try to find out where the Prince was and how he could be set free. But the magicians, with all their arts, could find out nothing, except that he was still living and undergoing great suffering; but none could tell where he was to be found. At last a celebrated magician from Finland was brought before the King, who had found out that the King"s son-in-law was imprisoned in the East, not by men, but by some more powerful being. The King now sent messengers to the East to look for his son-in-law, and they by good luck met with the old magician who had interpreted the signs on King Solomon"s ring, and thus was possessed of more wisdom than anyone else in the world. The magician soon found out what he wished to know, and pointed out the place where the Prince was imprisoned, but said: "He is kept there by enchantment, and cannot be set free without my help. I will therefore go with you myself."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='194'>So they all set out, guided by birds, and after some days came to the cave where the unfortunate Prince had been chained up for nearly seven years. He recognised the magician immediately, but the old man did not know him, he had grown so thin. However, he undid the chains by the help of magic, and took care of the Prince until he recovered and became strong enough to travel. When he reached home he found that the old King had died that morning, so that he was now raised to the throne. And now after his long suffering came prosperity, which lasted to the end of his life; but he never got back the magic ring, nor has it ever again been seen by mortal eyes.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='199'>Many years ago there lived an Emperor who was so fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on them in order to be beautifully dressed. He did not care about his soldiers, he did not care about the theatre; he only liked to go out walking to show off his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and just as they say of a king, "He is in the council-chamber," they always said here, "The Emperor is in the wardrobe."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='200'>In the great city in which he lived there was always something going on; every day many strangers came there. One day two impostors arrived who gave themselves out as weavers, and said that they knew how to manufacture the most beautiful cloth imaginable. Not only were the texture and pattern uncommonly beautiful, but the clothes which were made of the stuff possessed this wonderful property that they were invisible to anyone who was not fit for his office, or who was unpardonably stupid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='201'>"Those must indeed be splendid clothes," thought the Emperor. "If I had them on I could find out which men in my kingdom are unfit for the offices they hold; I could distinguish the wise from the stupid! Yes, this cloth must be woven for me at once." And he gave both the impostors much money, so that they might begin their work.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='202'>They placed two weaving-looms, and began to do as if they were working, but they had not the least thing on the looms. They also demanded the finest silk and the best gold, which they put in their pockets, and worked at the empty looms till late into the night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='203'>"I should like very much to know how far they have got on with the cloth," thought the Emperor. But he remembered when he thought about it that whoever was stupid or not fit for his office would not be able to see it. Now he certainly believed that he had nothing to fear for himself, but he wanted first to send somebody else in order to see how he stood with regard to his office. Everybody in the whole town knew what a wonderful power the cloth had, and they were all curious to see how bad or how stupid their neighbour was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='204'>"I will send my old and honoured minister to the weavers," thought the Emperor. "He can judge best what the cloth is like, for he has intellect, and no one understands his office better than he."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='205'>Now the good old minister went into the hall where the two impostors sat working at the empty weaving-looms. "Dear me!" thought the old minister, opening his eyes wide, "I can see nothing!" But he did not say so.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='206'>Both the impostors begged him to be so kind as to step closer, and asked him if it were not a beautiful texture and lovely colours. They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister went forward rubbing his eyes; but he could see nothing, for there was nothing there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='207'>"Dear, dear!" thought he, "can I be stupid? I have never thought that, and nobody must know it! Can I be not fit for my office? No, I must certainly not say that I cannot see the cloth!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='208'>"Have you nothing to say about it?" asked one of the men who was weaving.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='209'>"Oh, it is lovely, most lovely!" answered the old minister, looking through his spectacles. "What a texture! What colours! Yes, I will tell the Emperor that it pleases me very much."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='210'>"Now we are delighted at that," said both the weavers, and thereupon they named the colours and explained the make of the texture.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='211'>The old minister paid great attention, so that he could tell the same to the Emperor when he came back to him, which he did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='212'>The impostors now wanted more money, more silk, and more gold to use in their weaving. They put it all in their own pockets, and there came no threads on the loom, but they went on as they had done before, working at the empty loom. The Emperor soon sent another worthy statesman to see how the weaving was getting on, and whether the cloth would soon be finished. It was the same with him as the first one; he looked and looked, but because there was nothing on the empty loom he could see nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='213'>"Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?" asked the two impostors, and they pointed to and described the splendid material which was not there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='214'>"Stupid I am not!" thought the man, "so it must be my good office for which I am not fitted. It is strange, certainly, but no one must be allowed to notice it." And so he praised the cloth which he did not see, and expressed to them his delight at the beautiful colours and the splendid texture. "Yes, it is quite beautiful," he said to the Emperor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='215'>Everybody in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='everybody;cloth' adjectives='magnificent' verbs='be;talk' valence='6.312' arousal='3.544' dominance='5.772'>the town</entity> was talking of the magnificent cloth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='216'>Now the Emperor wanted to see it himself while it was still on the loom. With a great crowd of select followers, amongst whom were both the worthy statesmen who had already been there before, he went to the cunning impostors, who were now weaving with all their might, but without fibre or thread.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='217'>"Is it not splendid!" said both the old statesmen who had already been there. "See, your Majesty, what a texture! What colours!" And then they pointed to the empty loom, for they believed that the others could see the cloth quite well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='218'>"What!" thought the Emperor, "I can see nothing! This is indeed horrible! Am I stupid? Am I not fit to be Emperor? That were the most dreadful thing that could happen to me. Oh, it is very beautiful," he said. "It has my gracious approval." And then he nodded pleasantly, and examined the empty loom, for he would not say that he could see nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='219'>His whole Court round him looked and looked, and saw no more than the others; but they said like the Emperor, "Oh! it is beautiful!" And they advised him to wear these new and magnificent clothes for the first time at the great procession which was soon to take place. "Splendid! Lovely! Most beautiful!" went from mouth to mouth; everyone seemed delighted over them, and the Emperor gave to the impostors the title of Court weavers to the Emperor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='220'>Throughout the whole of the night before the morning on which the procession was to take place, the impostors were up and were working by the light of over sixteen candles. The people could see that they were very busy making the Emperor"s new clothes ready. They pretended they were taking the cloth from the loom, cut with huge scissors in the air, sewed with needles without thread, and then said at last, "Now the clothes are finished!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='221'>The Emperor came himself with his most distinguished knights, and each impostor held up his arm just as if he were holding something, and said, "See! here are the breeches! Here is the coat! Here the cloak!" and so on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='222'>"Spun clothes are so comfortable that one would imagine one had nothing on at all; but that is the beauty of it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='223'>"Yes," said all the knights, but they could see nothing, for there was nothing there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='224'>"Will it please your Majesty graciously to take off your clothes," said the impostors, "then we will put on the new clothes, here before the mirror."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='225'>The Emperor took off all his clothes, and the impostors placed themselves before him as if they were putting on each part of his new clothes which was ready, and the Emperor turned and bent himself in front of the mirror.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='226'>"How beautifully they fit! How well they sit!" said everybody. "What material! What colours! It is a gorgeous suit!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='227'>"They are waiting outside with the canopy which your Majesty is wont to have borne over you in the procession," announced the Master of the Ceremonies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='228'>"Look, I am ready," said the Emperor. "Doesn"t it sit well!" And he turned himself again to the mirror to see if his finery was on all right.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='229'>The chamberlains who were used to carry the train put their hands near the floor as if they were lifting up the train; then they did as if they were holding something in the air. They would not have it noticed that they could see nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='230'>So the Emperor went along in the procession under the splendid canopy, and all the people in the streets and at the windows said, "How matchless are the Emperor"s new clothes! That train fastened to his dress, how beautifully it hangs!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='231'>No one wished it to be noticed that he could see nothing, for then he would have been unfit for his office, or else very stupid. None of the Emperor"s clothes had met with such approval as these had.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='235'>This struck the Emperor, for it seemed to him as if they were right; but he thought to himself, "I must go on with the procession now. And the chamberlains walked along still more uprightly, holding up the train which was not there at all.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='239'>Once upon a time there was a fisherman who had a wife and three children. Every morning he used to go out fishing, and whatever fish he caught he sold to the King. One day, among the other fishes, he caught a golden crab. When he came home he put all the fishes together into a great dish, but he kept the Crab separate because it shone so beautifully, and placed it upon a high shelf in the cupboard. Now while the old woman, his wife, was cleaning the fish, and had tucked up her gown so that her feet were visible, she suddenly heard a voice, which said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='246'>One day the Crab said to the fisherman"s wife, "Go to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;s;fisherman;crab;wife' adjectives='younger' verbs='go;wish;say;marry;tell' valence='6.06' arousal='4.29928571429' dominance='5.46785714286'>the King</entity> and tell him I wish to marry his younger daughter."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='247'>The old woman went accordingly, and laid the matter before the King, who laughed a little at the notion of his daughter marrying a crab, but did not decline the proposal altogether, because he was a prudent monarch, and knew that the Crab was likely to be a prince in disguise.

When he had brought the precious robes, the Crab put on the golden garment and then crept upon the golden cushion, and in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle, where the Crab presented the other garment to his bride. Now the ceremony took place, and when the married pair were alone together the Crab made himself known to his young wife, and told her how he was the son of the greatest king in the world, and how he was enchanted, so that he became a crab by day and was a man only at night; and he could also change himself into an eagle as often as he wished. No sooner had he said this than he shook himself, and immediately became a handsome youth, but the next morning he was forced to creep back again into his crab-shell. And the same thing happened every day. But the Princess"s affection for the Crab, and the polite attention with which she behaved to him, surprised the royal family very much. They suspected some secret, but though they spied and spied, they could not discover it. Thus a year passed away, and the Princess had a son, whom she called Benjamin. But her mother still thought the whole matter very strange. At last she said to the King that he ought to ask his daughter whether she would not like to have another husband instead of the Crab?

One day an old man went to a stream to dip in a crust of bread which he was going to eat, when a dog came out of the water, snatched the bread from his hand, and ran away. The old man ran after him, but the dog reached a door, pushed it open, and ran in, the old man following him. He did not overtake the dog, but found himself above a staircase, which he descended. Then he saw before him a stately palace, and, entering, he found in a large hall a table set for twelve persons. He hid himself in the hall behind a great picture, that he might see what would happen. At noon he heard a great noise, so that he trembled with fear. When he took courage to look out from behind the picture, he saw twelve eagles flying in. At this sight his fear became still greater. The eagles flew to the basin of a fountain that was there and bathed themselves, when suddenly they were changed into twelve handsome youths. Now they seated themselves at the table, and one of them took up a goblet filled with wine, and said, "A health to my father!" And another said, "A health to my mother!" and so the healths went round. Then one of them said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='277'>Then the old man went away too, returned to the light of day, and went home. Soon after he heard that the Princess was ill, and that the only thing that did her good was having stories told to her. He therefore went to the royal castle, obtained an audience of the Princess, and told her about the strange things he had seen in the underground palace. No sooner had he finished than the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='palace' adjectives='' verbs='ask;finish;find;have' valence='6.33142857143' arousal='3.90285714286' dominance='5.80857142857'>Princess</entity> asked him whether he could find <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='palace' adjectives='' verbs='ask;finish;find;have' valence='6.33142857143' arousal='3.90285714286' dominance='5.80857142857'>the way</entity> to that palace.</paragraph>

Presently the eagles came flying in, and changed themselves into young men, and in a moment the Princess recognised her husband amongst them all, and tried to come out of her hiding-place; but the old man held her back.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='292'>Once upon a time when wishes came true there was a king"s son who was enchanted by an old witch, so that he was obliged to sit in a large iron stove in a wood. There he lived for many years, and no one could free him. At last a king"s daughter came into the wood; she had lost her way, and could not find her father"s kingdom again. She had been wandering round and round for nine days, and she came at last to the iron case. A voice came from within and asked her, "Where do you come from, and where do you want to go?" She answered, "I have lost my way to my father"s kingdom, and I shall never get home again." Then the voice from the iron stove said, "I will help you to find your home again, and that in a very short time, if you will promise to do what I ask you. I am a greater prince than you are a princess, and I will marry you." Then she grew frightened, and thought, "What can a young lassie do with an iron stove?" But as she wanted very much to go home to her father, she promised to do what he wished.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='293'>He said, "You must come again, and bring a knife with you to scrape a hole in the iron."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='294'>Then he gave her someone for a guide, who walked near her and said nothing, but he brought her in two hours to her house. There was great joy in the castle when the Princess came back, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her. But she was very much troubled, and said, "Dear father, listen to what has befallen me! I should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if I had not come to an iron stove, to whom I have had to promise that I will go back to free him and marry him!" The old King was so frightened that he nearly fainted, for she was his only daughter. So they consulted together, and determined that the miller"s daughter, who was very beautiful, should take her place. They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she must scrape at the iron stove. She scraped for twenty-four hours, but did not make the least impression. When the day broke, a voice called from the iron stove, "It seems to me that it is day outside." Then she answered, "It seems so to me; I think I hear my father"s mill rattling."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='295'>"So you are a miller"s daughter! Then go away at once, and tell <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;daughter' adjectives='' verbs='go;come;tell' valence='5.82666666667' arousal='4.45666666667' dominance='5.3'>the King</entity>"s daughter to come."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='296'>Then she went away, and told the old King that the thing inside the iron stove would not have her, but wanted the Princess. The old King was frightened, and his daughter wept. But they had a swineherd"s daughter who was even more beautiful than the miller"s daughter, and they gave her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the Princess. Then she was taken out, and had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours, but she could make no impression. As soon as the day broke the voice from the stove called out, "It seems to be daylight outside." Then she answered, "It seems so to me too; I think I hear my father blowing his horn." "So you are a swineherd"s daughter! Go away at once, and let the King"s daughter come. And say to her that what I foretell shall come to pass, and if she does not come everything in the kingdom shall fall into ruin, and not one stone shall be left upon another." When the Princess heard this she began to cry, but it was no good; she had to keep her word. She took leave of her father, put a knife in her belt, and went to the iron stove in the wood. As soon as she reached it she began to scrape, and the iron gave way and before two hours had passed she had made a little hole. Then she peeped in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot. So she scraped away harder than ever, and made the hole so large that he could get out. Then he said, "You are mine, and I am thine; you are my bride and have set me free!" He wanted to take her with him to his kingdom, but she begged him just to let her go once more to her father; and the Prince let her go, but told her not to say more than three words to her father, then to come back again. So she went home, but alas! she said MORE THAN THREE WORDS; and immediately the iron stove vanished and went away over a mountain of glass and sharp swords. But the Prince was free, and was no longer shut up in it. Then she said good-bye to her father, and took a little money with her, and went again into the great wood to look for the iron stove; but she could not find it. She sought it for nine days, and then her hunger became so great that she did not know how she could live any longer. And when it was evening she climbed a little tree and wished that the night would not come, because she was afraid of the wild beasts. When midnight came she saw afar off a little light, and thought, "Ah! if only I could reach that!" Then she got down from the tree and went towards the light. She came to a little old house with a great deal of grass growing round, and stood in front of a little heap of wood. She thought, "Alas! what am I coming to?" and peeped through the window; but she saw nothing inside except big and little toads, and a table beautifully spread with roast meats and wine, and all the dishes and drinking-cups were of silver. Then she took heart and knocked. Then a fat toad called out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='297'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='298'>"Little green toad with leg like crook,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='301'>And a little toad came forward and let her in. When she entered they all bid her welcome, and made her sit down. They asked her how she came there and what she wanted. Then she told everything that had happened to her, and how, because she had exceeded her permission only to speak three words, the stove had disappeared with the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mountain;word;permission;stove;everything;time;valley' adjectives='long' verbs='exceed;find;search;wander;have;happen;tell;disappear;speak' valence='5.60227272727' arousal='3.90409090909' dominance='5.51818181818'>Prince</entity>; and how she had searched a very long time, and must wander over mountain and valley till she found him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='302'>Then the old toad said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='304'>"Little green toad whose leg doth twist,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='305'>Go to the corner of which you wist,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='306'>And bring to me the large old kist."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='307'>And the little toad went and brought out a great chest. Then they gave her food and drink, and led her to a beautifully made bed of silk and samite, on which she lay down and slept soundly. When the day dawned she arose, and the old toad gave her three things out of the huge chest to take with her. She would have need of them, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, three cutting swords, and a great lake. When she had passed these she would find her lover again. So she was given three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts, which she was to take great care of. She set out with these things, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery she stuck the three needles behind her feet and then in front, and so got over it, and when she was on the other side put them carefully away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='308'>Then she reached the three cutting swords, and got on her plough-wheel and rolled over them. At last she came to a great lake, and, when she had crossed that, arrived at a beautiful castle. She went in and gave herself out as a servant, a poor maid who would gladly be engaged. But she knew that the Prince whom she had freed from the iron stove in the great wood was in the castle. So she was taken on as a kitchen-maid for very small wages. Now the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='princess' adjectives='long;dead' verbs='be;marry;think' valence='5.90142857143' arousal='4.43142857143' dominance='5.08714285714'>Prince</entity> was about to marry another princess, for he thought she was dead long ago.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='309'>In the evening, when she had washed up and was ready, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. She cracked one and was going to eat the kernel, when behold! there was a beautiful royal dress inside it! When the bride heard of this, she came and begged for the dress, and wanted to buy it, saying that it was not a dress for a serving-maid. Then she said she would not sell it unless she was granted one favour--namely, to sleep by the Prince"s door. The bride granted her this, because the dress was so beautiful and she had so few like it. When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, "That stupid maid wants to sleep by your door."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>"If you are contented, I am," he said. But she gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. Then they both went to his room, but he slept so soundly that she could not wake him. The maid wept all night long, and said, "I freed you in the wild wood out of the iron stove; I have sought you, and have crossed a glassy mountain, three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found you, and will you not hear me now?" The servants outside heard how she cried the whole night, and they told their master in the morning.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='311'>When she had washed up the next evening she bit the second nut, and there was a still more beautiful dress inside. When the bride saw it she wanted to buy it also. But the maid did not want money, and asked that she should sleep again by the Prince"s door. The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-draught, and he slept so soundly that he heard nothing. But the kitchen-maid wept the whole night long, and said, "I have freed you in a wood and from an iron stove; I sought you and have crossed a glassy mountain, three sharp swords, and a great lake to find you, and now you will not hear me!" The servants outside heard how she cried the whole night, and in the morning they told their master.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='312'>And when she had washed up on the third night she bit the third nut, and there was a still more beautiful dress inside that was made of pure gold. When the bride saw it she wanted to have it, but the maid would only give it her on condition that she should sleep for the third time by the Prince"s door. But the Prince took care not to drink the sleeping-draught. When she began to weep and to say, "Dearest sweetheart, I freed you in the horrible wild wood, and from an iron stove," he jumped up and said, "You are right. You are mine, and I am thine." Though it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took the false bride"s clothes away, so that she could not follow them. When they came to the great lake they rowed across, and when they reached the three sharp swords they sat on the plough-wheel, and on the glassy mountain they stuck the three needles in. So they arrived at last at the little old house, but when they stepped inside it turned into a large castle. The toads were all freed, and were beautiful King"s children, running about for joy. There they were married, and they remained in the castle, which was much larger than that of the Princess"s father"s. But because the old man did not like being left alone, they went and fetched him. So they had two kingdoms and lived in great wealth.</paragraph>

"I will then give you a riddle," he said; "if you guess it, you shall be free and out of my power." The dragon then flew away, and they journeyed on with their little whip. They had as much money as they wanted, wore grand clothes, and made their way into the world.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='341'>Then they were all delighted and in high spirits, took out their whip, and cracked so much money that it came jumping up from the ground. When the seven years had quite gone, the Fiend came with his book, and, pointing at the signatures, said, "I will take you underground with me; you shall have a meal there. If you can tell me what you will get for your roast meat, you shall be free, and shall also keep the whip."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='350'>There was once a young Hunter who went boldly into the forest. He had a merry and light heart, and as he went whistling along there came an ugly old woman, who said to him, "Good-day, dear hunter! You are very merry and contented, but I suffer hunger and thirst, so give me a trifle." The Hunter was sorry for the poor old woman, and he felt in his pocket and gave her all he could spare. He was going on then, but the old woman stopped him and said, "Listen, dear hunter, to what I say. Because of your kind heart I will make you a present. Go on your way, and in a short time you will come to a tree on which sit nine birds who have a cloak in their claws and are quarrelling over it. Then take aim with your gun and shoot in the middle of them; they will let the cloak fall, but one of the birds will be hit and will drop down dead. Take the cloak with you; it is a wishing-cloak, and when you throw it on your shoulders you have only to wish yourself at a certain place, and in the twinkling of an eye you are there. Take the heart out of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and early every morning when you get up you will find a gold piece under your pillow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='351'>The Hunter thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself "These are splendid things she has promised me, if only they come to pass!" So he walked on about a hundred yards, and then he heard above him in the branches such a screaming and chirping that he looked up, and there he saw a heap of birds tearing a cloth with their beaks and feet, shrieking, tugging, and fighting, as if each wanted it for himself. "Well," said the Hunter, "this is wonderful! It is just as the old woman said"; and he took his gun on his shoulder, pulled the trigger, and shot into the midst of them, so that their feathers flew about. Then the flock took flight with much screaming, but one fell dead, and the cloak fluttered down. Then the Hunter did as the old woman had told him: he cut open the bird, found its heart, swallowed it, and took the cloak home with him. The next morning when he awoke he remembered the promise, and wanted to see if it had come true. But when he lifted up his pillow, there sparkled the gold piece, and the next morning he found another, and so on every time he got up. He collected a heap of gold, but at last he thought to himself, "What good is all my gold to me if I stay at home? I will travel and look a bit about me in the world." So he took leave of his parents, slung his hunting knapsack and his gun round him, and journeyed into the world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='352'>It happened that one day he went through a thick wood, and when he came to the end of it there lay in the plain before him a large castle. At one of the windows in it stood an old woman with a most beautiful maiden by her side, looking out. But the old woman was a witch, and she said to the girl, "There comes one out of the wood who has a wonderful treasure in his body which we must manage to possess ourselves of, darling daughter; we have more right to it than he. He has a bird"s heart in him, and so every morning there lies a gold piece under his pillow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='353'>She told her how they could get hold of it, and how she was to coax it from him, and at last threatened her angrily, saying, "And if you do not obey me, you shall repent it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='354'>When the Hunter came nearer he saw the maiden, and said to himself, "I have travelled so far now that I will rest, and turn into this beautiful castle; money I have in plenty." But the real reason was that he had caught sight of the lovely face.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='355'>He went into the house, and was kindly received and hospitably entertained. It was not long before he was so much in love with the witch-maiden that he thought of nothing else, and only looked in her eyes, and whatever she wanted, that he gladly did. Then the old witch said, "Now we must have the bird-heart; he will not feel when it is gone." She prepared a drink, and when it was ready she poured it in a goblet and gave it to the maiden, who had to hand it to the hunter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='356'>"Drink to me now, my dearest," she said. Then he took the goblet, and when he had swallowed the drink the bird-heart came out of his mouth. The maiden had to get hold of it secretly and then swallow it herself, for the old witch wanted to have it. Thenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow, and it lay under the maiden"s; but he was so much in love and so much bewitched that he thought of nothing except spending all his time with the maiden.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='357'>Then the old witch said, "We have the bird-heart, but we must also get the wishing-cloak from him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='358'>The maiden answered, "We will leave him that; he has already lost his wealth!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='359'>The old witch grew angry, and said, "Such a cloak is a wonderful thing, it is seldom to be had in the world, and have it I must and will." She beat the maiden, and said that if she did not obey it would go ill with her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='360'>So she did her mother"s bidding, and, standing one day by <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='distance;s;bidding;mother' adjectives='far;sad' verbs='do;be;stand;look' valence='5.46166666667' arousal='3.78833333333' dominance='5.42666666667'>the window</entity>, she looked away into the far distance as if she were very sad.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='361'>"Why are you standing there looking so sad?" asked the Hunter.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='362'>"Alas, my love," she replied, "over there lies the granite mountain where the costly precious stones grow. I have a great longing to go there, so that when I think of it I am very sad. For who can fetch them? Only the birds who fly; a man, never."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='363'>"If you have no other trouble," said the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='heart;trouble' adjectives='other' verbs='say;remove;have' valence='5.41222222222' arousal='4.00111111111' dominance='5.54888888889'>Hunter</entity>, "that one I can easily remove from your heart."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='364'>So he wrapped her round in his cloak and wished themselves to the granite mountain, and in an instant there they were, sitting on it! The precious stones sparkled so brightly on all sides that it was a pleasure to see them, and they collected the most beautiful and costly together. But now the old witch had through her caused the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;s;witch' adjectives='heavy;old' verbs='become;cause;have' valence='5.0' arousal='4.005' dominance='5.07875'>Hunter</entity>"s eyes to become heavy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='365'>He said to the maiden, "We will sit down for a little while and rest; I am so tired that I can hardly stand on my feet."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='366'>So they sat down, and he laid his head on her lap and fell asleep. As soon as he was sound asleep she unfastened the cloak from his shoulders, threw it on her own, left the granite and stones, and wished herself home again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='367'>But when the Hunter had finished his sleep and awoke, he found that his love had betrayed him and left him alone on the wild mountain. "Oh," said he, "why is faithlessness so great in the world?" and he sat down in sorrow and trouble, not knowing what to do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='368'>But the mountain belonged to fierce and huge giants, who lived on it and traded there, and he had not sat long before he saw three of them striding towards him. So he lay down as if he had fallen into a deep sleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='369'>The giants came up, and the first pushed him with his foot, and said, "What sort of an earthworm is that?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='370'>The second said, "Crush him dead."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='371'>But the third said contemptuously, "It is not worth the trouble!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='372'>Talking thus they went away. But the Hunter had listened to their talk, and as soon as they had gone he rose and climbed to the summit. When he had sat there a little while a cloud swept by, and, seizing him, carried him away. It travelled for a time in the sky, and then it sank down and hovered over a large vegetable garden surrounded by walls, so that he came safely to the ground amidst cabbages and vegetables. The Hunter then looked about him, saying, "If only I had something to eat! I am so hungry, and it will go badly with me in the future, for I see here not an apple or pear or fruit of any kind--nothing but vegetables everywhere." At last he thought, "At a pinch I can eat a salad; it does not taste particularly nice, but it will refresh me." So he looked about for a good head and ate it, but no sooner had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange, and found himself wonderfully changed. Four legs began to grow on him, a thick head, and two long ears, and he saw with horror that he had changed into a donkey. But as he was still very hungry and this juicy salad tasted very good to his present nature, he went on eating with a still greater appetite. At last he got hold of another kind of cabbage, but scarcely had swallowed it when he felt another change, and he once more regained his human form.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='373'>The Hunter now lay down and slept off his weariness. When he awoke the next morning he broke off a head of the bad and a head of the good cabbage, thinking, "This will help me to regain my own, and to punish faithlessness." Then he put the heads in his pockets, climbed the wall, and started off to seek the castle of his love. When he had wandered about for a couple of days he found it quite easily. He then browned his face quickly, so that his own mother would not have known him, and went into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lodging;mother;face' adjectives='own' verbs='go;brown;know;have;beg' valence='5.946' arousal='4.244' dominance='5.401'>the castle</entity>, where he begged for a lodging.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='376'>He answered, "I am a messenger of the King, and have been sent to seek the finest salad that grows under the sun.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='377'>When the old witch heard of the fine salad she wanted to eat it, and said, "Dear countryman, just let me taste the wonderful salad."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='378'>"Why not?" he answered; "I have brought two heads with me, and will give you one."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='379'>So saying, he opened his sack and gave her the bad one. The witch suspected no evil, and her mouth watered to taste the new dish, so that she went into the kitchen to prepare it herself. When it was ready she could not wait till it was served at the table, but she immediately took a couple of leaves and put them in her mouth. No sooner, however, had she swallowed them than she lost human form, and ran into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shape;donkey;form' adjectives='human' verbs='swallow;run;have;lose' valence='5.469' arousal='4.005' dominance='5.392'>the courtyard</entity> in the shape of a donkey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>Now the servant came into the kitchen, and when she saw the salad standing there ready cooked she was about to carry it up, but on the way, according to her old habit, she tasted it and ate a couple of leaves.

In the meantime, the messenger was sitting with the lovely maiden, and as no one came with the salad, and she wanted very much to taste it, she said, "I don"t know where the salad is."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>In a part of the world whose name I forget lived once upon a time two kings, called Peridor and Diamantino. They were cousins as well as neighbours, and both were under the protection of the fairies; though it is only fair to say that the fairies did not love them half so well as their wives did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='399'>Now it often happens that as princes can generally manage to get their own way it is harder for them to be good than it is for common people. So it was with Peridor and Diamantino; but of the two, the fairies declared that Diamantino was much the worst; indeed, he behaved so badly to his wife Aglantino, that the fairies would not allow him to live any longer; and he died, leaving behind him a little daughter. As she was an only child, of course this little girl was the heiress of the kingdom, but, being still only a baby, her mother, the widow of Diamantino, was proclaimed regent. The Queen-dowager was wise and good, and tried her best to make her people happy. The only thing she had to vex her was the absence of her daughter; for the fairies, for reasons of their own, determined to bring up the little <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;absence;thing;reason;fairy;serpentine' adjectives='only;own;little' verbs='be;determine;vex;have;bring' valence='6.03545454545' arousal='4.24' dominance='5.65'>Princess</entity> Serpentine among themselves.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='400'>As to the other King, he was really fond of his wife, Queen Constance, but he often grieved her by his thoughtless ways, and in order to punish him for his carelessness, the fairies caused her to die quite suddenly. When she was gone the King felt how much he had loved her, and his grief was so great (though he never neglected his duties) that his subjects called him Peridor the Sorrowful. It seems hardly possible that any man should live like <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grief;depth;fairy;man' adjectives='such;possible' verbs='be;plunge;die;live;have;seem' valence='5.64294117647' arousal='4.23176470588' dominance='5.31705882353'>Peridor</entity> for fifteen years plunged in such depth of grief, and most likely he would have died too if it had not been for the fairies.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='401'>The one comfort the poor King had was his son, Prince Saphir, who was only three years old at the time of his mother"s death, and great care was given to his education.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='402'>It was about this time that the fairies suddenly took fright lest his love for his father should interfere with the plans they had made for the young prince. So, to prevent this, they placed in a pretty little room of which Saphir was very fond a little mirror in a black frame, such as were often brought from Venice. The Prince did not notice for some days that there was anything new in the room, but at last he perceived it, and went up to look at it more closely. What was his surprise to see reflected in the mirror, not his own face, but that of a young girl as lovely as the morning! And, better still, every movement of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='glass;childhood;movement' adjectives='better;wonderful' verbs='reflect;be;grow' valence='6.47875' arousal='3.75625' dominance='5.8575'>the girl</entity>, just growing out of childhood, was also reflected in the wonderful glass.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='403'>As might have been expected, the young Prince lost his heart completely to the beautiful image, and it was impossible to get him out of the room, so busy was he in watching the lovely unknown. Certainly it was very delightful to be able to see her whom he loved at any moment he chose, but his spirits sometimes sank when he wondered what was to be the end of this adventure.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='404'>The magic mirror had been for about a year in the Prince"s possession, when one day a new subject of disquiet seized upon him. As usual, he was engaged in looking at the girl, when suddenly he thought he saw a second mirror reflected in the first, exactly like his own, and with the same power. And in this he was perfectly right. The young girl had only possessed it for a short time, and neglected all her duties for the sake of the mirror. Now it was not difficult for Saphir to guess the reason of the change in her, nor why the new mirror was consulted so often; but try as he would he could never see the face of the person who was reflected in it, for the young girl"s figure always came between. All he knew was that the face was that of a man, and this was quite enough to make him madly jealous. This was the doing of the fairies, and we must suppose that they had their reasons for acting as they did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='405'>When these things happened Saphir was about eighteen years old, and fifteen years had passed away since the death of his mother. King Peridor had grown more and more unhappy as time went on, and at last he fell so ill that it seemed as if his days were numbered. He was so much beloved by his subjects that this sad news was heard with despair by the nation, and more than all by the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='news;nation;despair;subject' adjectives='more;much;beloved;sad' verbs='be;hear' valence='5.386' arousal='4.226' dominance='5.243'>Prince</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='406'>During his whole illness the King never spoke of anything but the Queen, his sorrow at having grieved her, and his hope of one day seeing her again. All the doctors and all the water-cures in the kingdom had been tried, and nothing would do him any good. At last he persuaded them to let him lie quietly in his room, where no one came to trouble him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='407'>Perhaps the worst pain he had to bear was a sort of weight on his chest, which made it very hard for him to breathe. So he commanded his servants to leave the windows open in order that he might get more air. One day, when he had been left alone for a few minutes, a bird with brilliant plumage came and fluttered round the window, and finally rested on the sill. His feathers were sky-blue and gold, his feet and his beak of such glittering rubies that no one could bear to look at them, his eyes made the brightest diamonds look dull, and on his head he wore a crown. I cannot tell you what the crown was made of, but I am quite certain that it was still more splendid than all the rest. As to his voice I can say nothing about that, for the bird never sang at all. In fact, he did nothing but gaze steadily at the King, and as he gazed, the King felt his strength come back to him. In a little while the bird flew into the room, still with his eyes fixed on the King, and at every glance the strength of the sick man became greater, till he was once more as well as he used to be before the Queen died. Filled with joy at his cure, he tried to seize the bird to whom he owed it all, but, swifter than a swallow, it managed to avoid him. In vain he described the bird to his attendants, who rushed at his first call; in vain they sought the wonderful creature both on horse and foot, and summoned the fowlers to their aid: the bird could nowhere be found. The love the people bore <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='town;woman;eye;people;twinkling;field;child;love;reward;man' adjectives='large;strong;empty' verbs='flee;be;promise;have;bear' valence='5.99761904762' arousal='4.24523809524' dominance='5.43619047619'>King Peridor</entity> was so strong, and the reward he promised was so large, that in the twinkling of an eye every man, woman, and child had fled into the fields, and the towns were quite empty.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='408'>All this bustle, however, ended in nothing but confusion, and, what was worse, the King soon fell back into the same condition as he was in before. Prince Saphir, who loved his father very dearly, was so unhappy at this that he persuaded himself that he might succeed where the others had failed, and at once prepared himself for a more distant search. In spite of the opposition he met with, he rode away, followed by his household, trusting to chance to help him. He had formed no plan, and there was no reason that he should choose one path more than another. His only idea was to make straight for those spots which were the favourite haunts of birds. But in vain he examined all the hedges and all the thickets; in vain he questioned everyone he met along the road. The more he sought the less he found.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='409'>At last he came to one of the largest forests in all the world, composed entirely of cedars. But in spite of the deep shadows cast by the wide-spreading branches of the trees, the grass underneath was soft and green, and covered with the rarest flowers. It seemed to Saphir that this was exactly the place where the birds would choose to live, and he determined not to quit the wood until he had examined it from end to end. And he did more. He ordered some nets to be prepared and painted of the same colours as the bird"s plumage, thinking that we are all easily caught by what is like ourselves. In this he had to help him not only the fowlers by profession, but also his attendants, who excelled in this art. For a man is not a courtier unless he can do everything.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='410'>After searching as usual for nearly a whole day Prince Saphir began to feel overcome with thirst. He was too tired to go any farther, when happily he discovered a little way off a bubbling fountain of the clearest water. Being an experienced traveller, he drew from his pocket a little cup (without which no one should ever take a journey), and was just about to dip it in the water, when a lovely little green frog, much prettier than frogs generally are, jumped into the cup. Far from admiring its beauty, Saphir shook it impatiently off; but it was no good, for quick as lightning the frog jumped back again. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;thirst;world;bird;friend;creature' adjectives='beautiful;little' verbs='be;rage;quench;fix;say;have;shake;seek;listen' valence='5.78541666667' arousal='4.24916666667' dominance='5.67083333333'>Saphir</entity>, who was raging with thirst, was just about to shake it off anew, when the little creature fixed upon him the most beautiful eyes in the world, and said, "I am a friend of the bird you are seeking, and when you have quenched your thirst listen to me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='411'>So the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='little;frog;green;command;grass;fill' adjectives='' verbs='drink;lay;rest' valence='6.041' arousal='4.006' dominance='5.834'>Prince</entity> drank his fill, and then, by the command of the Little Green Frog, he lay down on the grass to rest himself.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='412'>"Now," she began, "be sure you do exactly in every respect what I tell you. First you must call together your attendants, and order them to remain in a little hamlet close by until you want them. Then go, quite alone, down a road that you will find on your right hand, looking southwards. This road is planted all the way with cedars of Lebanon; and after going down it a long way you will come at last to a magnificent castle. And now," she went on, "attend carefully to what I am going to say. Take this tiny grain of sand, and put it into the ground as close as you can to the gate of the castle. It has the virtue both of opening the gate and also of sending to sleep all the inhabitants. Then go at once to the stable, and pay no heed to anything except what I tell you. Choose the handsomest of all the horses, leap quickly on its back, and come to me as fast as you can.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='413'>The Prince, who felt more hopeful than he had done since he left home, did precisely as he had been ordered. He left his attendants in the hamlet, found the road the frog had described to him, and followed it all alone, and at last he arrived at the gate of the castle, which was even more splendid than he had expected, for it was built of crystal, and all its ornaments were of massive gold. However, he had no thoughts to spare for its beauty, and quickly buried his grain of sand in the earth. In one instant the gates flew open, and all the dwellers inside fell sound asleep. Saphir flew straight to the stable, and already had his hand on the finest horse it contained, when his eye was caught by a suit of magnificent harness hanging up close by. It occurred to him directly that the harness belonged to the horse, and without ever thinking of harm (for indeed he who steals a horse can hardly be blamed for taking his saddle), he hastily placed it on the animal"s back. Suddenly the people in the castle became broad awake, and rushed to the stable. They flung themselves on the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lord;face;conduct;question;excuse' adjectives='further;fancy;lame' verbs='depart;seize;fling;drag;let;take;find' valence='5.31473684211' arousal='4.19894736842' dominance='5.43210526316'>Prince</entity>, seized him, and dragged him before their lord; but, luckily for the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='lord;face;conduct;question;excuse' adjectives='further;fancy;lame' verbs='depart;seize;fling;drag;let;take;find' valence='5.31473684211' arousal='4.19894736842' dominance='5.43210526316'>Prince</entity>, who could only find very lame excuses for his conduct, the lord of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lord;face;conduct;question;excuse' adjectives='further;fancy;lame' verbs='depart;seize;fling;drag;let;take;find' valence='5.31473684211' arousal='4.19894736842' dominance='5.43210526316'>the castle</entity> took a fancy to his face, and let him depart without further questions.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='415'>"Whom do you take me for?" she exclaimed angrily. "Do you really believe that it was just for the pleasure of talking that I gave you the advice you have neglected so abominably?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='416'>But the Prince was so deeply grieved, and apologised so very humbly, that after some time the heart of the good little Frog was softened, and she gave him another tiny little grain, but instead of being sand it was now a grain of gold. She directed him to do just as he had done before, with only this difference, that instead of going to the stable which had been the ruin of his hopes, he was to enter right into the castle itself, and to glide as fast as he could down the passages till he came to a room filled with perfume, where he would find a beautiful maiden asleep on a bed. He was to wake the maiden instantly and carry her off, and to be sure not to pay any heed to whatever resistance she might make.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='417'>The Prince obeyed the Frog"s orders one by one, and all went well for this second time also. The gate opened, the inhabitants fell sound asleep, and he walked down the passage till he found the girl on her bed, exactly as he had been told he would. He woke her, and begged her firmly, but politely, to follow him quickly. After a little persuasion the maiden consented, but only on condition that she was allowed first to put on her dress. This sounded so reasonable and natural that it did not enter the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;request' adjectives='natural;reasonable' verbs='sound;do;head;refuse;enter' valence='5.678' arousal='4.215' dominance='5.48'>Prince</entity>"s head to refuse her request.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='418'>But the maiden"s hand had hardly touched the dress when the palace suddenly awoke from its sleep, and the Prince was seized and bound. He was so vexed with his own folly, and so taken aback at the disaster, that he did not attempt to explain his conduct, and things would have gone badly with him if his friends the fairies had not softened the hearts of his captors, so that they once more allowed him to leave quietly. However, what troubled him most was the idea of having to meet the Frog who had been his benefactress. How was he ever to appear before her with this tale? Still, after a long struggle with himself, he made up his mind that there was nothing else to be done, and that he deserved whatever she might say to him. And she said a great deal, for she had worked herself into a terrible passion; but the Prince humbly implored her pardon, and ventured to point out that it would have been very hard to refuse the young lady"s reasonable request. "You must learn to do as you are told," was all the Frog would reply.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='419'>But poor Saphir was so unhappy, and begged so hard for forgiveness, that at last the Frog"s anger gave way, and she held up to him a tiny diamond stone. "Go back," she said, "to the castle, and bury this little diamond close to the door. But be careful not to return to the stable or to the bedroom; they have proved too fatal to you. Walk straight to the garden and enter through a portico, into a small green wood, in the midst of which is a tree with a trunk of gold and leaves of emeralds. Perched on this tree you will see the beautiful bird you have been seeking so long. You must cut the branch on which it is sitting, and bring it back to me without delay. But I warn you solemnly that if you disobey my directions, as you have done twice before, you have nothing more to expect either of me or anyone else."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='420'>With these words she jumped into the water, and the Prince, who had taken her threats much to heart, took his departure, firmly resolved not to deserve them. He found it all just as he had been told: the portico, the wood, the magnificent tree, and the beautiful bird, which was sleeping soundly on one of the branches. He speedily lopped off the branch, and though he noticed a splendid golden cage hanging close by, which would have been very useful for the bird to travel in, he left it alone, and came back to the fountain, holding his breath and walking on tip-toe all the way, for fear lest he should awake his prize. But what was his surprise, when instead of finding <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='standing;maiden;palace;taste;mind;spot;doorway;way;place;sight;surprise' adjectives='rustic;little;best;charming' verbs='be;give;leave;see;build;have;seem;find' valence='6.01083333333' arousal='4.09125' dominance='5.61833333333'>the fountain</entity> in the spot where he had left it, he saw in its place a little rustic palace built in the best taste, and standing in the doorway a charming maiden, at whose sight his mind seemed to give way.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='421'>"What! Madam!" he cried, hardly knowing what he said. "What! Is it you?"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>"Ah, my lord," she replied, with rather an awkward air, "as to the Frog, she stands before you. Let me tell you my story; it is not a long one. I know neither my country nor my parents, and the only thing I can say for certain is that I am called Serpentine. The fairies, who have taken care of me ever since I was born, wished me to be in ignorance as to my family, but they have looked after my education, and have bestowed on me endless kindness. I have always lived in seclusion, and for the last two years I have wished for nothing better. I had a mirror"--here shyness and embarrassment choked her words--but regaining her self-control, she added, "You know that fairies insist on being obeyed without questioning. It was they who changed the little house you saw before you into the fountain for which you are now asking, and, having turned me into a frog, they ordered me to say to the first person who came to the fountain exactly what I repeated to you. But, my lord, when you stood before me, it was agony to my heart, filled as it was with thoughts of you, to appear to your eyes under so monstrous a form. However, there was no help for it, and, painful as it was, I had to submit. I desired your success with all my soul, not only for your own sake, but also for my own, because I could not get back my proper shape till you had become master of the beautiful bird, though I am quite ignorant as to your reason for seeking it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='428'>In vain Saphir declared that love made them equal; Serpentine would only reply: "I love you too much to allow you to marry beneath your rank.

If I do not find from the fairies that my birth is worthy of you, then, whatever be my feelings, I will never accept your hand."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='429'>The conversation was at this point, and bid fair to last some time longer, when one of the fairies appeared in her ivory car, accompanied by a beautiful woman past her early youth. At this moment the bird suddenly awakened, and, flying on to Saphir"s shoulder (which it never afterwards left), began fondling him as well as a bird can do. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='diamantino;widow;aunt;aglantine;conduct' adjectives='agreeable;other;satisfied' verbs='be;make;bring;explain;have;tell;present' valence='5.97470588235' arousal='3.82294117647' dominance='5.78470588235'>The fairy</entity> told Serpentine that she was quite satisfied with her conduct, and made herself very agreeable to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='diamantino;widow;aunt;aglantine;conduct' adjectives='agreeable;other;satisfied' verbs='be;make;bring;explain;have;tell;present' valence='5.97470588235' arousal='3.82294117647' dominance='5.78470588235'>Saphir</entity>, whom she presented to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='diamantino;widow;aunt;aglantine;conduct' adjectives='agreeable;other;satisfied' verbs='be;make;bring;explain;have;tell;present' valence='5.97470588235' arousal='3.82294117647' dominance='5.78470588235'>the lady</entity> she had brought with her, explaining that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='diamantino;widow;aunt;aglantine;conduct' adjectives='agreeable;other;satisfied' verbs='be;make;bring;explain;have;tell;present' valence='5.97470588235' arousal='3.82294117647' dominance='5.78470588235'>the lady</entity> was no other than his Aunt Aglantine, widow of Diamantino.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='430'>Then they all fell into each other"s arms, till the fairy mounted her chariot, placed Aglantine by her side, and Saphir and Serpentine on the front seat. She also sent a message to the Prince"s attendants that they might travel slowly back to the Court of King Peridor, and that the beautiful bird had really been found. This matter being comfortably arranged, she started off her chariot. But in spite of the swiftness with which they flew through the air, the time passed even quicker for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time;swiftness;spite;air' adjectives='much;quicker' verbs='fly;think;have;pass' valence='6.10666666667' arousal='3.86833333333' dominance='5.39333333333'>Saphir</entity> and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='time;swiftness;spite;air' adjectives='much;quicker' verbs='fly;think;have;pass' valence='6.10666666667' arousal='3.86833333333' dominance='5.39333333333'>Serpentine</entity>, who had so much to think about.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='431'>They were still quite confused with the pleasure of seeing each other, when the chariot arrived at King Peridor"s palace. He had had himself carried to a room on the roof, where his nurses thought that he would die at any moment. Directly the chariot drew within sight of the castle the beautiful bird took flight, and, making straight for the dying King, at once cured him of his sickness. Then she resumed her natural shape, and he found that the bird was no other than the Queen Constance, whom he had long believed to be dead. Peridor was rejoiced to embrace his wife and his son once more, and with the help of the fairies began to make preparations for the marriage of Saphir and Serpentine, who turned out to be the daughter of Aglantine and Diamantino, and as much a princess as he was a prince.

They went straight on night and day, until they came to an island which was covered with large trees, and under every tree lay a lion. As soon as the King had landed his men, the lions all rose up together and tried to devour them. After a long battle they managed to overcome the wild beasts, but the greater number of the men were killed. Those who remained alive now went on through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='world;plant;side;garden' adjectives='beautiful;other;alive' verbs='go;remain;flourish;find' valence='6.38538461538' arousal='4.36153846154' dominance='5.96076923077'>the forest</entity> and found on the other side of it a beautiful garden, in which all the plants of the world flourished together.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='436'>There were also in the garden three springs: the first flowed with silver, the second with gold, and the third with pearls. The men unbuckled their knapsacks and filled them with those precious things. In the middle of the garden they found a large lake, and when they reached the edge of it the Lake began to speak, and said to them, "What men are you, and what brings you here? Are you come to visit our king?" But they were too much frightened to answer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='437'>Then the Lake said, "You do well to be afraid, for it is at your peril that you are come hither. Our king, who has seven heads, is now asleep, but in a few minutes he will wake up and come to me to take his bath! Woe to anyone who meets him in the garden, for it is impossible to escape from him. This is what you must do if you wish to save your lives. Take off your clothes and spread them on the path which leads from here to the castle. The King will then glide over something soft, which he likes very much, and he will be so pleased with that that he will not devour you. He will give you some punishment, but then he will let you go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='438'>The men did as the Lake advised them, and waited for a time. At noon the earth began to quake, and opened in many places, and out of the openings appeared lions, tigers, and other wild beasts, which surrounded the castle, and thousands and thousands of beasts came out of the castle following their king, the Seven-headed Serpent. The Serpent glided over the clothes which were spread for him, came to the Lake, and asked it who had strewed those soft things on the path? The Lake answered that it had been done by people who had come to do him homage. The King commanded that the men should be brought before him. They came humbly on their knees, and in a few words told him their story. Then he spoke to them with a mighty and terrible voice, and said, "Because you have dared to come here, I lay upon you the punishment. Every year you must bring me from among your people twelve youths and twelve maidens, that I may devour them. If you do not do this, I will destroy your whole nation."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='439'>Then he desired one of his beasts to show the men the way out of the garden, and dismissed them. They then left the island and went back to their own country, where they related what had happened to them. Soon the time came round when the king of the beasts would expect the youths and maidens to be brought to him. The King therefore issued a proclamation inviting twelve youths and twelve maidens to offer themselves up to save their country; and immediately many young people, far more than enough, hastened to do so. A new ship was built, and set with black sails, and in it the youths and maidens who were appointed for the king of the beasts embarked and set out for his country. When they arrived there they went at once to the Lake, and this time the lions did not stir, nor did the springs flow, and neither did the Lake speak. So they waited then, and it was not long before the earth quaked even more terribly than the first time. The Seven-headed Serpent came without his train of beasts, saw his prey waiting for him, and devoured it at one mouthful. Then the ship"s crew returned home, and the same thing happened yearly until many years had passed.</paragraph>

After a time the Queen had a little boy, and the mare also had a male foal. The boy and the foal grew up together and loved each other like brothers. In course of time the King died, and so did the Queen, and their son, who was now nineteen years old, was left alone. One day, when he and his horse were talking together, the Horse said to him, "Listen to me, for I love you and wish for your good and that of the country.

I will tell you what you have to do. Load your horse with cotton, and go by a secret passage which I will show you, which is hidden from the wild beasts, to the Serpent"s palace. You will find the King asleep upon his bed, which is all hung round with bells, and over his bed you will see a sword hanging. With this sword only it is possible to kill the Serpent, because even if its blade breaks a new one will grow again for every head the monster has. Thus you will be able to cut off all his seven heads. And this you must also do in order to deceive the King: you must slip into his bed-chamber very softly, and stop up all the bells which are round his bed with cotton. Then take down the sword gently, and quickly give the monster a blow on his tail with it. This will make him waken up, and if he catches sight of you he will seize you. But you must quickly cut off his first head, and then wait till the next one comes up. Then strike it off also, and so go on till you have cut off all his seven heads."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='448'>The old Abbess then gave the Prince her blessing, and he set out upon his enterprise, arrived at the Serpent"s castle by following the secret passage which she had shown him, and by carefully attending to all her directions he happily succeeded in killing the monster. As soon as the wild beasts heard of their king"s death, they all hastened to the castle, but the youth had long since mounted his horse and was already far out of their reach. They pursued him as fast as they could, but they found it impossible to overtake him, and he reached home in safety. Thus he freed his country from this terrible oppression.</paragraph>

But when the sun was once more high in the heavens, Ferko felt the blazing heat scorch him, and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs. He climbed to the top of a hill and lay down in the grass, and as he thought under the shadow of a big tree. But it was no tree he leant against, but a gallows on which two ravens were seated. The one was saying to the other as the weary youth lay down, "Is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighbourhood?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>"I should just think there was," replied the other; "many things that don"t exist anywhere else in the world.

On the spot the queen bee was cured, and turning to Ferko she said, "I am most grateful for your kindness, and shall reward you some day." And with these words she flew away humming, gaily.</paragraph>

The sun sank to rest and night came on, when a little mouse started out of the grass at Ferko"s feet, and said to him, "I"m delighted to see you, my kind benefactor; but why are you looking so sad?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='514'>There was once upon a time a poor boy who had neither father nor mother. In order to gain a living he looked after the sheep of a great Lord. Day and night he spent out in the open fields, and only when it was very wet and stormy did he take refuge in a little hut on the edge of a big forest. Now one night, when he was sitting on the grass beside his flocks, he heard not very far from him the sound as of some one crying. He rose up and followed the direction of the noise. To his dismay and astonishment he found a Giant lying at the entrance of the wood; he was about to run off as fast as his legs could carry him, when the Giant called out: "Don"t be afraid, I won"t harm you. On the contrary, I will reward you handsomely if you will bind up my foot. I hurt it when I was trying to root up an oak-tree." The Herd-boy took off his shirt, and bound up the Giant"s wounded foot with it. Then the Giant rose up and said, "Now come and I will reward you. We are going to celebrate a marriage to-day, and I promise you we shall have plenty of fun. Come and enjoy yourself, but in order that my brothers mayn"t see you, put this band round your waist and then you"ll be invisible." With these words he handed the Herd-boy a belt, and walking on in front he led him to a fountain where hundreds of Giants and Giantesses were assembled preparing to hold a wedding. They danced and played different games till midnight; then one of the Giants tore up a plant by its roots, and all the Giants and Giantesses made themselves so thin that they disappeared into the earth through the hole made by the uprooting of the plant. The wounded Giant remained behind to the last and called out, "Herd-boy, where are you?" "Here I am, close to you," was the reply. "Touch me," said the Giant, "so that you too may come with us under ground." The Herd-boy did as he was told, and before he could have believed it possible he found himself in a big hall, where even the walls were made of pure gold. Then to his astonishment he saw that the hall was furnished with the tables and chairs that belonged to his master. In a few minutes the company began to eat and drink.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='515'>The banquet was a very gorgeous one, and the poor youth fell to and ate and drank lustily. When he had eaten and drunk as much as he could he thought to himself, "Why shouldn"t I put a loaf of bread in my pocket? I shall be glad of it to-morrow." So he seized a loaf when no one was looking and stowed it away under his tunic. No sooner had he done so than the wounded Giant limped up to him and whispered softly, "Herd-boy, where are you?" "Here I am," replied the youth. "Then hold on to me," said the Giant, "so that I may lead you up above again." So the Herd-boy held on to the Giant, and in a few moments he found himself on the earth once more, but the Giant had vanished. The Herd-boy returned to his sheep, and took off the invisible belt which he hid carefully in his bag.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='516'>The next morning the lad felt hungry, and thought he would cut off a piece of the loaf he had carried away from the Giants" wedding feast, and eat it. But although he tried with all his might, he couldn"t cut off the smallest piece. Then in despair he bit the loaf, and what was his astonishment when a piece of gold fell out of his mouth and rolled at his feet. He bit the bread a second and third time, and each time a piece of gold fell out of his mouth; but the bread remained untouched. The Herd-boy was very much delighted over his stroke of good fortune, and, hiding the magic loaf in his bag, he hurried off to the nearest village to buy himself something to eat, and then returned to his sheep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='517'>Now the Lord whose sheep the Herd-boy looked after had a very lovely daughter, who always smiled and nodded to the youth when she walked with her father in his fields. For a long time the Herd-boy had made up his mind to prepare a surprise for this beautiful creature on her birthday. So when the day approached he put on his invisible belt, took a sack of gold pieces with him, and slipping into her room in the middle of the night, he placed the bag of gold beside her bed and returned to his sheep. The girl"s joy was great, and so was her parents" next day when they found the sack full of gold pieces. The Herd-boy was so pleased to think what pleasure he had given that the next night he placed another bag of gold beside the girl"s bed. And this he continued to do for seven nights, and the girl and her parents made up their minds that it must be a good Fairy who brought the gold every night. But one night they determined to watch, and see from their hiding place who the bringer of the sack of gold really was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='518'>On the eighth night a fearful storm of wind and rain came on while the Herd-boy was on his way to bring the beautiful girl another bag of gold. Then for the first time he noticed, just as he reached his master"s house, that he had forgotten the belt which made him invisible. He didn"t like the idea of going back to his hut in the wind and wet, so he just stepped as he was into the girl"s room, laid the sack of gold beside her, and was turning to leave the room, when his master confronted him and said, "You young rogue, so you were going to steal the gold that a good Fairy brings every night, were you?" The Herd-boy was so taken aback by his words, that he stood trembling before him, and did not dare to explain his presence. Then his master spoke. "As you have hitherto always behaved well in my service I will not send you to prison; but leave your place instantly and never let me see your face again." So the Herd-boy went back to his hut, and taking his loaf and belt with him, he went to the nearest town. There he bought himself some fine clothes, and a beautiful coach with four horses, hired two servants, and drove back to his master. You may imagine how astonished he was to see his Herd-boy returning to him in this manner! Then the youth told him of the piece of good luck that had befallen him, and asked him for the hand of his beautiful daughter. This was readily granted, and the two lived in peace and happiness to the end of their lives.</paragraph>

The eldest, who was quick and lively, with a vivid imagination, she made Lord of Fire, which was in her opinion the noblest of all the elements. To the second son, whose wisdom and prudence made amends for his being rather dull, she gave the government of the earth. The third was wild and savage, and of monstrous stature; and the Fairy, his mother, who was ashamed of his defects, hoped to hide them by creating him King of the Seas.

So she thought the best thing she could do was to bring him up with a horror of women; and, to her great delight, she saw this dislike only increased as he grew older. From his earliest childhood he heard nothing but stories of princes who had fallen into all sorts of troubles through love; and she drew such terrible pictures of poor little Cupid that the young man had no difficulty in believing that he was the root of all evil.</paragraph>

In the midst of this forest she built a palace which had not its equal for beauty in the whole world, and then she considered that she had done enough to make any prince happy.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='537'>He travelled many weary days without hearing a single word of the lost Princess, till one morning, as he was walking through a thick forest, he suddenly perceived a magnificent palace standing at the end of a pine avenue, and his heart bounded to think that he might be gazing on Rosalie"s prison. He hastened his steps, and quickly arrived at the gate of the palace, which was formed of a single agate. The gate swung open to let him through, and he next passed successively three courts, surrounded by deep ditches filled with running water, with birds of brilliant plumage flying about the banks. Everything around was rare and beautiful, but the Prince scarcely raised his eyes to all these wonders. He thought only of the Princess and where he should find her, but in vain he opened every door and searched in every corner; he neither saw Rosalie nor anyone else. At last there was no place left for him to search but a little wood, which contained in the centre a sort of hall built entirely of orange-trees, with four small rooms opening out of the corners. Three of these were empty except for statues and wonderful things, but in the fourth the Invisible Prince caught sight of Rosalie. His joy at beholding her again was, however, somewhat lessened by seeing that the Prince of the Air was kneeling at her feet, and pleading his own cause. But it was in vain that he implored her to listen; she only shook her head. "No," was all she would say; "you snatched me from my father whom I loved, and all the splendour in the world can never console me. Go! I can never feel anything towards you but hate and contempt." With these words she turned away and entered her own apartments.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='538'>Unknown to herself the Invisible Prince had followed her, but fearing to be discovered by the Princess in the presence of others, he made up his mind to wait quietly till dark; and employed the long hours in writing a poem to the Princess, which he laid on the bed beside her.

Thus encouraged, she told him all her story, and of the arrival of a young stranger in her father"s palace, whose looks had so charmed her that since that day she had thought of no one else.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='540'>When they had got over the first rapture of meeting they began to make plans to escape from the power of the Prince of the Air. But this did not prove easy, for the magic stone would only serve for one person at a time, and in order to save Rosalie the Prince of the Golden Isle would have to expose himself to the fury of his enemy. But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='hear' valence='6.295' arousal='3.715' dominance='6.325'>Rosalie</entity> would not hear of this.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='541'>"No, Prince," she said; "since you are here this island no longer feels a prison. Besides, you are under the protection of a Fairy, who always visits your father"s court at this season.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='542'>The Prince of the Air returned a few days later from his mother"s palace, but the Invisible Prince had already set out. He had, however, entirely forgotten the road by which he had come, and lost himself for so long in the forest, that when at last he reached home the Fairy had already left, and, in spite of all his grief, there was nothing for it but to wait till the Fairy"s next visit, and allow Rosalie to suffer three months longer. This thought drove him to despair, and he had almost made up his mind to return to the place of her captivity, when one day, as he was strolling along an alley in the woods, he saw a huge oak open its trunk, and out of it step two Princes in earnest conversation. As our hero had the magic stone in his mouth they imagined themselves alone, and did not lower their voices.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='543'>"What!" said one, "are you always going to allow yourself to be tormented by a passion which can never end happily, and in your whole kingdom can you find nothing else to satisfy you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='544'>"What is the use," replied the other, "of being Prince of the Gnomes, and having a mother who is queen over all the four elements, if I cannot win the love of the Princess Argentine? From the moment that I first saw her, sitting in the forest surrounded by flowers, I have never ceased to think of her night and day, and, although I love her, I am quite convinced that she will never care for me. You know that I have in my palace the cabinets of the years. In the first, great mirrors reflect the past; in the second, we contemplate the present; in the third, the future can be read. It was here that I fled after I had gazed on the Princess Argentine, but instead of love I only saw scorn and contempt. Think how great must be my devotion, when, in spite of my fate, I still love on!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='545'>Now the Prince of the Golden Isle was enchanted with this conversation, for the Princess Argentine was his sister, and he hoped, by means of her influence over the Prince of the Gnomes, to obtain from his brother the release of Rosalie. So he joyfully returned to his father"s palace, where he found his friend the Fairy, who at once presented him with a magic pebble like his own. As may be imagined, he lost no time in setting out to deliver Rosalie, and travelled so fast that he soon arrived at the forest, in the midst of which she lay a captive. But though he found the palace he did not find Rosalie. He hunted high and low, but there was no sign of her, and his despair was so great that he was ready, a thousand times over, to take his own life. At last he remembered the conversation of the two Princes about the cabinets of the years, and that if he could manage to reach the oak tree, he would be certain to discover what had become of Rosalie. Happily, he soon found out the secret of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='genie;secret' adjectives='unfortunate' verbs='leave;sit;enter;surround;reflect;see;mirror;weep;find' valence='5.45944444444' arousal='3.85555555556' dominance='5.57222222222'>the passage</entity> and entered <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='genie;secret' adjectives='unfortunate' verbs='leave;sit;enter;surround;reflect;see;mirror;weep;find' valence='5.45944444444' arousal='3.85555555556' dominance='5.57222222222'>the cabinet</entity> of the present, where he saw reflected in the mirrors the unfortunate <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='genie;secret' adjectives='unfortunate' verbs='leave;sit;enter;surround;reflect;see;mirror;weep;find' valence='5.45944444444' arousal='3.85555555556' dominance='5.57222222222'>Rosalie</entity> sitting on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='genie;secret' adjectives='unfortunate' verbs='leave;sit;enter;surround;reflect;see;mirror;weep;find' valence='5.45944444444' arousal='3.85555555556' dominance='5.57222222222'>the floor</entity> weeping bitterly, and surrounded with genii, who never left her night or day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='546'>This sight only increased the misery of the Prince, for he did not know where the castle was, nor how to set about finding it. However, he resolved to seek the whole world through till he came to the right place. He began by setting sail in a favourable wind, but his bad luck followed him even on the sea. He had scarcely lost sight of the land when a violent storm arose, and after several hours of beating about, the vessel was driven on to some rocks, on which it dashed itself to bits. The Prince was fortunate enough to be able to lay hold of a floating spar, and contrived to keep himself afloat; and, after a long struggle with the winds and waves, he was cast upon a strange island. But what was his surprise, on reaching the shore, to hear sounds of the most heartrending distress, mingled with the sweetest songs which had ever charmed him! His curiosity was instantly roused, and he advanced cautiously till he saw two huge dragons guarding the gate of a wood. They were terrible indeed to look upon. Their bodies were covered with glittering scales; their curly tails extended far over the land; flames darted from their mouths and noses, and their eyes would have made the bravest shudder; but as the Prince was invisible and they did not see him, he slipped past them into the wood. He found himself at once in a labyrinth, and wandered about for a long time without meeting anyone; in fact, the only sight he saw was a circle of human hands, sticking out of the ground above the wrist, each with a bracelet of gold, on which a name was written. The farther he advanced in the labyrinth the more curious he became, till he was stopped by two corpses lying in the midst of a cypress alley, each with a scarlet cord round his neck and a bracelet on his arm on which were engraved their own names, and those of two Princesses.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='547'>The invisible Prince recognised these dead men as Kings of two large islands near his own home, but the names of the Princesses were unknown to him. He grieved for their unhappy fate, and at once proceeded to bury them; but no sooner had he laid them in their graves, than their hands started up through <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fellow;grave;fate;hand' adjectives='unhappy' verbs='proceed;grieve;start;remain;lay;have;bury;stick' valence='5.06133333333' arousal='4.25933333333' dominance='5.42066666667'>the earth</entity> and remained sticking up like those of their fellows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='548'>The Prince went on his way, thinking about this strange adventure, when suddenly at the turn of the walk he perceived a tall man whose face was the picture of misery, holding in his hands a silken cord of the exact colour of those round the necks of the dead men. A few steps further this man came up with another as miserable to the full as he himself; they silently embraced, and then without a word passed the cords round their throats, and fell dead side by side. In vain the Prince rushed to their assistance and strove to undo the cord. He could not loosen it; so he buried them like the others and continued his path.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='549'>He felt, however, that great prudence was necessary, or he himself might become the victim of some enchantment; and he was thankful to slip past the dragons, and enter a beautiful park, with clear streams and sweet flowers, and a crowd of men and maidens. But he could not forget the terrible things he had seen, and hoped eagerly for a clue to the mystery. Noticing two young people talking together, he drew near thinking that he might get some explanation of what puzzled him. And so he did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='550'>"You swear," said the Prince, "that you will love me till you die, but I fear your faithless heart, and I feel that I shall soon have to seek the Fairy Despair, ruler of half this island. She carries off the lovers who have been cast away by their mistresses, and wish to have done with life. She places them in a labyrinth where they are condemned to walk for ever, with a bracelet on their arms and a cord round their necks, unless they meet another as miserable as themselves. Then the cord is pulled and they lie where they fall, till they are buried by the first passer by. Terrible as this death would be," added the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;death;love' adjectives='terrible;sweeter' verbs='be;add;have;lose' valence='5.22384615385' arousal='4.47153846154' dominance='5.17384615385'>Prince</entity>, "it would be sweeter than life if I had lost your love."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='551'>The sight of all these happy lovers only made the Prince grieve the more, and he wandered along the seashore spending his days; but one day he was sitting on a rock bewailing his fate, and the impossibility of leaving the island, when all in a moment the sea appeared to raise itself nearly to the skies, and the caves echoed with hideous screams. As he looked a woman rose from the depths of the sea, flying madly before a furious giant. The cries she uttered softened the heart of the Prince; he took the stone from his mouth, and drawing his sword he rushed after the giant, so as to give the lady time to escape. But hardly had he come within reach of the enemy, than the giant touched him with a ring that he held in his hand, and the Prince remained immovable where he stood. The giant then hastily rejoined his prey, and, seizing her in his arms, he plunged her into the sea. Then he sent some tritons to bind chains about the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='triton;depths;hope;chain' adjectives='' verbs='feel;bind;see;bear;send' valence='6.2875' arousal='4.27583333333' dominance='5.21916666667'>Prince</entity> of the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='triton;depths;hope;chain' adjectives='' verbs='feel;bind;see;bear;send' valence='6.2875' arousal='4.27583333333' dominance='5.21916666667'>Golden Isle</entity>, and he too felt himself borne to the depths of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='triton;depths;hope;chain' adjectives='' verbs='feel;bind;see;bear;send' valence='6.2875' arousal='4.27583333333' dominance='5.21916666667'>the ocean</entity>, and without the hope of ever again seeing the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='triton;depths;hope;chain' adjectives='' verbs='feel;bind;see;bear;send' valence='6.2875' arousal='4.27583333333' dominance='5.21916666667'>Princess</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='552'>Now the giant whom the invisible had so rashly attacked was the Lord of the Sea, and the third son of the Queen of the Elements, and he had touched the youth with a magic ring which enabled a mortal to live under water.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='554'>At these words the unhappy Prince found himself tied to a rock; but he was not alone in his misfortunes, for all round him were chained Princes and Princesses, whom the giant had led captive. Indeed, it was his chief delight to create a storm, in order to add to the list of his prisoners.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='555'>As his hands were fastened, it was impossible for the Prince of the Golden Isle to make use of his magic stone, and he passed his nights and days dreaming of Rosalie. But at last the time came when the giant took it into his head to amuse himself by arranging fights between some of his captives. Lots were drawn, and one fell upon our Prince, whose chains were immediately loosened. The moment he was set free, he snatched up his stone, and became invisible.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='556'>The astonishment of the giant at the sudden disappearance of the Prince may well be imagined. He ordered all the passages to be watched, but it was too late, for the Prince had already glided between two rocks. He wandered for a long while through the forests, where he met nothing but fearful monsters; he climbed rock after rock, steered his way from tree to tree, till at length he arrived at the edge of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mountain;monster;captive;tree;foot;length;edge;forest;way;rock;nothing' adjectives='fearful;long' verbs='be;hold;remember;see;have;meet;climb;arrive;wander;steer' valence='5.63321428571' arousal='3.96892857143' dominance='5.42964285714'>the sea</entity>, at the foot of a mountain that he remembered to have seen in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='mountain;monster;captive;tree;foot;length;edge;forest;way;rock;nothing' adjectives='fearful;long' verbs='be;hold;remember;see;have;meet;climb;arrive;wander;steer' valence='5.63321428571' arousal='3.96892857143' dominance='5.42964285714'>the cabinet</entity> of the present, where <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mountain;monster;captive;tree;foot;length;edge;forest;way;rock;nothing' adjectives='fearful;long' verbs='be;hold;remember;see;have;meet;climb;arrive;wander;steer' valence='5.63321428571' arousal='3.96892857143' dominance='5.42964285714'>Rosalie</entity> was held captive.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='557'>Filled with joy, he made his way to the top of the mountain which pierced the clouds, and there he found a palace. He entered, and in the middle of a long gallery he discovered a crystal room, in the midst of which sat Rosalie, guarded night and day by genii. There was no door anywhere, nor any window. At this sight the Prince became more puzzled than ever, for he did not know how he was to warn Rosalie of his return. Yet it broke his heart to see her weeping from dawn till dark.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='558'>One day, as Rosalie was walking up and down her room, she was surprised to see that the crystal which served for a wall had grown cloudy, as if some one had breathed on it, and, what was more, wherever she moved the brightness of the crystal always became clouded. This was enough to cause the Princess to suspect that her lover had returned. In order to set the Prince of the Air"s mind at rest she began by being very gracious to him, so that when she begged that her captivity might be a little lightened she should not be refused. At first the only favour she asked was to be allowed to walk for one hour every day up and down the long gallery. This was granted, and the Invisible Prince speedily took the opportunity of handing her the stone, which she at once slipped into her mouth. No words can paint the fury of her captor at her disappearance. He ordered the spirits of the air to fly through all space, and to bring back Rosalie wherever she might be. They instantly flew off to obey his commands, and spread themselves over the whole earth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='559'>Meantime Rosalie and the Invisible Prince had reached, hand in hand, a door of the gallery which led through a terrace into the gardens. In silence they glided along, and thought themselves already safe, when a furious monster dashed itself by accident against Rosalie and the Invisible Prince, and in her fright she let go his hand. No one can speak as long as he is invisible, and besides, they knew that the spirits were all around them, and at the slightest sound they would be recognised; so all they could do was to feel about in the hope that their hands might once more meet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='560'>But, alas! the joy of liberty lasted but a short time. The Princess, having wandered in vain up and down the forest, stopped at last on the edge of a fountain. As she walked she wrote on the trees: "If ever the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tear;tree;water;edge;fountain;way;lover' adjectives='' verbs='be;mingle;sit;walk;write;let;know;dwell;come' valence='5.8575' arousal='3.9685' dominance='5.4855'>Prince</entity>, my lover, comes this way, let him know that it is here I dwell, and that I sit daily on the edge of this fountain, mingling my tears with its waters."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='561'>These words were read by one of the genii, who repeated them to his master. The Prince of the Air, in his turn making himself invisible, was led to the fountain, and waited for Rosalie.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='564'>The unhappy youth had determined to let himself die, and indeed his sorrow alone was enough to kill him, when the thought that by means of the cabinets of the years he might find out where the Princess was imprisoned, gave him a little ray of comfort. So he continued to walk on through the forest, and after some hours he arrived at the gate of a temple, guarded by two huge lions. Being invisible, he was able to enter unharmed. In the middle of the temple was an altar, on which lay a book, and behind the altar hung a great curtain. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='abyss;entrance;name;gold;altar;air;book;fountain;way;lover;world' adjectives='' verbs='be;read;approach;lay;have;contain;carry;open' valence='5.99666666667' arousal='4.06625' dominance='5.49625'>Prince</entity> approached the altar and opened the book, which contained the names of all the lovers in the world: and in it he read that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='abyss;entrance;name;gold;altar;air;book;fountain;way;lover;world' adjectives='' verbs='be;read;approach;lay;have;contain;carry;open' valence='5.99666666667' arousal='4.06625' dominance='5.49625'>Rosalie</entity> had been carried off by the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='abyss;entrance;name;gold;altar;air;book;fountain;way;lover;world' adjectives='' verbs='be;read;approach;lay;have;contain;carry;open' valence='5.99666666667' arousal='4.06625' dominance='5.49625'>Prince</entity> of the Air to an abyss which had no entrance except the one that lay by way of the Fountain of Gold.</paragraph>

So I have resolved to put myself out of my pain by means of the Golden Fountain. A single drop of its water falling on the sand around will trace the name of my rival in her heart. I dread the test, and yet this very dread convinces me of my misfortune."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='569'>It may be imagined that after listening to these words the Invisible Prince followed Prince Gnome like his shadow, and after walking some time they arrived at the Golden Fountain.

As, since he had been touched by the Giant"s ring, he had the power to live in the water as well as on land, he at once dived into the fountain. He perceived in one corner a door leading into the mountain, and at the foot of the mountain was a high rock on which was fixed an iron ring with a cord attached. The Prince promptly guessed that the cord was used to chain the Princess, and drew his sword and cut it.

"Wait," he said; "that does not please me; only let me find the right people, and the King shall yet give me all the treasures of his kingdom."

And when they had gone a little way they came upon a hunter, who was on his knees, his gun on his shoulder, aiming at something. The master said to him, "<entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='master' adjectives='' verbs='aim;be;say' valence='5.94' arousal='4.065' dominance='5.7625'>Hunter</entity>, what are you aiming at?"</paragraph>

Then the runner got a pitcher, and the King"s daughter another, and they began to run at the same time; but in a moment, when the King"s daughter was only just a little way off, no spectator could see the runner, and it seemed as if the wind had whistled past.

He saw the hawk swooping down upon the church, and in a moment he had seized his gun and shot at the bird. The hawk fell heavily under a big stone, severely wounded in its right wing. The youth ran to look at it, and saw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone. He went at once to fetch his brothers, and with their help dragged a lot of pine-wood and ropes to the spot. They fastened some of the burning pine-wood to the end of the rope, and let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss. At first it was quite dark, and the flaming torch only lit up dirty grey stone walls. But the youngest brother determined to explore the abyss, and letting himself down by the rope he soon reached the bottom. Here he found a lovely meadow full of green trees and exquisite flowers.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='800'>In the middle of the meadow stood a huge stone castle, with an iron gate leading to it, which was wide open. Everything in the castle seemed to be made of copper, and the only inhabitant he could discover was a lovely girl, who was combing her golden hair; and he noticed that whenever one of her hairs fell on the ground it rang out like pure metal. The youth looked at her more closely, and saw that her skin was smooth and fair, her blue eyes bright and sparkling, and her hair as golden as the sun. He fell in love with her on the spot, and kneeling at her feet, he implored her to become his wife.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='801'>The lovely girl accepted his proposal gladly; but at the same time she warned him that she could never come up to the world above till her mother, the old witch, was dead.

She was combing her silver hair, and every hair that fell on the ground rang out like pure metal. The second girl handed him the sword, but though he tried with all his strength he could not lift it. At last a third sister came to him and gave him a drop of something to drink, which she said would give him the needful strength. He drank one drop, but still he could not lift the sword; then he drank a second, and the sword began to move; but only after he had drunk a third drop was he able to swing the sword over his head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='803'>Then he hid himself in the castle and awaited the old witch"s arrival. At last as it was beginning to grow dark she appeared. She swooped down upon a big apple-tree, and after shaking some golden apples from it, she pounced down upon the earth.

This was the moment the youth was waiting for, and he swung his mighty sword in the air with all his strength and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='strength;wall;s;air;youth;moment;blood;sword' adjectives='mighty' verbs='be;head;swing;fall;spurt;wait' valence='5.505' arousal='4.396875' dominance='5.425'>the witch</entity>"s head fell off, and her blood spurted up on the walls.</paragraph>

First the treasures were attached to the rope and then the three lovely girls. And now everything was up above and only he himself remained below. But as he was a little suspicious of his brothers, he fastened a heavy stone on to the rope and let them pull it up.

They trembled with terror when they saw the hideous creature, and hid themselves beneath the leaves.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='887'>Far away, in North America, where the Red Indians dwell, there lived a long time ago a beautiful maiden, who was lovelier than any other girl in the whole tribe. Many of the young braves sought her in marriage, but she would listen to one only--a handsome chief, who had taken her fancy some years before. So they were to be married, and great rejoicings were made, and the two looked forward to a long life of happiness together, when the very night before the wedding feast a sudden illness seized <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='life;illness;word;rejoicing;friend;wedding;happiness' adjectives='great;sudden;round;long' verbs='be;look;seize;marry;feast;pass;weep;make' valence='5.9744' arousal='4.358' dominance='5.426'>the girl</entity>, and, without a word to her friends who were weeping round her, she passed silently away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='888'>The heart of her lover had been set upon her, and the thought of her remained with him night and day. He put aside his bow, and went neither to fight nor to hunt, but from sunrise to sunset he sat by the place where she was laid, thinking of his happiness that was buried there. At last, after many days, a light seemed to come to him out of the darkness. He remembered having heard from the old, old people of the tribe, that there was a path that led to the Land of Souls--that if you sought carefully you could find it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='889'>So the next morning he got up early, and put some food in his pouch and slung an extra skin over his shoulders, for he knew not how long his journey would take, nor what sort of country he would have to go through. Only one thing he knew, that if the path was there, he would find it. At first he was puzzled, as there seemed no reason he should go in one direction more than another. Then all at once he thought he had heard one of the old men say that the Land of Souls lay to the south, and so, filled with new hope and courage, he set his face southwards. For many, many miles the country looked the same as it did round his own home. The forests, the hills, and the rivers all seemed exactly like the ones he had left. The only thing that was different was the snow, which had lain thick upon the hills and trees when he started, but grew less and less the farther he went south, till it disappeared altogether. Soon the trees put forth their buds, and flowers sprang up under his feet, and instead of thick clouds there was blue sky over his head, and everywhere the birds were singing. Then he knew that he was in the right road.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='890'>The thought that he should soon behold his lost bride made his heart beat for joy, and he sped along lightly and swiftly. Now his way led through a dark wood, and then over some steep cliffs, and on the top of these he found a hut or wigwam. An old man clothed in skins, and holding a staff in his hand, stood in the doorway; and he said to the young chief who was beginning to tell his story, "I was waiting for you, wherefore you have come I know. It is but a short while since she whom you seek was here. Rest in my hut, as she also rested, and I will tell you what you ask, and whither you should go."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='891'>On hearing these words, the young man entered the hut, but his heart was too eager within him to suffer him to rest, and when he arose, the old man rose too, and stood with him at the door. "Look," he said, "at the water which lies far out yonder, and the plains which stretch beyond. That is the Land of Souls, but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him. So, lay down your body here; your bow and arrows, your skin and your dog. They shall be kept for you safely."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='892'>Then he turned away, and the young chief, light as air, seemed hardly to touch the ground; and as he flew along the scents grew sweeter and the flowers more beautiful, while the animals rubbed their noses against him, instead of hiding as he approached, and birds circled round him, and fishes lifted up their heads and looked as he went by. Very soon he noticed with wonder, that neither rocks nor trees barred his path. He passed through them without knowing it, for indeed, they were not rocks and trees at all, but only the souls of them; for this was the Land of Shadows.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='893'>So he went on with winged feet till he came to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;canoe;island;lake;paddle;middle;foot' adjectives='winged;great;lovely' verbs='go;be;come;shine;glitter' valence='5.98304347826' arousal='3.84739130435' dominance='5.66217391304'>the shores</entity> of a great lake, with a lovely island in the middle of it; while on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;canoe;island;lake;paddle;middle;foot' adjectives='winged;great;lovely' verbs='go;be;come;shine;glitter' valence='5.98304347826' arousal='3.84739130435' dominance='5.66217391304'>the bank</entity> of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='stone;canoe;island;lake;paddle;middle;foot' adjectives='winged;great;lovely' verbs='go;be;come;shine;glitter' valence='5.98304347826' arousal='3.84739130435' dominance='5.66217391304'>the lake</entity> was a canoe of glittering stone, and in the canoe were two shining paddles.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='894'>The chief jumped straight into the canoe, and seizing the paddles pushed off from the shore, when to his joy and wonder he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own the maiden for whose sake he had made this long journey. But they could not touch each other, for between them rolled great waves, which looked as if they would sink the boats, yet never did. And the young man and the maiden shrank with fear, for down in the depths of the water they saw the bones of those who had died before, and in the waves themselves men and women were struggling, and but few passed over. Only the children had no fear, and reached the other side in safety. Still, though the chief and the young girl quailed in terror at these horrible sights and sounds, no harm came to them, for their lives had been free from evil, and the Master of Life had said that no evil should happen unto them. So they reached unhurt the shore of the Happy Island, and wandered through the flowery fields and by the banks of rushing streams, and they knew not hunger nor thirst; neither cold nor heat. The air fed them and the sun warmed them, and they forgot the dead, for they saw no graves, and the young man"s thoughts turned not to wars, neither to the hunting of animals. And gladly would these two have walked thus for ever, but in the murmur of the wind he heard the Master of Life saying to him, "Return whither you came, for I have work for you to do, and your people need you, and for many years you shall rule over them. At the gate my messenger awaits you, and you shall take again your body which you left behind, and he will show you what you are to do. Listen to him, and have patience, and in time to come you shall rejoin her whom you must now leave, for she is accepted, and will remain ever young and beautiful, as when I called her hence from the Land of Snows."</paragraph>

For she had no idea that the kind-looking old woman leaning on her crutch was in reality a wicked witch, who envied the Queen her good fortune, and was determined to ruin her. And so, in all ignorance, the Queen followed her out into the garden and listened to her smooth, flattering words. Now, in the middle of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;middle;woman;crystal;pond' adjectives='clear;old' verbs='be;say' valence='6.0475' arousal='3.79916666667' dominance='5.81416666667'>the garden</entity> there was a pond of water, clear as crystal, and the old woman said to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='water;middle;woman;crystal;pond' adjectives='clear;old' verbs='be;say' valence='6.0475' arousal='3.79916666667' dominance='5.81416666667'>Queen</entity>:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1119'>"Truly," thought Martin to himself, "it would be more sensible to save a fellow-being"s life with this sand than to drag it about on one"s back, seeing what a weight it is." And forthwith he lowered the sack from his shoulders and emptied its contents on the flames, and instantly the fire was extinguished; but at the same moment lo! and behold the lovely damsel turned into a Serpent, and, darting upon him, coiled itself round his neck, and whispered lovingly in his ear:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1120'>"Do not be afraid of me, Martin; I love you, and will go with you through the world. But first you must follow me boldly into my Father"s Kingdom, underneath the earth; and when we get there, remember this--he will offer you gold and silver, and dazzling gems, but do not touch them. Ask him, instead, for the ring which he wears on his little finger, for in that ring lies a magic power; you have only to throw it from one hand to the other, and at once twelve young men will appear, who will do your bidding, no matter how difficult, in a single night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1121'>So they started on their way, and after much wandering they reached a spot where a great rock rose straight up in the middle of the road. Instantly the Serpent uncoiled itself from his neck, and, as it touched the damp earth, it resumed the shape of the lovely damsel. Pointing to the rock, she showed him an opening just big enough for a man to wriggle through. Passing into it, they entered a long underground passage, which led out on to a wide field, above which spread a blue sky. In the middle of the field stood a magnificent castle, built out of porphyry, with a roof of gold and with glittering battlements. And his beautiful guide told him that this was <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='kingdom;father;guide' adjectives='beautiful' verbs='be;live;tell;reign' valence='6.39555555556' arousal='4.19555555556' dominance='5.75444444444'>the palace</entity> in which her father lived and reigned over his kingdom in the Under-world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1122'>Together they entered the palace, and were received by the King with great kindness. Turning to his daughter, he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1123'>"My child, I had almost given up the hope of ever seeing you again. Where have you been all these years?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1124'>"My father," she replied, "I owe my life to this youth, who saved me from a terrible death."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1125'>Upon which the King turned to Martin with a gracious smile, saying: "I will reward your courage by granting you whatever your heart desires. Take as much gold, silver, and precious stones as you choose."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1126'>"I thank you, mighty King, for your gracious offer," answered Martin," "but I do not covet either gold, silver, or precious stones; yet if you will grant me a favour, give me, I beg, the ring from off the little finger of your royal hand. Every time my eye falls on it I shall think of your gracious Majesty, and when I marry I shall present it to my bride."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1127'>So the King took the ring from his finger and gave it to Martin, saying: "Take it, good youth; but with it I make one condition--you are never to confide to anyone that this is a magic ring.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1128'>Martin took the ring, and, having thanked the King, he set out on the same road by which he had come down into the Under-world. When he had regained the upper air he started for his old home, and having found his mother still living in the old house where he had left her, they settled down together very happily. So uneventful was their life that it almost seemed as if it would go on in this way always, without let or hindrance. But one day it suddenly came into his mind that he would like to get married, and, moreover, that he would choose a very grand wife--a King"s daughter, in short. But as he did not trust himself as a wooer, he determined to send his old mother on the mission.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1129'>"You must go to <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='marriage;daughter;hand' adjectives='lovely' verbs='go;say;demand' valence='6.052' arousal='4.657' dominance='5.559'>the King</entity>," he said to her, "and demand the hand of his lovely daughter in marriage for me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1130'>"What are you thinking of, my son?" answered the old woman, aghast at the idea. "Why cannot you marry someone in your own rank? That would be far more fitting than to send a poor old woman like me a-wooing to the King"s Court for the hand of a Princess. Why, it is as much as our heads are worth. Neither my life nor yours would be worth anything if I went on such a fool"s errand."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1131'>"Never fear, little mother," answered Martin. "Trust me; all will be well. But see that you do not come back without an answer of some kind."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1132'>And so, obedient to her son"s behest, the old woman hobbled off to the palace, and, without being hindered, reached the courtyard, and began to mount the flight of steps leading to the royal presence chamber. At the head of the landing rows of courtiers were collected in magnificent attire, who stared at the queer old figure, and called to her, and explained to her, with every kind of sign, that it was strictly forbidden to mount those steps. But their stern words and forbidding gestures made no impression whatever on the old woman, and she resolutely continued to climb the stairs, bent on carrying out her son"s orders. Upon this some of the courtiers seized her by the arms, and held her back by sheer force, at which she set up such a yell that the King himself heard it, and stepped out on to the balcony to see what was the matter. When he beheld the old woman flinging her arms wildly about, and heard her scream that she would not leave the place till she had laid her case before the King, he ordered that she should be brought into his presence. And forthwith she was conducted into the golden presence chamber, where, leaning back amongst cushions of royal purple, the King sat, surrounded by his counsellors and courtiers. Courtesying low, the old woman stood silent before him. "Well, my good old dame, what can I do for you?" asked <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask' valence='5.975' arousal='3.965' dominance='5.91'>the King</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1133'>"I have come," replied <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='a-wooing;s;majesty;mother' adjectives='angry' verbs='reply;come;have;be' valence='5.55' arousal='4.34142857143' dominance='5.57857142857'>Martin</entity>"s mother--"and your Majesty must not be angry with me--I have come a-wooing."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1134'>"Is the woman out of her mind?" said <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='frown' adjectives='angry' verbs='say' valence='4.558' arousal='4.738' dominance='5.294'>the King</entity>, with an angry frown.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1135'>But Martin"s mother answered boldly: "If the King will only listen patiently to me, and give me a straightforward answer, he will see that I am not out of my mind. You, O King, have a lovely daughter to give in marriage. I have a son--a wooer--as clever a youth and as good a son-in-law as you will find in your whole kingdom. There is nothing that he cannot do. Now tell me, O King, plump and plain, will you give your daughter to my son as wife?" The King listened to the end of the old woman"s strange request, but every moment his face grew blacker, and his features sterner; till all at once he thought to himself, "Is it worth while that I, the King, should be angry with this poor old fool?" And all the courtiers and counsellors were amazed when they saw the hard lines round his mouth and the frown on his brow grow smooth, and heard the mild but mocking tones in which he answered the old woman, saying:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1136'>"If your son is as wonderfully clever as you say, and if there is nothing in the world that he cannot do, let him build a magnificent castle, just opposite my palace windows, in four and twenty hours. The palace must be joined together by a bridge of pure crystal. On each side of the bridge there must be growing trees, having golden and silver apples, and with birds of Paradise among the branches. At the right of the bridge there must be a church, with five golden cupolas; in this church your son shall be wedded to my daughter, and we will keep the wedding festivities in the new castle. But if he fails to execute this my royal command, then, as a just but mild monarch, I shall give orders that you and he are taken, and first dipped in tar and then in feathers, and you shall be executed in the market-place for the entertainment of my courtiers."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1137'>And a smile played round the King"s lips as he finished speaking, and his courtiers and counsellors shook with laughter when they thought of the old woman"s folly, and praised the King"s wise device, and said to each other, "What a joke it will be when we see the pair of them tarred and feathered! The son is just as able to grow a beard on the palm of his hand as to execute such a task in twenty-four hours."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1138'>Now the poor old woman was mortally afraid and, in a trembling voice she asked:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1139'>"Is that really your royal will, O King? Must I take this order to my poor son?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1140'>"Yes, old dame; such is my command. If your son carries out my order, he shall be rewarded with my daughter; but if he fails, away to the tar-barrel and the stake with you both!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1141'>On her way home the poor old woman shed bitter tears, and when she saw <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tear;home;woman;way' adjectives='poor;bitter;old' verbs='shed;sob;see;say;have;tell' valence='4.95214285714' arousal='4.14571428571' dominance='5.18785714286'>Martin</entity> she told him what <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tear;home;woman;way' adjectives='poor;bitter;old' verbs='shed;sob;see;say;have;tell' valence='4.95214285714' arousal='4.14571428571' dominance='5.18785714286'>the King</entity> had said, and sobbed out:</paragraph>

It is terrible!" and she moaned and cried.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1143'>"Never fear, little mother," answered Martin; "trust me, and you will see all will be well. You may go to sleep with a quiet mind."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1144'>And, stepping to the front of the hut, Martin threw his ring from the palm of one hand into the other, upon which twelve youths instantly appeared, and demanded what he wanted them to do.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1146'>At each side of the bridge trees were growing, from whose branches hung golden and silver apples, among which birds of Paradise perched. At the right, gleaming in the sun, were the five golden cupolas of a splendid church, whose bells rang out, as if they would summon people from all corners of the earth to come and behold the wonder. Now, though the King would much rather have seen his future son-in-law tarred, feathered, and burnt at the stake, he remembered his royal oath, and had to make the best of a bad business.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1147'>After the wedding Martin and his royal bride went to dwell in the magnificent new palace, and here Martin lived in the greatest comfort and luxury, such luxury as he had never imagined. But though he was as happy as the day was long, and as merry as a grig, the King"s daughter fretted all day, thinking of the indignity that had been done her in making her marry Martin, the poor widow"s son, instead of a rich young Prince from a foreign country. So unhappy was she that she spent all her time wondering how she should get rid of her undesirable husband. And first she determined to learn the secret of his power, and, with flattering, caressing words, she tried to coax him to tell her how he was so clever that there was nothing in the world that he could not do. At first he would tell her nothing; but once, when he was in a yielding mood, she approached him with a winning smile on her lovely face, and, speaking flattering words to him, she gave him a potion to drink, with a sweet, strong taste. And when he had drunk it Martin"s lips were unsealed, and he told her that all his power lay in the magic ring that he wore on his finger, and he described to her how to use it, and, still speaking, he fell into a deep sleep.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1151'>Then, in the hour of his dire necessity, his old friends Schurka (the dog) and Waska (the cat) remembered how Martin had once saved them from a cruel death; and they took counsel together as to how they should help him. And Schurka growled, and was of opinion that he would like to tear everyone in pieces; but Waska purred meditatively, and scratched the back of her ear with a velvet paw, and remained lost in thought. At the end of a few minutes she had made up her mind, and, turning to Schurka, said: "Let us go together into the town, and the moment we meet a baker you must make a rush between his legs and upset the tray from off his head; I will lay hold of the rolls, and will carry them off to our master." No sooner said than done.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1157'>At that moment Schurka made a rush between his legs--the baker stumbled, the tray was upset, the rolls fell to the ground, and, while the man angrily pursued Schurka, Waska managed to drag the rolls out of sight behind a bush. And when a moment later Schurka joined her, they set off at full tilt to the stone tower where Martin was a prisoner, taking the rolls with them. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='window;voice' adjectives='anxious;agile;outside' verbs='grate;be;climb;call' valence='5.59777777778' arousal='4.15777777778' dominance='5.50333333333'>Waska</entity>, being very agile, climbed up by the outside to the grated window, and called in an anxious voice:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1160'>"Never fear, dear master. Schurka and I will look after you," said Waska. And in another moment she had climbed down and brought him back a roll, and then another, and another, till she had brought him the whole tray-load. Upon which she said: "Dear master, Schurka and I are going off to a distant kingdom at the utmost ends of the earth to fetch you back your magic ring. You must be careful that the rolls last till our return."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1161'>And Waska took leave of her beloved master, and set off with Schurka on their journey. On and on they travelled, looking always to right and left for traces of the Princess, following up every track, making inquiries of every cat and dog they met, listening to the talk of every wayfarer they passed; and at last they heard that the kingdom at the utmost ends of the earth where the twelve youths had borne the Princess was not very far off. And at last one day they reached that distant kingdom, and, going at once to the palace, they began to make friends with all the dogs and cats in the place, and to question them about the Princess and the magic ring; but no one could tell them much about either. Now one day it chanced that Waska had gone down to the palace cellar to hunt for mice and rats, and seeing an especially fat, well-fed mouse, she pounced upon it, buried her claws in its soft fur, and was just going to gobble it up, when she was stopped by the pleading tones of the little creature, saying, "If you will only spare my life I may be of great service to you.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1163'>"Good!" replied the mouse; "I will do what you ask." And, so saying, he summoned all the mice in his kingdom together. A countless number of mice, small and big, brown and grey, assembled, and formed a circle round their king, who was a prisoner under Waska"s claws. Turning to them he said: "Dear and faithful subjects, who ever among you will steal the magic ring from the strange <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='dear;ring;death;mouse;subject' adjectives='other;cruel;strange;magic;faithful' verbs='release;turn;say;steal;honour' valence='5.38761904762' arousal='4.37238095238' dominance='5.5680952381'>Princess</entity> will release me from a cruel death; and I shall honour him above all the other mice in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='dear;ring;death;mouse;subject' adjectives='other;cruel;strange;magic;faithful' verbs='release;turn;say;steal;honour' valence='5.38761904762' arousal='4.37238095238' dominance='5.5680952381'>the kingdom</entity>."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1164'>Instantly a tiny mouse stepped forward and said: "I often creep about the Princess"s bedroom at night, and I have noticed that she has a ring which she treasures as the apple of her eye.

	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='1165'>And the tiny mouse tripped away into the bedroom of the Princess, and waited for nightfall; then, when the Princess had fallen asleep, it crept up on to her bed, and gnawed a hole in the pillow, through which it dragged one by one little down feathers, and threw them under the Princess"s nose. And the fluff flew into the Princess"s nose, and into her mouth, and starting up she sneezed and coughed, and the ring fell out of her mouth on to the coverlet. In a flash the tiny mouse had seized it, and brought it to Waska as a ransom for the King of the Mice.

Her husband laughed at his wife"s strange idea, and they went back into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='s;idea;husband;wife' adjectives='strange' verbs='go;laugh' valence='6.30111111111' arousal='4.41888888889' dominance='5.77333333333'>the house</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1300'>But after a short time the woman gave birth to a little girl, who was as white as snow and as cold as ice. If they brought the child anywhere near the fire, it screamed loudly till they put it back into some cool place. The little maid throve wonderfully, and in a few months she could run about and speak. But she was not altogether easy to bring up, and gave her parents much trouble and anxiety, for all summer she insisted on spending in the cellar, and in the winter she would sleep outside in the snow, and the colder it was the happier she seemed to be. Her father and mother called her simply "Our Snow-daughter," and this name stuck to her all her life.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1301'>One day her parents sat by the fire, talking over the extraordinary behaviour of their daughter, who was disporting herself in the snowstorm that raged outside. The woman sighed deeply and said, "I wish I had given birth to a Fire-son!" As she said these words, a spark from the big wood fire flew into the woman"s lap, and she said with a laugh, "Now perhaps I shall give birth to a Fire-son!" The man laughed at his wife"s words, and thought it was a good joke. But he ceased to think it a joke when his wife shortly afterwards gave birth to a boy, who screamed lustily till he was put quite close to the fire, and who nearly yelled himself into a fit if the Snow-daughter came anywhere near him. The Snow-daughter herself avoided him as much as she could, and always crept into a corner as far away from him as possible. The parents called the boy simply "Our Fire-son," a name which stuck to him all his life. They had a great deal of trouble and worry with him too; but he throve and grew very quickly, and before he was a year old he could run about and talk. He was as red as fire, and as hot to touch, and he always sat on the hearth quite close to the fire, and complained of the cold; if his sister were in the room he almost crept into the flames, while the girl on her part always complained of the great heat if her brother were anywhere near. In summer <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sister;cellar;sun;brother;contact;fact' adjectives='little;other' verbs='come;happen;hide;lay;avoid' valence='5.958125' arousal='3.96125' dominance='5.535625'>the boy</entity> always lay out in the sun, while <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='sister;cellar;sun;brother;contact;fact' adjectives='little;other' verbs='come;happen;hide;lay;avoid' valence='5.958125' arousal='3.96125' dominance='5.535625'>the girl</entity> hid herself in the cellar: so it happened that the brother and sister came very little into contact with each other--in fact, they carefully avoided it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1302'>Just as the girl grew up into a beautiful woman, her father and mother both died one after the other. Then the Fire-son, who had grown up in the meantime into a fine, strong young man, said to his sister, "I am going out into the world, for what is the use of remaining on here?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1303'>"I shall go with you," she answered, "for, except you, I have no one in the world, and I have a feeling that if we set out together we shall be lucky."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1304'>The Fire-son said, "I love you with all my heart, but at the same time I always freeze if you are near me, and you nearly die of heat if I approach you! How shall we travel about together without being odious the one to the other?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1305'>"Don"t worry about that," replied the girl, "for I"ve thought it all over, and have settled on a plan which will make us each able to bear with the other! See, I have had a fur cloak made for each of us, and if we put them on I shall not feel the heat so much nor you the cold." So they put on the fur cloaks, and set out cheerfully on their way, and for the first time in their lives quite happy in each other"s company.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1306'>For a long time the Fire-son and the Snow-daughter wandered through the world, and when at the beginning of winter they came to a big wood they determined to stay there till spring. The Fire-son built himself a hut where he always kept up a huge fire, while his sister with very few clothes on stayed outside night and day. Now it happened one day that the King of the land held a hunt in this wood, and saw the Snow-daughter wandering about in the open air. He wondered very much who the beautiful girl clad in such garments could be, and he stopped and spoke to her. He soon learnt that she could not stand heat, and that her brother could not endure cold. The King was so charmed by the Snow-daughter, that he asked her to be his wife. The girl consented, and the wedding was held with much state. The King had a huge house of ice made for his wife underground, so that even in summer it did not melt. But for his brother-in-law he had a house built with huge ovens all round it, that were kept heated all day and night. The Fire-son was delighted, but the perpetual heat in which he lived made his body so hot, that it was dangerous to go too close to him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1307'>One day the King gave a great feast, and asked his brother-in-law among the other guests. The Fire-son did not appear till everyone had assembled, and when he did, everyone fled outside to the open air, so intense was the heat he gave forth. Then the King was very angry and said, "If I had known what a lot of trouble you would have been, I would never have taken you into my house." Then the Fire-son replied with a laugh, "Don"t be angry, dear brother! I love heat and my sister loves cold--come here and let me embrace you, and then I"ll go home at once." And before the King had time to reply, the Fire-son seized him in a tight embrace. The King screamed aloud in agony, and when his wife, the Snow-daughter, who had taken refuge from her brother in the next room, hurried to him, the King lay dead on the ground burnt to a cinder. When the Snow-daughter saw this she turned on her brother and flew at him. Then a fight began, the like of which had never been seen on earth. When the people, attracted by the noise, hurried to the spot, they saw the Snow-daughter melting into water and the Fire-son burn to a cinder. And so ended the unhappy brother and sister.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1311'>There was once upon a time a peasant-woman who had a daughter and a step-daughter. The daughter had her own way in everything, and whatever she did was right in her mother"s eyes; but the poor step-daughter had a hard time. Let her do what she would, she was always blamed, and got small thanks for all the trouble she took; nothing was right, everything wrong; and yet, if the truth were known, the girl was worth her weight in gold--she was so unselfish and good-hearted. But her step-mother did not like her, and the poor girl"s days were spent in weeping; for it was impossible to live peacefully with the woman. The wicked shrew was determined to get rid of the girl by fair means or foul, and kept saying to her father: "Send her away, old man; send her away--anywhere so that my eyes sha"n"t be plagued any longer by the sight of her, or my ears tormented by the sound of her voice. Send her out into the fields, and let the cutting frost do for her."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1312'>In vain did the poor old father weep and implore her pity; she was firm, and he dared not gainsay her. So he placed his daughter in a sledge, not even daring to give her a horse-cloth to keep herself warm with, and drove her out on to the bare, open fields, where he kissed her and left her, driving home as fast as he could, that he might not witness her miserable death.</paragraph>

So the girl set out to look for the cat, and, as she was hunting about, she met her brother, in great trouble because he could not carry water from the well in a sieve, as it came pouring out as fast as he put it in. And as she was trying to comfort him they heard a rustling of wings, and a flight of wrens alighted on the ground beside them. And the wrens said:</paragraph>

In the morning the witch gave the girl two pieces of linen to weave before night, and the boy a pile of wood to cut into chips. Then the witch left them to their tasks, and went out into the wood. As soon as she had gone out of sight the children took the comb and the handkerchief, and, taking one another by the hand, they started and ran, and ran, and ran. And first they met the watch-dog, who was going to leap on them and tear them to pieces; but they threw the remains of their bread to him, and he ate them and wagged his tail.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1402'>When the witch came up to it, it took her a long time before she found a place which she could ford over on her broom-stick; but at last she got across, and continued the chase faster than before.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1407'>There was once upon a time a couple who had no children, and they prayed Heaven every day to send them a child, though it were no bigger than a hazel-nut. At last Heaven heard their prayer and sent them a child exactly the size of a hazel-nut, and it never grew an inch. The parents were very devoted to the little creature, and nursed and tended it carefully. Their tiny son too was as clever as he could be, and so sharp and sensible that all the neighbours marvelled over the wise things he said and did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1408'>When the Hazel-nut child was fifteen years old, and was sitting one day in an egg-shell on the table beside his mother, she turned to him and said, "You are now fifteen years old, and nothing can be done with you. What do you intend to be?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1409'>"A messenger," answered the Hazel-nut child.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1411'>But the Hazel-nut child replied, "Nevertheless I mean to be a messenger! Just send me a message and you"ll see that I shall be back in next to no time."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1412'>So his mother said, "Very well, go to your aunt in the neighbouring village, and fetch me a comb." The Hazel-nut child jumped quickly out of the egg-shell and ran out into the street. Here he found a man on horseback who was just setting out for the neighbouring village. He crept up the horse"s leg, sat down under the saddle, and then began to pinch the horse and to prick it with a pin. The horse plunged and reared and then set off at a hard gallop, which it continued in spite of its rider"s efforts to stop it. When they reached the village, the Hazel-nut child left off pricking the horse, and the poor tired creature pursued its way at a snail"s pace. The Hazel-nut child took advantage of this, and crept down the horse"s leg; then he ran to his aunt and asked her for a comb. On the way home he met another rider, and did the return journey in exactly the same way. When he handed his mother the comb that his aunt had given him, she was much amazed and asked him, "But how did you manage to get back so quickly?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1413'>"Ah! mother," he replied, "you see I was quite right when I said I knew a messenger was the profession for me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1414'>His father too possessed a horse which he often used to take out into the fields to graze. One day he took the Hazel-nut child with him. At midday the father turned to his small son and said, "Stay here and look after the horse. I must go home and give your mother a message, but I shall be back soon."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1415'>When his father had gone, a robber passed by and saw the horse grazing without any one watching it, for of course he could not see the Hazel-nut child hidden in the grass. So he mounted the horse and rode away. But the Hazel-nut child, who was the most active little creature, climbed up the horse"s tail and began to bite it on the back, enraging the creature to such an extent that it paid no attention to the direction the robber tried to make it go in, but galloped straight home. The father was much astonished when he saw a stranger riding his horse, but the Hazel-nut child climbed down quickly and told him all that had happened, and his father had the robber arrested at once and put into prison.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1416'>One autumn when the Hazel-nut child was twenty years old he said to his parents: "Farewell, my dear father and mother. I am going to set out into the world, and as soon as I have become rich I will return home to you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1417'>The parents laughed at the little man"s words, but did not believe him for a moment. In the evening the Hazel-nut child crept on to the roof, where some storks had built their nest. The storks were fast asleep, and he climbed on to the back of the father-stork and bound a silk cord round the joint of one of its wings, then he crept among its soft downy feathers and fell asleep.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1418'>The next morning the storks flew towards the south, for winter was approaching. The Hazel-nut child flew through the air on the stork"s back, and when he wanted to rest he bound his silk cord on to the joint of the bird"s other wing, so that it could not fly any farther. In this way he reached the country of the black people, where the storks took up their abode close to the capital. When the people saw the Hazel-nut child they were much astonished, and took him with the stork to the King of the country. The King was delighted with the little creature and kept him always beside him, and he soon grew so fond of the little man that he gave him a diamond four times as big as himself. The Hazel-nut child fastened the diamond firmly under the stork"s neck with a ribbon, and when he saw that the other storks were getting ready for their northern flight, he untied the silk cord from his stork"s wings, and away they went, getting nearer home every minute. At length the Hazel-nut child came to his native village; then he undid the ribbon from the stork"s neck and the diamond fell to the ground; he covered it first with sand and stones, and then ran to get his parents, so that they might carry the treasure home, for he himself was not able to lift the great diamond.</paragraph>

Now you shall hear what befell them both, for this is a true story.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1423'>The whole week through Little Klaus had to plough for Big Klaus, and lend him his one horse; then Big Klaus lent him his four horses, but only once a week, and that was on Sunday.

The sun shone brightly, and all the bells in the church-towers were pealing; the people were dressed in their best clothes, and were going to church, with their hymn books under their arms, to hear the minister preach.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1429'>"Alas! Now I have no horse!" said Little Klaus, beginning to cry. Then he flayed the skin off his horse, dried it, and put it in a sack, which he threw over his shoulder, and went into the town to sell it. He had a long way to go, and had to pass through a great dark forest. A dreadful storm came on, in which he lost his way, and before he could get on to the right road night came on, and it was impossible to reach <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='way;storm' adjectives='dreadful;impossible' verbs='be;get;come;reach;lose' valence='5.43' arousal='4.048125' dominance='5.13125'>the town</entity> that evening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1430'>Right in front of him was a large farm-house. The window-shutters were closed, but the light came through the chinks.

That was why the sexton had gone to say good-day to the farmer"s wife when he knew that her husband was not at home, and the good woman therefore put in front of him the best food she had. But when they heard the farmer coming they were frightened, and the farmer"s wife begged the sexton to creep into a great empty chest. He did so, as he knew the poor man could not bear to see a sexton.

Now I saw that the river was a great high-road for the sea-people. Along it they travel underneath from the sea to the land till the river ends.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1540'>They had one daughter, who was called Ingiborg, and one son, whose name was Ring. He was less fond of adventures than men of rank usually were in those days, and was not famous for strength or feats of arms. When he was twelve years old, one fine winter day he rode into the forest along with his men to enjoy himself. They went on a long way, until they caught sight of a hind with a gold ring on its horns. The Prince was eager to catch it, if possible, so they gave chase and rode on without stopping until all the horses began to founder beneath them. At last the Prince"s horse gave way too, and then there came over them a darkness so black that they could no longer see the hind. By this time they were far away from any house, and thought it was high time to be making their way home again, but they found they had got lost now. At first they all kept together, but soon each began to think that he knew the right way best; so they separated, and all went in different directions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1541'>The Prince, too, had got lost like the rest, and wandered on for a time until he came to a little clearing in the forest not far from the sea, where he saw a woman sitting on a chair and a big barrel standing beside her. The Prince went up to her and saluted her politely, and she received him very graciously. He looked down into the barrel then, and saw lying at the bottom an unusually beautiful gold ring, which pleased him so much that he could not take his eyes off it. The woman saw this, and said that he might have it if he would take the trouble to get it; for which the Prince thanked her, and said it was at least worth trying. So he leaned over into the barrel, which did not seem very deep, and thought he would easily reach the ring; but the more he stretched down after it the deeper grew the barrel. As he was thus bending down into it the woman suddenly rose up and pushed him in head first, saying that now he could take up his quarters there. Then she fixed the top on the barrel and threw it out into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='top;barrel' adjectives='' verbs='fix;throw' valence='5.828' arousal='3.736' dominance='5.85'>the sea</entity>.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1543'>How many days he spent thus he could not tell, but at last he felt that the barrel was knocking against rocks, at which he was a little cheered, thinking it was probably land and not merely a reef in the sea. Being something of a swimmer, he at last made up his mind to kick the bottom out of the barrel, and having done so he was able to get on shore, for the rocks by the sea were smooth and level; but overhead there were high cliffs. It seemed difficult to get up these, but he went along the foot of them for a little, till at last he tried to climb up, which at last he did.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1544'>Having got to the top, he looked round about him and saw that he was on an island, which was covered with forest, with apples growing, and altogether pleasant as far as the land was concerned. After he had been there several days, he one day heard a great noise in the forest, which made him terribly afraid, so that he ran to hide himself among the trees. Then he saw a Giant approaching, dragging a sledge loaded with wood, and making straight for him, so that he could see nothing for it but to lie down just where he was. When the Giant came across him, he stood still and looked at the Prince for a little; then he took him up in his arms and carried him home to his house, and was exceedingly kind to him. He gave him to his wife, saying he had found this child in the wood, and she could have it to help her in the house. The old woman was greatly pleased, and began to fondle the Prince with the utmost delight. He stayed there with them, and was very willing and obedient to them in everything, while they grew kinder to him every day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1545'>One day the Giant took him round and showed him all his rooms except the parlour; this made the Prince curious to have a look into it, thinking there must be some very rare treasure there. So one day, when the Giant had gone into the forest, he tried to get into the parlour, and managed to get the door open half-way. Then he saw that some living creature moved inside and ran along the floor towards him and said something, which made him so frightened that he sprang back from the door and shut it again. As soon as the fright began to pass off he tried it again, for he thought it would be interesting to hear what it said; but things went just as before with him. He then got angry with himself, and, summoning up all his courage, tried it a third time, and opened the door of the room and stood firm. Then he saw that it was a big Dog, which spoke to him and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1548'>It is not said how long the Prince stayed with the Giant, but one day the latter came to him and said he would now take him over to the mainland out of the island, for he himself had no long time to live. He also thanked him for his good service, and told him to choose some-one of his possessions, for he would get whatever he wanted. Ring thanked him heartily, and said there was no need to pay him for his services, they were so little worth; but if he did wish to give him anything he would choose what was in the parlour. The Giant was taken by surprise, and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1549'>"There, you chose my old woman"s right hand; but I must not break my word."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1550'>Upon this he went to get the Dog, which came running with signs of great delight; but the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='delight;alarm;sign' adjectives='great;much;afraid' verbs='be;run;do;get;show;keep;go;come' valence='5.881875' arousal='4.41125' dominance='5.651875'>Prince</entity> was so much afraid of it that it was all he could do to keep from showing his alarm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1551'>After this the Giant accompanied him down to the sea, where he saw a stone boat which was just big enough to hold the two of them and the Dog. On reaching the mainland the Giant took a friendly farewell of Ring, and told him he might take possession of all that was in the island after he and his wife died, which would happen within two weeks from that time. The Prince thanked him for this and for all his other kindnesses, and the Giant returned home, while Ring went up some distance from the sea; but he did not know what land he had come to, and was afraid to speak to the Dog. After he had walked on in silence for a time the Dog spoke to him and said:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1555'>The Prince now began to be less afraid of the Dog. They came to the King and asked him to keep them all the winter, to which he agreed. When the King"s men saw the Dog they began to laugh at it, and make as if they would tease it; but when the Prince saw this he advised them not to do it, or they might have the worst of it. They replied that they didn"t care a bit what he thought.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1556'>After Ring had been with the King for some days the latter began to think there was a great deal in him, and esteemed him more than the others. The King, however, had a counsellor called Red, who became very jealous when he saw how much the King esteemed Ring; and one day he talked to him, and said he could not understand why he had so good an opinion of this stranger, who had not yet shown himself superior to other men in anything. The King replied that it was only a short time since he had come there. Red then asked him to send them both to cut down wood next morning, and see which of them could do most work. Snati-Snati heard this and told it to Ring, advising him to ask the King for two axes, so that he might have one in reserve if the first one got broken. Next morning the King asked Ring and Red to go and cut down trees for him, and both agreed. Ring got the two axes, and each went his own way; but when the Prince had got out into the wood Snati took one of the axes and began to hew along with him.

Ring thanked the King courteously for this and all his other kindnesses, and as soon as he had finished eating and drinking in the hall went off to sleep in his own room. Snati, however, asked permission to sleep in the Prince"s bed for that night, while the Prince should sleep where the Dog usually lay.

Ring instantly took the skin and burned it, and then shook the Prince, who was lying unconscious, until he woke up. The bridegroom then asked his name; he replied that he was called Ring, and was a King"s son.

In every case there was some little defect, which showed the genuine article was not yet found. So he came home again in very low spirits, for he had wanted very much to have a true Princess. One night there was a dreadful storm; it thundered and lightened and the rain streamed down in torrents. It was fearful!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1699'>There were once a Scotsman and an Englishman and an Irishman serving in the army together, who took it into their heads to run away on the first opportunity they could get. The chance came and they took it. They went on travelling for two days through a great forest, without food or drink, and without coming across a single house, and every night they had to climb up into the trees through fear of the wild beasts that were in the wood. On the second morning the Scotsman saw from the top of his tree a great castle far away. He said to himself that he would certainly die if he stayed in the forest without anything to eat but the roots of grass, which would not keep him alive very long. As soon, then, as he got down out of the tree he set off towards the castle, without so much as telling his companions that he had seen it at all; perhaps the hunger and want they had suffered had changed their nature so much that the one did not care what became of the other if he could save himself. He travelled on most of the day, so that it was quite late when he reached the castle, and to his great disappointment found nothing but closed doors and no smoke rising from the chimneys. He thought there was nothing for it but to die after all, and had lain down beside the wall, when he heard a window being opened high above him. At this he looked up, and saw the most beautiful woman he had ever set eyes on.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1700'>"Oh, it is Fortune that has sent you to me," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1701'>"It is indeed," said she. "What are you in need of, or what has sent you here?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1702'>"Necessity," said he. "I am dying for want of food and drink."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1703'>"Come inside, then," she said; "there is plenty of both here."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1704'>Accordingly he went in to where she was, and she opened a large room for him, where he saw a number of men lying asleep. She then set food before him, and after that showed him to the room where the others were. He lay down on one of the beds and fell sound asleep. And now we must go back to the two that he left behind him in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='go;leave' valence='5.555' arousal='3.81' dominance='5.41666666667'>the wood</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1705'>When nightfall and the time of the wild beasts came upon these, the Englishman happened to climb up into the very same tree on which the Scotsman was when he got a sight of the castle; and as soon as the day began to dawn and the Englishman looked to the four quarters of heaven, what did he see but the castle too! Off he went without saying a word to the Irishman, and everything happened to him just as it had done to the Scotsman.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1706'>The poor Irishman was now left all alone, and did not know where the others had gone to, so he just stayed where he was, very sad and miserable. When night came he climbed up into the same tree as the Englishman had been on the night before. As soon as day came he also saw the castle, and set out towards it; but when he reached it he could see no signs of fire or living being about it. Before long, however, he heard the window opened above his head, looked up, and beheld the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He asked if she would give him food and drink, and she answered kindly and heartily that she would, if he would only come inside. This he did very willingly, and she set before him food and drink that he had never seen the like of before. In the room there was a bed, with diamond rings hanging at every loop of the curtains, and everything that was in the room besides astonished him so much that he actually forgot that he was hungry. When she saw that he was not eating at all, she asked him what he wanted yet, to which he replied that he would neither eat nor drink until he knew who she was, or where she came from, or who had put her there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1707'>"I shall tell you that," said she. "I am an enchanted Princess, and my father has promised that the man who releases me from the spell shall have the third of his kingdom while he is alive, and the whole of it after he is dead, and marry me as well. If ever I saw a man who looked likely to do this, you are the one. I have been here for sixteen years now, and no one who ever came to the castle has asked me who I was, except yourself. Every other man that has come, so long as I have been here, lies asleep in the big room down there."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1708'>"Tell me, then," said the Irishman, "what is the spell that has been laid on you, and how you can be freed from it."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1712'>"I won"t," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1713'>The next moment the door came flying in, and those outside along with it. They knocked him down, and kicked him, and knelt on his body till it came to midnight; but as soon as the cock crew they all disappeared. The Irishman was little more than alive by this time. As soon as daylight appeared the Princess came, and found him lying full length on the floor, unable to speak a word. She took a bottle, rubbed him from head to foot with something from it, and thereupon he was as sound as ever; but after what he had got that night he was very unwilling to try it a second time. The <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end' adjectives='bad' verbs='entreat;be;say;give;stay' valence='6.03' arousal='4.032' dominance='5.439'>Princess</entity>, however, entreated him to stay, saying that the next night would not be so bad, and in the end he gave in and stayed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1714'>When it was getting near midnight he heard them ordering him to open the door, and there were three of them for every one that there had been the previous evening. He did not make the slightest movement to go out to them or to open the door, but before long they broke it up, and were in on top of him. They laid hold of him, and kept throwing him between them up to the ceiling, or jumping above him, until the cock crew, when they all disappeared. When day came the Princess went to the room to see if he was still alive, and taking the bottle put it to his nostrils, which soon brought him to himself. The first thing he said then was that he was a fool to go on getting himself killed for anyone he ever saw, and was determined to be off and stay there no longer, When the Princess learned his intention she entreated him to stay, reminding him that another night would free her from the spell. "Besides," she said, "if there is a single spark of life in you when the day comes, the stuff that is in this bottle will make you as sound as ever you were."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1715'>With all this the Irishman decided to stay; but that night there were three at him for every one that was there the two nights before, and it looked very unlikely that he would be alive in the morning after all that he got. When morning dawned, and the Princess came to see if he was still alive, she found him lying on the floor as if dead. She tried to see if there was breath in him, but could not quite make it out. Then she put her hand on his pulse, and found a faint movement in it. Accordingly she poured what was in the bottle on him, and before long he rose up on his feet, and was as well as ever he was. So that business was finished, and the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='spell;business' adjectives='' verbs='be;finish;free' valence='6.61714285714' arousal='4.19' dominance='5.94428571429'>Princess</entity> was freed from the spell.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1716'>The Princess then told the Irishman that she must go away for the present, but would return for him in a few days in a carriage drawn by four grey horses. He told her to "be aisy," and not speak like that to him. "I have paid dear for you for the last three nights," he said, "if I have to part with you now;" but in the twinkling of an eye she had disappeared. He did not know what to do with himself when he saw that she was gone, but before she went she had given him a little rod, with which he could, when he pleased, waken the men who had been sleeping there, some of them for sixteen years.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1717'>After being thus left alone, he went in and stretched himself on three chairs that were in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lad;chair' adjectives='little;fair-haired' verbs='be;do;stretch;leave;see;go;come' valence='5.558125' arousal='3.8375' dominance='5.53375'>the room</entity>, when what does he see coming in at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='lad;chair' adjectives='little;fair-haired' verbs='be;do;stretch;leave;see;go;come' valence='5.558125' arousal='3.8375' dominance='5.53375'>the door</entity> but a little fair-haired lad.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1722'>By this the Irishman knew that she had sent the lad to wait on him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1723'>Before long the Princess came with the carriage and four horses, and asked the lad whether his master was awake. He said that he wasn"t.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1724'>As soon as she was gone the lad took the pin out of his master"s coat, who instantly awoke.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1725'>"Yes," said he, "and she bade me tell you that if you don"t meet her at nine o"clock to-morrow you will never see her again."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1726'>He was very sorry when he heard this, and could not understand why the sleep should have fallen upon him just when she was coming. He decided, however, to go early to bed that night, in order to rise in time nest morning, and so he did. When it was getting near nine o"clock he went out to the garden to wait till she came, and the fair-haired lad along with him; but as soon as the lad got the chance he stuck the pin into his master"s coat again and he fell asleep as before. Precisely at nine o"clock came the Princess in the carriage with four horses, and asked the lad if his master had got up yet; but he said "No, he was asleep, just as he was the day before." "Dear! dear!" said the Princess, "I am sorry for him. Was the sleep he had last night not enough for him? Tell him that he will never see me here again; and here is a sword that you will give him in my name, and my blessing along with it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1727'>With this she went off, and as soon as she had gone the lad took the pin out of his master"s coat. He awoke instantly, and the first word he said was, "Have you seen her?" The lad said that he had, and there was the sword she had left for him. The Irishman was ready to kill <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shoulder;lad;glance;vexation;trace' adjectives='ready;sheer;fair-haired' verbs='leave;be;kill;give' valence='5.46642857143' arousal='4.12857142857' dominance='5.25285714286'>the lad</entity> out of sheer vexation, but when he gave a glance over his shoulder not a trace of the fair-haired lad was left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1728'>Being thus left all alone, he thought of going into the room where all the men were lying asleep, and there among the rest he found his two comrades who had deserted along with him. Then he remembered what the Princess had told him--that he had only to touch them with the rod she had given him and they would all awake; and the first he touched were his own comrades. They started to their feet at once, and he gave them as much silver and gold as they could carry when they went away. There was plenty to do before he got all the others wakened, for the two doors of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='other;door;plenty' adjectives='' verbs='be;get;waken;crowd;do' valence='5.698' arousal='3.649' dominance='5.554'>the castle</entity> were crowded with them all the day long.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1729'>The loss of the Princess, however, kept rankling in his mind day and night, till finally he thought he would go about the world to see if he could find anyone to give him news of her. So he took the best horse in the stable and set out. Three years he spent travelling through forests and wildernesses, but could find no one able to tell him anything of the Princess. At last he fell into so great despair that he thought he would put an end to his own life, and for this purpose laid hold of the sword that she had given him by the hands of the fair-haired lad; but on drawing it from its sheath he noticed that there was some writing on one side of the blade. He looked at this, and read there, "You will find me in the Blue Mountains." This made him take heart again, and he gave up the idea of killing himself, thinking that he would go on in hope of meeting some one who could tell him where the Blue Mountains were. After he had gone a long way without thinking where he was going, he saw at last a light far away, and made straight for it. On reaching it he found it came from a little house, and as soon as the man inside heard the noise of the horse"s feet he came out to see who was there. Seeing a stranger on horseback, he asked what brought him there and where he was going.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1730'>"I have lived here," said he, "for three hundred years, and all that time I have not seen a single human being but yourself."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1733'>The Irishman stayed there all night, and as soon as morning came rose to go.

"But I"ll tell you what," he said, "if there is such a place on earth at all, I have a brother who lives nine hundred miles from here, and he is sure to know where they are, if anyone in this world does." The Irishman answered that he could never go these nine hundred miles, for his horse was giving in already. "That doesn"t matter," said the old man; "I can do better than that. I have only to blow my whistle and you will be at my brother"s house before nightfall."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1749'>The Irishman knew that it was for himself she had been waiting so long, but he was unable to make any better of it, for he had no hope of reaching the Blue Mountains all his life.

First of all, though, they had to get a ladder of fourteen steps, to enable them to get on to the Eagle"s back, and there they piled up the meat as well as they could. Then the old man told the Irishman to mount, and to remember to throw a quarter of beef to her every time she looked round.

She began to eat out of it, and never stopped till she had finished it. The young fellows saw all this going on, but did not hear the two of them say anything to each other. They were astonished though at how greedily the Queen devoured the meat, and how much she ate of it, and were no longer surprised that she took so little when she sat at table with the King.

Soon after the planks in the floor sprang up as before, and the woman came up, dressed in white, with the iron belt and chain. The King saw at once that it was his own Queen, and immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastened to the belt. This was followed by such noises and crashings down in the earth that all the King"s Palace shook, so that no one expected anything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces.

The Giant wished her to marry him, but she refused; whereupon he shut her up by herself, and told her she would never get free until she consented. After a time she began to plan how to get her freedom, and at last told him that she would consent if he would allow her to visit her son on earth three days on end. This he agreed to, but put on her this iron belt and chain, the other end of which he fastened round his own waist, and the great noises that were heard when the King cut the chain must have been caused by the Giant"s falling down the underground passage when the chain gave way so suddenly. The Giant"s dwelling, indeed, was right under the Palace, and the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his death-throes.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1849'>"What a beautiful flower!" exclaimed the woman, and she kissed the red and yellow petals; but as she kissed them the flower burst open. It was a real tulip, such as one can see any day; but in the middle of the blossom, on the green velvety petals, sat a little girl, quite tiny, trim, and pretty. She was scarcely half a thumb in height; so they called her Thumbelina. An elegant polished walnut-shell served Thumbelina as a cradle, the blue petals of a violet were her mattress, and a rose-leaf her coverlid. There she lay at night, but in the day-time she used to play about on the table; here the woman had put a bowl, surrounded by a ring of flowers, with their stalks in water, in the middle of which floated a great tulip pedal, and on this Thumbelina sat, and sailed from one side of the bowl to the other, rowing herself with two white horse-hairs for oars.

The little fishes swimming about under the water had seen the toad quite plainly, and heard what she had said; so they put up their heads to see the little girl. When they saw her, they thought her so pretty that they were very sorry she should go down with the ugly toad to live. No; that must not happen.

She took off her sash, and tied one end round the butterfly; the other end she fastened to the leaf, so that now it glided along with her faster than ever.</paragraph>

Oh, dear! how terrified poor little Thumbelina was when the cockchafer flew off with her to the tree! But she was especially distressed on the beautiful white butterfly"s account, as she had tied him fast, so that if he could not get away he must starve to death. But the cockchafer did not trouble himself about that; he sat down with her on a large green leaf, gave her the honey out of the flowers to eat, and told her that she was very pretty, although she wasn"t in the least like a cockchafer. Later on, all the other cockchafers who lived in the same tree came to pay calls; they examined Thumbelina closely, and remarked, "Why, she has only two legs! How very miserable!"</paragraph>

There she sat and wept, because she was so ugly that the cockchafer would have nothing to do with her; and yet she was the most beautiful creature imaginable, so soft and delicate, like the loveliest rose-leaf.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1865'>The whole summer poor little Thumbelina lived alone in the great wood. She plaited a bed for herself of blades of grass, and hung it up under a clover-leaf, so that she was protected from the rain; she gathered honey from the flowers for food, and drank the dew on the leaves every morning. Thus the summer and autumn passed, but then came winter--the long, cold winter. All the birds who had sung so sweetly about her had flown away; the trees shed their leaves, the flowers died; the great clover-leaf under which she had lived curled up, and nothing remained of it but the withered stalk. She was terribly cold, for her clothes were ragged, and she herself was so small and thin. Poor little Thumbelina! she would surely be frozen to death. It began to snow, and every snow-flake that fell on her was to her as a whole shovelful thrown on one of us, for we are so big, and she was only an inch high. She wrapt herself round in a dead leaf, but it was torn in the middle and gave her no warmth; she was trembling with cold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1866'>Just outside the wood where she was now living lay a great corn-field. But the corn had been gone a long time; only the dry, bare stubble was left standing in the frozen ground. This made a forest for her to wander about in. All at once she came across the door of a field-mouse, who had a little hole under a corn-stalk. There the mouse lived warm and snug, with a store-room full of corn, a splendid kitchen and dining-room.

You must tell him all the prettiest stories you know."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1871'>But Thumbelina did not trouble her head about him, for he was only a mole. He came and paid them a visit in his black-velvet coat.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1873'>"His house is twenty times larger than mine; he possesses great knowledge, but he cannot bear the sun and the beautiful flowers, and speaks slightingly of them, for he has never seen them."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1874'>Thumbelina had to sing to him, so she sang "Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home!" and other songs so prettily that the mole fell in love with her; but he did not say anything, he was a very cautious man. A short time before he had dug a long passage through the ground from his own house to that of his neighbour; in this he gave the field-mouse and Thumbelina permission to walk as often as they liked. But he begged them not to be afraid of the dead bird that lay in the passage: it was a real bird with beak and feathers, and must have died a little time ago, and now laid buried just where he had made his tunnel. The mole took a piece of rotten wood in his mouth, for that glows like fire in the dark, and went in front, lighting them through the long dark passage. When they came to the place where the dead bird lay, the mole put his broad nose against the ceiling and pushed a hole through, so that the daylight could shine down. In the middle of the path lay a dead swallow, his pretty wings pressed close to his sides, his claws and head drawn under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of cold. Thumbelina was very sorry, for she was very fond of all little birds; they had sung and twittered so beautifully to her all through the summer. But the mole kicked him with his bandy legs and said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1875'>"Now he can"t sing any more! It must be very miserable to be a little bird! I"m thankful that none of my little children are; birds always starve in winter."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1876'>"Yes, you speak like a sensible man," said the field-mouse. "What has a bird, in spite of all his singing, in the winter-time? He must starve and freeze, and that must be very pleasant for him, I must say!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1877'>Thumbelina did not say anything; but when the other two had passed on she bent down to the bird, brushed aside the feathers from his head, and kissed his closed eyes gently. "Perhaps it was he that sang to me so prettily in the summer," she thought. "How much pleasure he did give me, dear little bird!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1878'>The mole closed up the hole again which let in the light, and then escorted the ladies home.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1879'>"Farewell, pretty little bird!" she said.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1882'>Next night she crept out again to him. There he was alive, but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment and look at Thumbelina, who was standing in front of him with a piece of rotten wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1883'>"Thank you, pretty little child!" said the swallow to her. "I am so beautifully warm! Soon I shall regain my strength, and then I shall be able to fly out again into the warm sunshine."</paragraph>

At last they came to warm lands; there the sun was brighter, the sky seemed twice as high, and in the hedges hung the finest green and purple grapes; in the woods grew oranges and lemons: the air was scented with myrtle and mint, and on the roads were pretty little children running about and playing with great gorgeous butterflies. But the swallow flew on farther, and it became more and more beautiful. Under the most splendid green trees besides a blue lake stood a glittering white-marble castle. Vines hung about the high pillars; there were many swallows" nests, and in one of these lived the swallow who was carrying Thumbelina.</paragraph>

So he took his golden crown from off his head and put it on hers, asking her her name, and if she would be his wife, and then she would be Queen of all the flowers. Yes! he was a different kind of husband to the son of the toad and the mole with the black-velvet coat. So she said "Yes" to the noble Prince. And out of each flower came a lady and gentleman, each so tiny and pretty that it was a pleasure to see them. Each brought Thumbelina a present, but the best of all was a beautiful pair of wings which were fastened on to her back, and now she too could fly from flower to flower. They all wished her joy, and the swallow sat above in his nest and sang the wedding march, and that he did as well as he could; but he was sad, because he was very fond of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='joy;nest;wedding' adjectives='fond;sad' verbs='be;do;wish;separate;sit;want;sing;swallow' valence='5.965' arousal='3.890625' dominance='5.72'>Thumbelina</entity> and did not want to be separated from her.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1909'>The Emperor"s Palace was the most splendid in the world, all made of priceless porcelain, but so brittle and delicate that you had to take great care how you touched it. In the garden were the most beautiful flowers, and on the loveliest of them were tied silver bells which tinkled, so that if you passed you could not help looking at the flowers. Everything in the Emperor"s garden was admirably arranged with a view to effect; and the garden was so large that even the gardener himself did not know where it ended. If you ever got beyond it, you came to a stately forest with great trees and deep lakes in it. The forest sloped down to the sea, which was a clear blue. Large ships could sail under the boughs of the trees, and in these trees there lived a Nightingale. She sang so beautifully that even the poor fisherman who had so much to do stood and listened when he came at night to cast his nets. "How beautiful it is!" he said; but he had to attend to his work, and forgot about the bird. But when she sang the next night and the fisherman came there again, he said the same thing, "How beautiful it is!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1938'>At the Palace everything was splendidly prepared. The porcelain walls and floors glittered in the light of many thousand gold lamps; the most gorgeous flowers which tinkled out well were placed in the corridors. There was such a hurrying and draught that all the bells jingled so much that one could not hear oneself speak. In the centre of the great hall where the Emperor sat was a golden perch, on which the Nightingale sat. The whole Court was there, and the little kitchenmaid was allowed to stand behind the door, now that she was a Court-cook. Everyone was dressed in his best, and everyone was looking towards the little grey bird to whom the Emperor nodded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1939'>The Nightingale sang so gloriously that the tears came into the Emperor"s eyes and ran down his cheeks. Then the Nightingale sang even more beautifully; it went straight to all hearts. The Emperor was so delighted that he said she should wear his gold slipper round her neck. But the Nightingale thanked him, and said she had had enough reward already. "I have seen tears in the Emperor"s eyes--that is a great reward. An Emperor"s tears have such power!" Then she sang again with her gloriously sweet voice.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1940'>"That is the most charming coquetry I have ever seen!" said all the ladies round. And they all took to holding water in their mouths that they might gurgle whenever anyone spoke to them. Then they thought themselves nightingales. Yes, the lackeys and chambermaids announced that they were pleased; which means a great deal, for they are the most difficult people of all to satisfy. In short, the Nightingale was a real success.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1941'>She had to stay at Court now; she had her own cage, and permission to walk out twice in the day and once at night.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1942'>She was given twelve servants, who each held a silken string which was fastened round her leg. There was little pleasure in flying about like this.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1947'>But it was not a book, but a little mechanical toy, which lay in a box--an artificial nightingale which was like the real one, only that it was set all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires. When it was wound up, it could sing the piece the real bird sang, and moved its tail up and down, and glittered with silver and gold. Round its neck was a little collar on which was written, "The Nightingale of the Emperor of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='neck;round;nothing;nightingale;emperor;collar' adjectives='little' verbs='write;be;compare' valence='5.5525' arousal='3.755' dominance='5.29583333333'>Japan</entity> is nothing compared to that of the Emperor of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='neck;round;nothing;nightingale;emperor;collar' adjectives='little' verbs='write;be;compare' valence='5.5525' arousal='3.755' dominance='5.29583333333'>China</entity>."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1951'>"It is not its fault!" said the bandmaster; "it keeps very good time and is quite after my style!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1952'>Then the artificial bird had to sing alone. It gave just as much pleasure as the real one, and then it was so much prettier to look at; it sparkled like bracelets and necklaces. Three-and-thirty times it sang the same piece without being tired. People would like to have heard it again, but the Emperor thought that the living Nightingale should sing now--but where was she? No one had noticed that she had flown out of the open window away to her green woods.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1953'>"What SHALL we do!" said the Emperor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1954'>And all the Court scolded, and said that the Nightingale was very ungrateful. "But we have still the best bird!" they said and the artificial bird had to sing again, and that was the thirty-fourth time they had heard the same piece. But they did not yet know it by heart; it was much too difficult. And the bandmaster praised the bird tremendously; yes, he assured them it was better than a real nightingale, not only because of its beautiful plumage and diamonds, but inside as well. "For see, my Lords and Ladies and your Imperial Majesty, with the real Nightingale one can never tell what will come out, but all is known about the artificial bird! You can explain it, you can open it and show people where the waltzes lie, how they go, and how one follows the other!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1955'>"That"s just what we think!" said everyone; and the bandmaster received permission to show the bird to the people the next Sunday. They should hear it sing, commanded the Emperor. And they heard it, and they were as pleased as if they had been intoxicated with tea, after the Chinese fashion, and they all said "Oh!" and held up their forefingers and nodded time. But the poor fishermen who had heard the real Nightingale said: "This one sings well enough, the tunes glide out; but there is something wanting--I don"t know what!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1956'>The real Nightingale was banished from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nightingale' adjectives='real' verbs='be;banish' valence='5.965' arousal='4.0975' dominance='5.695'>the kingdom</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1957'>The artificial bird was put on silken cushions by the Emperor"s bed, all the presents which it received, gold and precious stones, lay round it, and it was given the title of Imperial Night-singer, First from the left. For the Emperor counted that side as the more distinguished, being the side on which the heart is; the Emperor"s heart is also on the left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1958'>And the bandmaster wrote a work of twenty-five volumes about the artificial bird. It was so learned, long, and so full of the hardest Chinese words that everyone said they had read it and understood it; for once they had been very stupid about a book, and had been trampled under foot in consequence. So a whole year passed. The Emperor, the Court, and all the Chinese knew every note of the artificial bird"s song by heart. But they liked it all the better for this; they could even sing with it, and they did. The street boys sang "Tra-la-la-la-la, and the Emperor sang too sometimes. It was indeed delightful.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1959'>But one evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and the Emperor lay in bed listening to it, something in the bird went crack. Something snapped! Whir-r-r! all the wheels ran down and then the music ceased. The Emperor sprang up, and had his physician summoned, but what could HE do! Then the clockmaker came, and, after a great deal of talking and examining, he put the bird somewhat in order, but he said that it must be very seldom used as the works were nearly worn out, and it was impossible to put in new ones. Here was a calamity! Only once a year was the artificial bird allowed to sing, and even that was almost too much for it. But then the bandmaster made a little speech full of hard words, saying that it was just as good as before. And so, of course, it WAS just as good as before. So five years passed, and then a great sorrow came to the nation. The Chinese look upon their Emperor as everything, and now he was ill, and not likely to live it was said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1960'>Already a new Emperor had been chosen, and the people stood outside in the street and asked the First Lord how the old Emperor was. "P!" said he, and shook his head.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1961'>Cold and pale lay the Emperor in his splendid great bed; the whole Court believed him dead, and one after the other left him to pay their respects to the new Emperor. Everywhere in the halls and corridors cloth was laid down so that no footstep could be heard, and everything was still--very, very still. And nothing came to break the silence.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1962'>The Emperor longed for something to come and relieve the monotony of this deathlike stillness. If only someone would speak to him! If only someone would sing to him. Music would carry his thoughts away, and would break the spell lying on him. The moon was streaming in at the open window; but that, too, was silent, quite silent.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1963'>"Music! music!" cried the Emperor. "You little bright golden bird, sing! do sing! I gave you gold and jewels; I have hung my gold slipper round your neck with my own hand--sing! do sing!" But the bird was silent. There was no one to wind it up, and so it could not sing. And all was silent, so terribly silent!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1964'>All at once there came in at the window the most glorious burst of song. It was the little living Nightingale, who, sitting outside on a bough, had heard the need of her Emperor and had come to sing to him of comfort and hope. And as she sang the blood flowed quicker and quicker in the Emperor"s weak limbs, and life began to return.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1965'>"Thank you, thank you!" said the Emperor. "You divine little bird! I know you. I chased you from my kingdom, and you have given me life again! How can I reward you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1966'>"You have done that already!" said the Nightingale. "I brought tears to your eyes the first time I sang. I shall never forget that. They are jewels that rejoice a singer"s heart. But now sleep and get strong again; I will sing you a lullaby." And the Emperor fell into a deep, calm sleep as she sang.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1967'>The sun was shining through the window when he awoke, strong and well. None of his servants had come back yet, for they thought he was dead. But the Nightingale sat and sang to him.</paragraph>

I will sing of joy, and of sorrow; I will sing of the evil and the good which lies hidden from you. The little singing-bird flies all around, to the poor fisherman"s hut, to the farmer"s cottage, to all those who are far away from you and your Court. I love your heart more than your crown, though that has about it a brightness as of something holy. Now I will sing to you again; but you must promise me one thing----"</paragraph>

As he sailed there came upon him so thick a mist that he altogether lost his bearings, but after long trouble he found land. There he laid his ship to, and went on shore all alone. After walking for some time he came to a forest, into which he went a little way and stopped. Then he heard sweet music from a harp, and went in the direction of the sound until he came to a clearing, and there he saw three women, one of whom sat on a golden chair, and was beautifully and grandly dressed; she held a harp in her hands, and was very sorrowful. The second was also finely dressed, but younger in appearance, and also sat on a chair, but it was not so grand as the first one"s. The third stood beside them, and was very pretty to look at; she had a green cloak over her other clothes, and it was easy to see that she was maid to the other two.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1980'>After the King had looked at them for a little he went forward and saluted them. The one that sat on the golden chair asked him who he was and where he was going; and he told her all the story--how he was a king, and had lost his queen, and was now on his way to Hetland the Good, to ask the Queen of that country in marriage. She answered that fortune had contrived this wonderfully, for pirates had plundered Hetland and killed the King, and she had fled from the land in terror, and had come hither after great trouble, and she was the very person he was looking for, and the others were her daughter and maid. The King immediately asked her hand; she gladly received his proposal and accepted him at once. Thereafter they all set out, and made their way to the ship; and after that nothing is told of their voyage until the King reached his own country.

Hermod told her straight and plain that he would not do so, at which the Queen grew terribly angry, and said that in that case neither should he have Hadvor, for she would now lay this spell on him, that he should go to a desert island and there be a lion by day and a man by night.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1994'>"First and foremost," said Olof, "you must get a wide cloak to wear over your other clothes, when you are put into the mound. The Giant"s ghost will walk after you are both left together in there, and he will have two dogs along with him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1995'>The mound was all ready now, and the Giant laid in it, and into it Hadvor also had to go without being allowed to make any defence. After they were both left there everything happened just as Olof had said. The prince became a Giant again, and asked Hadvor to cut the pieces out of his legs for the dogs; but she refused until he told her that Hermod was in a desert island, which she could not reach unless she took the skin off the soles of his feet and made shoes out of that; with these shoes she could travel both on land and sea. This Hadvor now did, and the Giant then let her get up on his shoulders to get out of the mound. As she sprang out he caught hold of her cloak; but she had taken care to let it lie loose on her shoulders, and so escaped.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1996'>She now made her way down to the sea, to where she knew there was the shortest distance over to the island in which Hermod was. This strait she easily crossed, for the shoes kept her up. On reaching the island she found a sandy beach all along by the sea, and high cliffs above. Nor could she see any way to get up these, and so, being both sad at heart and tired with the long journey, she lay down and fell asleep. As she slept she dreamed that a tall woman came to her and said, "I know that you are Princess Hadvor, and are searching for Hermod. He is on this island; but it will be hard for you to get to him if you have no one to help you, for you cannot climb the cliffs by your own strength. I have therefore let down a rope, by which you will be able to climb up; and as the island is so large that you might not find Hermod"s dwelling-place so easily, I lay down this clew beside you. You need only hold the end of the thread, and the clew will run on before and show you the way. I also lay this belt beside you, to put on when you awaken; it will keep you from growing faint with hunger."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1997'>The woman now disappeared, and Hadvor woke, and saw that all her dream had been true. The rope hung down from the cliff, and the clew and belt lay beside her. The belt she put on, the rope enabled her to climb up the cliff, and the clew led her on till she came to the mouth of a cave, which was not very big. She went into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='couch' adjectives='low' verbs='go;see;lay;creep' valence='5.08375' arousal='4.065' dominance='4.9625'>the cave</entity>, and saw there a low couch, under which she crept and lay down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='1998'>When evening came she heard the noise of footsteps outside, and became aware that the lion had come to the mouth of the cave, and shook itself there, after which she heard a man coming towards the couch. She was sure this was Hermod, because she heard him speaking to himself about his own condition, and calling to mind Hadvor and other things in the old days. Hadvor made no sign, but waited till he had fallen asleep, and then crept out and burned the lion"s skin, which he had left outside. Then she went back into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='meeting' adjectives='joyful' verbs='go;waken;have' valence='5.69285714286' arousal='4.22857142857' dominance='5.46285714286'>the cave</entity> and wakened <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='meeting' adjectives='joyful' verbs='go;waken;have' valence='5.69285714286' arousal='4.22857142857' dominance='5.46285714286'>Hermod</entity>, and they had a most joyful meeting.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1999'>In the morning they talked over their plans, and were most at a loss to know how to get out of the island. Hadvor told Hermod her dream, and said she suspected there was some one in the island who would be able to help them. Hermod said he knew of a Witch there, who was very ready to help anyone, and that the only plan was to go to her. So they went to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='s;mainland;son' adjectives='young' verbs='help;get;cave;ask;go;find' valence='5.70916666667' arousal='4.19583333333' dominance='5.47583333333'>Witch</entity>"s cave, and found her there with her fifteen young sons, and asked her to help them to get to the mainland.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2000'>"There are other things easier than that," said she, "for the Giant that was buried will be waiting for you, and will attack you on the way, as he has turned himself into a big whale.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2001'>They thanked her greatly for her help and advice, and set out from the island, but on the way they saw a huge fish coming towards them, with great splashing and dashing of waves. They were sure of what it was, and thought they had as good reason as ever they would have to call on the Witch, and so they did. The next minute they saw coming after them another huge whale, followed by fifteen smaller ones. All of these swam past the boat and went on to meet the whale. There was a fierce battle then, and the sea became so stormy that it was not very easy to keep the boat from being filled by the waves.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='2002'>Now the story goes back to the King"s hall, where strange things had happened in the meantime.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='2003'>One evening, however, while they all sat dull and down-hearted, in came Hermod with a sword by his side, and saluted the King, who received him with the greatest joy, as if he had come back from the dead.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2008'>There were once upon a time five-and twenty tin-soldiers--all brothers, as they were made out of the same old tin spoon. Their uniform was red and blue, and they shouldered their guns and looked straight in front of them. The first words that they heard in this world, when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off, were: "Hurrah, tin-soldiers!" This was exclaimed by a little boy, clapping his hands; they had been given to him because it was his birthday, and now he began setting them out on the table. Each soldier was exactly like the other in shape, except just one, who had been made last when the tin had run short; but there he stood as firmly on his one leg as the others did on two, and he is the one that became famous.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2009'>There were many other playthings on the table on which they were being set out, but the nicest of all was a pretty little castle made of cardboard, with windows through which you could see into the rooms. In front of the castle stood some little trees surrounding a tiny mirror which looked like a lake. Wax swans were floating about and reflecting themselves in it. That was all very pretty; but the most beautiful thing was a little lady, who stood in the open doorway. She was cut out of paper, but she had on a dress of the finest muslin, with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders, fastened in the middle with a glittering rose made of gold paper, which was as large as her head. The little lady was stretching out both her arms, for she was a Dancer, and was lifting up one leg so high in the air that the Tin-soldier couldn"t find it anywhere, and thought that she, too, had only one leg.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2010'>"That"s the wife for me!" he thought; "but she is so grand, and lives in a castle, whilst I have only a box with four-and-twenty others.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2011'>When the night came all the other tin-soldiers went into their box, and the people of the house went to bed. Then the toys began to play at visiting, dancing, and fighting. The tin-soldiers rattled in their box, for they wanted to be out too, but they could not raise the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the slate-pencil ran about the slate; there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk to them, in poetry too! The only two who did not stir from their places were the Tin-soldier and the little Dancer. She remained on tip-toe, with both arms outstretched; he stood steadfastly on his one leg, never moving his eyes from her face.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2012'>The clock struck twelve, and crack! off flew the lid of the snuff-box; but there was no snuff inside, only a little black imp--that was the beauty of it.</paragraph>

That was a terrible fall, I can tell you! He landed on his head with his leg in the air, his gun being wedged between two paving-stones.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2017'>The nursery-maid and the little boy came down at once to look for him, but, though they were so near him that they almost trod on him, they did not notice him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2020'>So they made a little boat out of newspaper, put the Tin-soldier in it, and made him sail up and down the gutter; both the boys ran along beside him, clapping their hands. What great waves there were in the gutter, and what a swift current! The paper-boat tossed up and down, and in the middle of the stream it went so quick that the Tin-soldier trembled; but he remained steadfast, showed no emotion, looked straight in front of him, shouldering his gun. All at once the boat passed under a long tunnel that was as dark as his box had been.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2021'>"Where can I be coming now?" he wondered. "Oh, dear! This is the black imp"s fault! Ah, if only the little lady were sitting beside me in the boat, it might be twice as dark for all I should care!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2026'>But the current became swifter and stronger.

On went the boat, the poor Tin-soldier keeping himself as stiff as he could: no one should say of him afterwards that he had flinched. The boat whirled three, four times round, and became filled to the brim with water: it began to sink! The Tin-soldier was standing up to his neck in water, and deeper and deeper sank the boat, and softer and softer grew the paper; now the water was over his head. He was thinking of the pretty little Dancer, whose face he should never see again, and there sounded in his ears, over and over again:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2029'>"Forward, forward, soldier bold!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2030'>Death"s before thee, grim and cold!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2031'>The paper came in two, and the soldier fell--but at that moment he was swallowed by a great fish.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2032'>Oh! how dark it was inside, even darker than in the tunnel, and it was really very close quarters! But there the steadfast little Tin-soldier lay full length, shouldering his gun.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2033'>Up and down swam the fish, then he made the most dreadful contortions, and became suddenly quite still. Then it was as if a flash of lightning had passed through him; the daylight streamed in, and a voice exclaimed, "Why, here is the little Tin-soldier!" The fish had been caught, taken to market, sold, and brought into the kitchen, where the cook had cut it open with a great knife. She took up the soldier between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room, where everyone wanted to see the hero who had been found inside a fish; but the Tin-soldier was not at all proud. They put him on the table, and--no, but what strange things do happen in this world!--the Tin-soldier was in the same room in which he had been before! He saw the same children, and the same toys on the table; and there was the same grand castle with the pretty little Dancer. She was still standing on one leg with the other high in the air; she too was steadfast. That touched the Tin-soldier, he was nearly going to shed tin-tears; but that would not have been fitting for a soldier. He looked at her, but she said nothing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2034'>All at once one of the little boys took up the Tin-soldier, and threw him into the stove, giving no reasons; but doubtless the little black imp in the snuff-box was at the bottom of this too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2035'>There the Tin-soldier lay, and felt a heat that was truly terrible; but whether he was suffering from actual fire, or from the ardour of his passion, he did not know. All his colour had disappeared; whether this had happened on his travels or whether it was the result of trouble, who can say? He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt that he was melting; but he remained steadfast, with his gun at his shoulder. Suddenly a door opened, the draught caught up the little Dancer, and off she flew like a sylph to the Tin-soldier in the stove, burst into flames--and that was the end of her! Then the Tin-soldier melted down into a little lump, and when next morning the maid was taking out the ashes, she found him in the shape of a heart. There was nothing left of the little Dancer but her gilt rose, burnt as black as a cinder.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2089'>There was once a Darning-needle who thought herself so fine that she believed she was an embroidery-needle.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2090'>"It is all right!" said the Fingers, seizing her round the waist.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2091'>"Look, I am coming with my train!" said the Darning-needle as she drew a long thread after her; but there was no knot at the end of the thread.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2094'>"Now she is good for nothing!" said the Fingers; but they had to hold her tight while the cook dropped some sealing-wax on the needle and stuck it in the front of her dress.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2095'>"Now I am a breast-pin!" said the Darning-needle. "I always knew I should be promoted. When one is something, one will become something!" And she laughed to herself; you can never see when a Darning-needle is laughing. Then she sat up as proudly as if she were in a State coach, and looked all round her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2096'>"May I be allowed to ask if you are gold?" she said to her neighbour, the Pin. "You have a very nice appearance, and a peculiar head; but it is too small! You must take pains to make it grow, for it is not everyone who has a head of sealing-wax." And so saying the Darning-needle raised herself up so proudly that she fell out of the dress, right into the sink which the cook was rinsing out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2097'>"Now I am off on my travels!" said the Darning-needle. "I do hope I sha"n"t get lost!" She did indeed get lost.</paragraph>

Don"t think so much about yourself, or you will be knocked against a stone. There floats a bit of newspaper. What is written on it is long ago forgotten, and yet how proud it is!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2102'>One day something thick lay near her which glittered so brightly that the Darning-needle thought it must be a diamond. But it was a bit of bottle-glass, and because it sparkled the Darning-needle spoke to it, and gave herself out as a breast-pin.</paragraph>

The outside one, the Thumb, was short and fat; he was outside the rank, and had only one bend in his back, and could only make one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man that he was no longer any use as a soldier. Dip-into-everything, the second finger, dipped into sweet things as well as sour things, pointed to the sun and the moon, and guided the pen when they wrote. Longman, the third, looked at the others over his shoulder. Goldband, the fourth, had a gold sash round his waist; and little Playman did nothing at all, and was the more proud. There was too much ostentation, and so I came away."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2112'>One day two street-urchins were playing and wading in the gutter, picking up old nails, pennies, and such things. It was rather dirty work, but it was a great delight to them.</paragraph>

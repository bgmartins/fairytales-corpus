	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>It has been to me a matter of surprise that no  collection has been made and adapted to the reading  of children of the old delightful English folk tales  and traditionary stories that exist, scattered up and  down in all manner of places.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'>We have had for their delectation numerous  editions of the French tales of Perault and the  Countess D"Aulnoy, and the German stories ot  Grimm, but our own native springs have been  neglected. There is a singular perversity in the  English character  that it will seek abroad, and  and value what is foreign, and neglect and disparage  what is native. This, which has blighted our drama,  our music, our architecture, affects even our nursery  literature. Recently, indeed, Mr. Jacobs has issued  his English Fairy Tales in two volumes,  a first and  second series,  but he has taken mostly modern  folk tales, and he has not gone to the ancient sources,  whence may be drawn some of the best old English  fairy tales.

The bare bones that I have  attempted to reclothe with flesh are accessible  to antiquaries and bibliographers. I give them  references where to find these. But this book is  not written for them, but for children, be it well  understood ; and it is written by one who as a  a child was greedy after fairy tales, and is not  ashamed to add, loves them dearly still. If I have  woven two and even more tales into one, or in-  troduced episodes from others, then I have used that  licence which belongs to every old woman who tells  stories to children. The incidents in fairy tales are  like kaleidoscopic particles, ever entering into new  combinations. If English children like native-grown  tales, then let me assure them <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tale;child' adjectives='wherewith;native-grown' verbs='exhaust;supply;assure;let;have;be' valence='5.90166666667' arousal='4.03166666667' dominance='5.64333333333'>the spring</entity> is not  exhausted ; I have more wherewith to supply them.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='409'>Note.  The old English story of " Catskin," which exists  in ballad form, has been driven out by the French tale of  "Cinderella." The latter*is a very g-ood story, and it was ver}"  well told by Perault. In some points the English tale is preferable.  The English story has relation also to Perault"s " Peau d"Ane."  In German the series are those of " Aschenplittel " and "* Allerlei-  rauch." The catskin in the English story is an ass"s hide in  Perault"s, and a coat of coarse hair in the German. The story is  known throughout Europe. In the Eng-lish tale there is no g-lass  slipper dropped. In connection with this element, I may refer to  Rhodope, who became Queen of Egypt by dropping" her slipper  (Strabo, xxii. 808 ; ^lian, Hist. var. xiii. 33). The English  ballad, which is without poetic merit, has been several times  reprinted. It was printed in Aldermary Churchyard about 1720.  For a full account of the story and its ramifications and variants,  see J. S. Moore, The Pictorial Book of Ballads, 1849, vol. ii. p. 145 ;  and still fuller in <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='variant;s;cinderella;p.' adjectives='fuller' verbs='print' valence='5.29666666667' arousal='4.09666666667' dominance='5.99666666667'>A.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='776'>Note.  The story of the Golden Bull is based on an old English  ballad of the same title, which is merely a folk-tale thrown into  wretched jingling- rhyme. The full title is "The Golden Bull, or  the Garland of Love"s Craftiness." The date of the ballad is the  middle or end of last century. It was printed in Boro" Churchyard.  In several points it resembles Catskin. Not only in both are there  the three suits of garments, but in the Golden Bull the prince falls  sick. In Catskin sickness is feigned. I have altered the conclu-  sion in order to avoid the too close similarity, and have also a  little amplified the middle of the tale with the appearances of the  lady emerging from the bull. One characteristic feature belonging  to the opening of the story, which classifies it with a whole series  of folk-tales, for very good reasons I have had to modify.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='957'>Note.  The story of Southernwood is based, but based only,  on the ballad of Tarn Lin. We have this only in Scottish form,  but Tommy o" Lynn is well known all over England and the  subject of humorous song-s. Moreover, the story of his capture  by fairies and his release is common to all peoples. The maid  and the gold ball I have worked in from another tale, to which it  does not properly belong ; the real story concerns the loss of the  golden ball, and the sentence of the maid to execution unless it  be produced. I have also worked in the universally known story  of the fairy changeling, common in Ireland, in Scotland, in  Wales, and in Cornwall. In folk-tales the same elements are  worked up again and again, and this is my sole justification for  the hotch-potch of a story, Southernwood. For Tam Lin see  Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, No. 39. For The  Golden Ball, see appendix to Henderson"s Folklore of the Xorthern  Counties^ ed. 1866, and Jacobs" More English Fairy Tales. I must  admit that the bit of ballad, p. 91, is not a genuine old fragment.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1159'>is very well known still among- the peasantry of England, and is  sung- to a fine ancient melody. It is known well also in Scotland.  A snatch of the ballad occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher"s play,  ""The Knight of the Burning Pestle," that was printed in 1613.  The story is perhaps derived from the older " Ballad of Sir Gawain"s  Marriage." See concerning it Professor Child"s English and  Scottish Ballads, the new edition, No. no. The folk-tale I have  combined with it is one I remember being told as a child.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1160'>In Roger of Wendover"s Floivers of History, written in 1235, is  the story of King Edward, son of Alfred the Great, and the  Shepherd"s Daughter. Their son was the famous King Athelstan,  who succeeded Edward in 924. It is possible that the ballad may  have been based on this story.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1299'>Note.  This is the story on which the old Eng-Hsh ballad of  " The Turkey Factor " runs. I have somewhat altered the conclu-  sion, as the final portion of the ballad is rather inexplicable.  The Tale of the Thankful Dead is very widely spread. A very  similar story is found in Wolf"s Detitsche Hausmdrchen. 1851, p.  243. A variant in the Zeitschrift filr deutsche 3Iythologie, 1855,  from the Odenwald (ii. 374), where the merchant is English.  Another in Meier"s Deutsche Volksmdrchen mis Schivahen, 1852  (No. 42), where also the merchant is Eng-lish. A version in  Strapparola"s NottipiacevoU, Venice, 1573. It is singular that in  the German versions, as in the English, the end should be  similar. It is properly this :</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1300'>The merchant or factor, when cast on the desert island, is  assisted by a mysterious grey man (in one form a black man), who  brings him to the mainland on condition that he is given the  firstborn. At the covenanted time he comes for the babe, and the  factor yields it up, to receive it back again, and then the black or  grey man reveals the fact that he is the ghost of the dead. K.  Simrock, Der giite Gerhardf, conjectures that this is a corrupt form  of an old pagan mjth, that Odin or Wuotan is the grey man, who  rewards the merchant for having been merciful to the dead, and  that the offering of the child is a relic of human sacrifice. This is  extremely probable, the original significance having been lost,  and by this means the later part of the story got into confusion.</paragraph>

It is always sung to the melody to which "The Frog and the Crow "  is set in Mr. W. Crane"s The Bahys Opera. A similar ballad is  found in Scotland, " Bonnie Annie " ; it is given by Kinloch, but is  more imperfect than the English form of the ballad. In the story  I have based on it, all the first part is new ; for obvious reasons I  haVe been unable to follow the ballad exactly  that is to say, for  reasons obvious to all who are acquainted with the ballad.</paragraph>

This is based on the old English ballad of "* The Strange  Lives of two Young- Princes in England," which was printed in  A Collection of Old Ballads^ 17251 vol. iii. The earlier part is so  distinctly founded on the story of Havelock the Dane and Argentile,  that I have somewhat altered it, as this latter story is given in  this collection. After the flight of the damsel, then the story no  longer bears any resemblance to that of Havelock. The ballad  as it comes to us is not in its original shape, but is a rewriting of  a much earlier one, in the reign of Elizabeth or James I. The  collector of the Old Ballads supposed that this composition was  founded on the story of Raymond Fitzgerald, the conqueror of  Ireland, who married Basilia, sister of Richard Strongbow, in  1 174. But there is nothing save the name to favour this  hypothesis.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='2036'>Note.  The story of Havelock is one of the most ancient of our  sagas, so ancient that it has passed away out of our nurseries,  and has been clean forgotten. It exists, however, in several ver-  sions. The old English lay of Havelock is one of the few poems that  have happily been recovered, after having long been given up as  lost. It was at length discovered by accident in a manuscript be-  longing to the Bodleian Library, which had been catalogued as a  Collection of Lives of the Saints. It was edited by Sir F. Madden,  in 1828, for the Roxburghe Club, and has since been re-edited by the  Rev. Walter W. Skeat for the Early English Text Society, 1868. A  French " Lai de Aveloc" exists, which was composed within the first  half of the twelfth century. The story was abridged by Gaimar in  his English Chronicle, and he wrote between 1141 and 1151.  There are numerous other references to the tale in other historians,  all of which will be found in Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='reference;historian;s;tale;edition;mr.' adjectives='other;numerous' verbs='be;find' valence='5.68166666667' arousal='3.47333333333' dominance='5.67666666667'>Skeat</entity>"s edition.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2041'>The story varies very considerably in the several versions, and  Hav^elock"s wife is variously called Arg-entile or Goldburgh, and  the several kings who are named in the tale also differ.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='2042'>That Havelock was an historical character is more than  probable, and Mr. Skeat fixes his date as somewhere in the 6th  century. Mr. Haigh in his Congiiest of Britain by the Saxons,  1861, gives these dates : Havelock"s father slain, a.d. 4S7 ; his  expedition to Denmark, a.d. 507 ; his reign in East Anglia, a.d.  511-5.31 or a little later. The story was converted into a ballad by  Warner in his Albion"s England, published in 1586 ; or what is more  probable is that he took a current ballad and rewrote and spoiled  it. That was what rhymesters did at that period. The Scots  preserved the early ballads intact, our English rhymesters  vulgarised them in rewriting them, to suit the false taste of the  day, and so the old ballads on which they were based got  lost.</paragraph>

This lai has been unfortunately lost. One incident  in it I have had to modify or alter, for reasons which will be obvious  to any one who reads the original. There are two versions of the  story of the coming of the Northmen to England : one is given  in the story of King Edmund, the other is told here. What is  certain is that the Danes began to come in Ethelred"s time, when  Edmund was king in East Anglia, and Ella was king in North-  umberland. The King of Northumberland had been Osbrith, but  he had been deposed, and Ella, who was not of royal birth, set up  in his place. The Danes arrived in East Anglia in 866, passed  the winter there, and next year crossed the Humber into what is  now Yorkshire, and was then part of the kingdom of Northumbria.  They took York in the same year, 867 ; there actually was then a  great battle fought, and King Osbrith the dethroned and Ella  the usurper made up their differences and fought the Danes under  its walls, were defeated, and both slain. Consequently, we can fix  the date of the events in this story with a nicety, and we know  that both <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='story;character;osbrith;tradition;nicety;date;event' adjectives='real;historical' verbs='be;fix;base;know' valence='6.423125' arousal='3.725' dominance='5.740625'>Ella</entity> and Osbrith were real historical characters, and  that this story is based on historical traditions.</paragraph>

It is one of the many Norman-  French lays based on Celtic tradition and myth, that delighted the  kings and nobles of the court of the Plantagenets. This story  has a clear family relation to that of Thomas of Ercildoun ; only in  the latter, Thomas escapes from Fairyland, and in this lai of  Desideratus, the hero returns to it for ever. It is moreover the  same as Marie"s Lai of Lanval and as that of Gruelan in Le  Grand d"Aussi. See Ritson"s Metrical Roviances, i. 170. I have  taken a few liberties with the tale.

	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='2912'>Note.  The story of Sir Grey, Sir Graham, and Sir Greyskin is  a combination of the metrical romance of " Sir Eger, Sir Graham,  and Sir Graysteel," which is imperfect, and of which one copy alone  remains, and also of a story given by Gervase of Tilbury in Otia  Iinperalia, written in 121 1. The story of Sir Eger and the rest was  very popular in the early part of the sixteenth century, as is  evident from the manner in which it is mentioned in the Complaynt  of Scotland, first published in 1549. In the metrical romance, of which  Ellis gives a summary, Sir Graysteel is not a ghostly knight ; he  is actually killed by Sir Graham. I hope that I have not  offended the purists by identifying him with the ghostly knight of  Gervase.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='3230'>Note.  This is one of the noblest of mediseval romances. On it  Meyerbeer based his opera of " Roberto il Diavolo." It has not  hitherto been adapted for children because of a difficulty at the  beg-inning- to which objection might be taken. An attempt has been  made in this version to g-et over the difficulty. The tale occurs in  an early French metrical romance of the thirteenth century. There  was also a mediseval mystery play on the same topic. The story  was turned into prose and published at L)-ons in 1496. The  English edition was by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='edition' adjectives='' verbs='be' valence='5.74' arousal='3.61' dominance='5.155'>Wynkyn de Worde</entity>, about 1490.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='3231'>It has been supposed that there is some sort of historical basis  for the story. Robert has been supposed to have been the son ot  one Aubert, first Duke of Neustria under Pepin, the father of  Charlemagne, about 751. This Aubert had a wife named Inde,  sister of the Duke of Burgundy, by whom he had a son called  Robert, who received the bad nickname on account of the enor-  mities committed by him in the Forest of Rouveray. Robert was  the father of Richard Sans-peur, who is also a hero of romance.  The stories of both were incorporated inLes Chro7iiques et excellents  Faits des Dues, Princes, Barotis et Seigneurs de la 7whle Diichd de  Nonnandie," <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='barotis;story;princes;due;chro7iique;inle' adjectives='' verbs='be;incorporate' valence='5.94' arousal='3.51' dominance='4.9525'>Paris</entity>, s.a.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='20'>It has been to me a matter of surprise that no  collection has been made and adapted to the reading  of children of the old delightful English folk tales  and traditionary stories that exist, scattered up and  down in all manner of places.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='21'>u"We have had for their delectation numerous  editions of the French tales of Perault and the  Countess D"Aulnoy, and the German stories ot  Grimm, but our own native springs have been  neglected. There is a singular perversity in the  English character  that it will seek abroad, and  and value what is foreign, and neglect and disparage  what is native. This, which has blighted our drama,  our music, our architecture, affects even our nursery  literature. Recently, indeed, Mr. Jacobs has issued  his English Fairy Tales in two volumes,  a first and  second series,  but he has taken mostly modern  folk tales, and he has not gone to the ancient sources,  whence may be drawn some of the best old English  fairy tales. I now give English children an instal- "</paragraph>

The bare bones that I have  attempted to reclothe with flesh are accessible  to antiquaries and bibliographers. I give them  references where to find these. But this book is  not written for them, but for children, be it well  understood ; and it is written by one who as a  a child was greedy after fairy tales, and is not  ashamed to add, loves them dearly still. If I have  woven two and even more tales into one, or in-  troduced episodes from others, then I have used that  licence which belongs to every old woman who tells  stories to children. The incidents in fairy tales are  like kaleidoscopic particles, ever entering into new  combinations. If English children like native-grown  tales, then let me assure them the spring is not  exhausted ; I have more wherewith to supply them.</paragraph>

So the nobleman became  more morose, and showed great dislike to his  youngest child, because she was a girl and not a  boy. So from bad words he went to bad acts. He  did not even kiss her, or speak to her kindly.  Nevertheless, he provided that she should be well  instructed, and he gave her dresses suitable to her  rank.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='111'>At a very early age he fulfilled his resolution to  have her sent away. She was confided to one who  had ever been a good friend to her mother in the  country far away from home, and her father never  went to see her, never seemed to care when was her  birthday ; he regarded her as an encumbrance, for  whom he was obliged to pay money to have her  properly dressed and fed and educated.</paragraph>

The time was winter,  and the snow lay on the ground, and but for her  warm dress of catskins she would have perished.</paragraph>

She wondered at seeing one dressed all in  fur seated on the steps. The lady asked what  manner of person or animal that was. Then the  girl stood up and took off her cap, and her beautiful  brown hair fell down over her shoulders, and the  lady saw that this was no beast, but a girl.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='161'>u"It fell out that the king came to the town, and  there was accordingly much entertainment given to  him, and the mayor and corporation announced  that they would have three splendid balls in the  Guild Hall on three consecutive nights for the  entertainment of the king. The nobleman"s son  was invited, and prepared to go. "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='163'>When the lady heard this, she was very angry,  and she had a ladle in her hand, and with it she  struck the girl on the back with such force that  she broke the ladle in two. Thereupon, crying,  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='thereupon;kitchen;barn' adjectives='' verbs='cry;run;hide'>Catskin</entity> ran out of the kitchen, and hid herself in  the barn.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='171'>Then, laughing heartily, he rode away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='172'>u"No sooner was he gone than Catskin put off her  fur dress, washed herself, combed out her beautiful  brown hair, that she wore under a cap from which  hung seven cats" tails, and clothed herself in fine  linen and lace, and a beautiful silken dress, the  colour of the blue sky in spring, and she decorated  her hair with daisies. And when thus dressed, she  tripped away to the town, and was admitted into  the great hall, and danced that evening with the  young nobleman. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='173'>He did not know who she was, but he thought  that she was the most beautiful girl he had ever  seen.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='179'>Now, during the dance, very nimbly, Catskin  slipped away, and hastened over the fields back to  the castle, went into the barn, and threw off and  concealed her silken dress. She covered herself  again with catskins, and put over her hair the  fur cap with the seven pussy-cat tails ; and was</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='183'>as comical an object as ever. Very soon also her  face and hands were grimy, for the cook was going  to bake, and he made her go into the oven, and  brush out all the ashes that were there. You may  believe me, there was great talk among the servants  about the beautiful lady in the sky-blue silk who  had danced at the ball. For there had been the  serving-men of the young nobleman there, who had  attended on the guests, and they told how their  master had danced with this beautiful and unknown  lady.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='184'>Some laughed at Catskin and said to her, " Hey,  Catskin ! how would you have liked to be there ?  That would have been rare sport to see you with  your cat tails flying about. I warrant the king  would have led you out to dance the hay." ^</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='185'>" Very like he would," answered Catskin. Whereat  all fell a-laughing more loudly than ever.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='186'>Then the noble mistress of the house came into  the kitchen, and the girl went before her, and said,  " Dear lady, may I attend the ball this night ? The  servants say that the king will dance the hay with  me if I go." Thereat the lady was so wroth and  shamed at the foolishness of the scullion girl, that  she caught up a skimmer and struck her on the  back with it, and broke it in two.</paragraph>

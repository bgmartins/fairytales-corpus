	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='24'>Boys delight in men who have had adventures, and when they are privileged to read of such exploits in thrilling story form, that is the "seventh heaven" for them. Such a "boys" man" was Jack London, whose whole life was one of stirring action on land and sea. Gifted as a story teller, he wrote books almost without end. Some of them, "The Call of the Wild," "The Sea Wolf" and "White Fang," have already been recognized as fine books for boys. Others, volumes of short stories, contain many of like interest, possessing the same qualities that have made the other and longer stories so acceptable as juveniles.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='25'>Effort has been made by the editor to bring together in one volume a number of such stories, not for the reason alone that there might be another Jack London book for boys, but also in order to add to our juvenile literature a volume likely "to be chewed and digested," as Bacon says, a book worthy "to be read whole, and with diligence and attention." For my belief is that boys read altogether too few of such books. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say, have too few opportunities to read such books, because so often we fail to see how quick in their reading their minds are to grasp the more difficult, and how keen and competent their conscience to draw the right conclusion when situations are presented wherein men err so grievously.</paragraph>

Mine is no squalor of song that cannot transmute itself, with proper exchange value, into a flower-crowned cottage, a sweet mountain-meadow, a grove of redwoods, an orchard of thirty-seven trees, one long row of blackberries and two short rows of strawberries, to say nothing of a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='43'>"Oh, that all your song-transmutations were as successful!" she laughed.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='48'>"But she _was_ beautiful, now, wasn"t she?" he insisted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='49'>"And here"s where beauty and utility fall out," was her reply. "And there"s the Wolf!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='50'>From the thicket-covered hillside came a crashing of underbrush, and then, forty feet above them, on the edge of the sheer wall of rock, appeared a wolf"s head and shoulders. His braced forepaws dislodged a pebble, and with sharp-pricked ears and peering eyes he watched the fall of the pebble till it struck at their feet. Then he transferred his gaze and with open mouth laughed down at them.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='51'>"You Wolf, you!" and "You blessed Wolf!" the man and woman called out to him. The ears flattened back and down at the sound, and the head seemed to snuggle under the caress of an invisible hand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='52'>They watched him scramble backward into the thicket, then proceeded on their way. Several minutes later, rounding a turn in the trail where the descent was less precipitous, he joined them in the midst of a miniature avalanche of pebbles and loose soil. He was not demonstrative. A pat and a rub around the ears from <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fashion;pat;rub;caressing;front;ear;ground' adjectives='wolf;true;prolonged' verbs='be;glide' valence='5.832' arousal='4.28066666667' dominance='5.64866666667'>the man</entity>, and a more prolonged caressing from <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fashion;pat;rub;caressing;front;ear;ground' adjectives='wolf;true;prolonged' verbs='be;glide' valence='5.832' arousal='4.28066666667' dominance='5.64866666667'>the woman</entity>, and he was away down <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='fashion;pat;rub;caressing;front;ear;ground' adjectives='wolf;true;prolonged' verbs='be;glide' valence='5.832' arousal='4.28066666667' dominance='5.64866666667'>the trail</entity> in front of them, gliding effortlessly over the ground in true wolf fashion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='53'>In build and coat and brush he was a huge timber-wolf; but the lie was given to his wolf-hood by his color and marking. There the dog unmistakably advertised itself. No wolf was ever colored like him. He was brown, deep brown, red-brown, an orgy of browns. Back and shoulders were a warm brown that paled on the sides and underneath to a yellow that was dingy because of the brown that lingered in it. The white of the throat and paws and the spots over the eyes was dirty because of the persistent and ineradicable brown, while the eyes themselves were twin topazes, golden and brown.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='54'>The man and woman loved the dog very much; perhaps this was because it had been such a task to win his love. It had been no easy matter when he first drifted in mysteriously out of nowhere to their little mountain cottage. Footsore and famished, he had killed a rabbit under their very noses and under their very windows, and then crawled away and slept by the spring at the foot of the blackberry bushes. When <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pain;peace-offering;intruder;milk;pan;bread' adjectives='large' verbs='go;be;snarl;inspect' valence='5.040625' arousal='4.60375' dominance='5.153125'>Walt Irvine</entity> went down to inspect the intruder, he was snarled at for his pains, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pain;peace-offering;intruder;milk;pan;bread' adjectives='large' verbs='go;be;snarl;inspect' valence='5.040625' arousal='4.60375' dominance='5.153125'>Madge</entity> likewise was snarled at when she went down to present, as a peace-offering, a large pan of bread and milk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='55'>A most unsociable dog he proved to be, resenting all their advances, refusing to let them lay hands on him, menacing them with bared fangs and bristling hair. Nevertheless he remained, sleeping and resting by the spring, and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at a safe distance and retreated. His wretched physical condition explained why he lingered; and when he had recuperated, after several days" sojourn, he disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='56'>And this would have been the end of him, so far as Irvine and his wife were concerned, had not Irvine at that particular time been called away into the northern part of the state. Biding along on the train, near to the line between <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wagon;guest;train;mile;line;travel;road' adjectives='brown;wolfish;unsociable;tired;dust-covered;tireless' verbs='look;see;soil;chance;slide;bide' valence='5.6' arousal='3.73368421053' dominance='5.52421052632'>California</entity> and <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wagon;guest;train;mile;line;travel;road' adjectives='brown;wolfish;unsociable;tired;dust-covered;tireless' verbs='look;see;soil;chance;slide;bide' valence='5.6' arousal='3.73368421053' dominance='5.52421052632'>Oregon</entity>, he chanced to look out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wagon;guest;train;mile;line;travel;road' adjectives='brown;wolfish;unsociable;tired;dust-covered;tireless' verbs='look;see;soil;chance;slide;bide' valence='5.6' arousal='3.73368421053' dominance='5.52421052632'>the window</entity> and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road, brown and wolfish, tired yet tireless, dust-covered and soiled with two hundred miles of travel.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='57'>Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet. He got off the train at the next station, bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop, and captured the vagrant on the outskirts of the town. The return trip was made in the baggage car, and so Wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage. Here he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman. But it was very circumspect love-making. Remote and alien as a traveller from another planet, he snarled down their soft-spoken love-words. He never barked. In all the time they had him he was never known to bark.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='58'>To win him became a problem. Irvine liked problems. He had a metal plate made, on which was stamped: "Return to Walt Irvine, Glen Ellen, Sonoma County, California." This was riveted to a collar and strapped about the dog"s neck. Then he was turned loose, and promptly He disappeared. A day later came a telegram from Mendocino County. In twenty hours he had made over a hundred miles to the north, and was still going when captured.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='59'>He came back by Wells Fargo Express, was tied up three days, and was loosed on the fourth and lost. This time he gained southern Oregon before he was caught and returned. Always, as soon as he received his liberty, he fled away, and always he fled north. He was possessed of an obsession that drove him north. The homing instinct, <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='instinct;sonnet;price;selling;animal' adjectives='northern;homing' verbs='expend;call;have;get' valence='5.64727272727' arousal='3.68545454545' dominance='5.42454545455'>Irvine</entity> called it, after he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the animal back from northern <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='instinct;sonnet;price;selling;animal' adjectives='northern;homing' verbs='expend;call;have;get' valence='5.64727272727' arousal='3.68545454545' dominance='5.42454545455'>Oregon</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>Another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length of California, all of Oregon, and most of Washington, before he was picked up and returned "Collect." A remarkable thing was the speed with which he traveled. Fed up and rested, as soon as he was loosed he devoted all his energy to getting over the ground. On the first day"s run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles, and after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught. He always arrived back lean and hungry and savage, and always departed fresh and vigorous, cleaving his way northward in response to some prompting of his being that no one could understand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='61'>But at last, after a futile year of flight, he accepted the inevitable and elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the rabbit and slept by the spring. Even after that, a long time elapsed before the man and woman succeeded in patting him. It was a great victory, for they alone were allowed to put hands on him. He was fastidiously exclusive, and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in making up to him. A low growl greeted such approach; if any one had the hardihood to come nearer, the lips lifted, the naked fangs appeared, and the growl became a snarl--a snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed the stoutest of them, as it likewise awed the farmers" dogs that knew ordinary dog snarling, but had never seen wolf snarling before.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='62'>He was without antecedents. His history began with Walt and Madge. He had come up from the south, but never a clew did they get of the owner from whom he had evidently fled. Mrs. Johnson, their nearest neighbor and the one who supplied them with milk, proclaimed him a Klondike dog. Her brother was burrowing for frozen pay-streaks in that far country, and so she constituted herself an authority on the subject.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='63'>But they did not dispute her. There were the tips of Wolf"s ears, obviously so severely frozen at some time that they would never quite heal again. Besides, he looked like the photographs of the Alaskan dogs they saw published in magazines and newspapers. They often speculated over his past, and tried to conjure up (from what they had read and heard) what his northland life had been. That the northland still drew him, they knew; for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly; and when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air, a great restlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament which they knew to be the long wolf-howl. Yet he never barked. No provocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>Long discussion they had, during the time of winning him, as to whose dog he was. Each claimed him, and each proclaimed loudly any expression of affection made by him. But the man had the better of it at first, chiefly because he was a man. It was patent that Wolf had had no experience with women. He did not understand women. Madge"s skirts were something he never quite accepted. The swish of them was enough to set him a-bristle with suspicion, and on a windy day she could not approach him at all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='4' num='65'>On the other hand, it was Madge who fed him; also it was she who ruled the kitchen, and it was by her favor, and her favor alone, that he was permitted to come within that sacred precinct. It was because of these things that she bade fair to overcome the handicap of her garments. Then it was that Walt put forth special effort, making it a practice to have Wolf lie at his feet while he wrote, and, between petting and talking, losing much time from his work. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;redwood;taste;energy;brook;mile;victory;wind;judgment;song-transmutation;fact;man' adjectives='west;natural;due;least;unbiased' verbs='be;devote;win;leave;exercise;have;sigh;aver;gurgle' valence='5.74727272727' arousal='4.16909090909' dominance='5.53181818182'>Walt</entity> won in the end, and his victory was most probably due to the fact that he was a man, though <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;redwood;taste;energy;brook;mile;victory;wind;judgment;song-transmutation;fact;man' adjectives='west;natural;due;least;unbiased' verbs='be;devote;win;leave;exercise;have;sigh;aver;gurgle' valence='5.74727272727' arousal='4.16909090909' dominance='5.53181818182'>Madge</entity> averred that they would have had another quarter of a mile of gurgling brook, and at least two west winds sighing through their redwoods, had <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;redwood;taste;energy;brook;mile;victory;wind;judgment;song-transmutation;fact;man' adjectives='west;natural;due;least;unbiased' verbs='be;devote;win;leave;exercise;have;sigh;aver;gurgle' valence='5.74727272727' arousal='4.16909090909' dominance='5.53181818182'>Walt</entity> properly devoted his energies to song-transmutation and left <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='end;redwood;taste;energy;brook;mile;victory;wind;judgment;song-transmutation;fact;man' adjectives='west;natural;due;least;unbiased' verbs='be;devote;win;leave;exercise;have;sigh;aver;gurgle' valence='5.74727272727' arousal='4.16909090909' dominance='5.53181818182'>Wolf</entity> alone to exercise a natural taste and an unbiased judgment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='66'>"It"s about time I heard from those triolets," Walt said, after a silence of five minutes, during which they had swung steadily down the trail. "There"ll be a check at the post office, I know, and we"ll transmute it into beautiful buckwheat flour, a gallon of maple syrup, and a new pair of overshoes for you."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>Up from below came another sound that broke in upon Walt reading softly from his manuscript. It was a crunching of heavy feet, punctuated now and again by the clattering of a displaced stone. As Walt finished and looked to his wife for approval, a man came into view around the turn of the trail. He was bareheaded and sweaty. With a handkerchief in one hand he mopped his face, while in the other hand he carried a new hat and a wilted starched collar which he had removed from his neck. He was a well-built man, and his muscles seemed on the point of bursting out of the painfully new and ready-made black clothes he wore.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='177'>Wolf"s perturbation began to wax. He desired ubiquity. He wanted to be in two places at the same time, with the old master and the new, and steadily the distance between them was increasing. He sprang about excitedly, making short nervous leaps and twists, now toward one, now toward the other, in painful indecision, not knowing his own mind, desiring both and unable to choose, uttering quick sharp whines and beginning to pant.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='178'>He sat down abruptly on his haunches, thrusting his nose upward, the mouth opening and closing with jerking movements, each time opening wider. These jerking movements were in unison with the recurrent spasms that attacked the throat, each spasm severer and more intense than the preceding one. And in accord with jerks and spasms the larynx began to vibrate, at first silently, accompanied by the rush of air expelled from the lungs, then sounding a low, deep note, the lowest in the register of the human ear. All this was the nervous and muscular preliminary to howling.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='179'>But just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the full throat, the wide-opened mouth was closed, the paroxysms ceased, and he looked long and steadily at the retreating man. Suddenly Wolf turned his head, and over his shoulder just as steadily regarded Walt. The appeal was unanswered. Not a word nor a sign did the dog receive, no suggestion and no clew as to what his conduct should be.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='180'>A glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve of the trail excited him again. He sprang to his feet with a whine, and then, struck by a new idea, turned his attention to Madge. Hitherto he had ignored her, but now, both masters failing him, she alone was left. He went over to her and snuggled his head in her lap, nudging her arm with his nose--an old trick of his when begging for favors. He backed away from her and began writhing and twisting playfully, curvetting and prancing, half rearing and striking his forepaws to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='body;eye;forepaw;wheedling;thought;rearing;tail;curvetting;ear;utterance' adjectives='wagging;striking' verbs='be;begin;express;deny;writhe;back;twist;struggle;flatten;prance' valence='5.56375' arousal='4.076875' dominance='5.603125'>the earth</entity>, struggling with all his body, from the wheedling eyes and flattening ears to the wagging tail, to express the thought that was in him and that was denied him utterance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='181'>This, too, he soon abandoned. He was depressed by the coldness of these humans who had never been cold before. No response could he draw from them, no help could he get. They did not consider him. They were as dead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='182'>He turned and silently gazed after the old master. Skiff Miller was rounding the curve. In a moment he would be gone from view. Yet he never turned his head, plodding straight onward, slowly and methodically, as though possessed of no interest in what was occurring behind his back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='183'>And in this fashion he went out of view. Wolf waited for him to reappear. He waited a long minute, silently, quietly, without movement, as though turned to stone--withal stone quick with eagerness and desire. He barked once, and waited. Then he turned and trotted back to Walt Irvine. He sniffed his hand and dropped down heavily at his feet, watching <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='foot;view;hand' adjectives='' verbs='curve;drop;watch;sniff' valence='5.4275' arousal='3.86875' dominance='5.8875'>the trail</entity> where it curved emptily from view.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='184'>The tiny stream slipping down the mossy-lipped stone seemed suddenly to increase the volume of its gurgling noise.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='185'>A few minutes later Wolf got upon his feet. Decision and deliberation marked his movements. He did not glance at the man and woman.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='186'>He broke into a trot, and Madge"s lips pursed, forming an avenue for the caressing sound that it was the will of her to send forth.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='190'>THAT SPOT</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='191'>I don"t think much of Stephen Mackaye any more, though I used to swear by him. I know that in those days I loved him more than my own brother. If ever I meet Stephen Mackaye again, I shall not be responsible for my actions. It passes beyond me that a man with whom I shared food and blanket, and with whom I mushed over the Chilcoot Trail, should turn out the way he did. I always sized Steve up as a square man, a kindly comrade, without an iota of anything vindictive or malicious in his nature. I shall never trust my judgment in men again. Why, I nursed that man through typhoid fever; we starved together on the headwaters of the Stewart; and he saved my life on the Little Salmon. And now, after the years we were together, all I can say of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='man' adjectives='meanest' verbs='be;say;know' valence='5.885' arousal='3.879' dominance='5.685'>Stephen Mackaye</entity> is that he is the meanest man I ever knew.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='192'>We started for the Klondike in the fall rush of 1897, and we started too late to get over Chilcoot Pass before the freeze-up. We packed our outfit on our backs part way over, when the snow began to fly, and then we had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way. That was how we came to get that Spot. Dogs were high, and we paid one hundred and ten dollars for him. He looked worth it. I say _looked_, because he was one of the finest appearing dogs I ever saw. He weighed sixty pounds, and he had all the lines of a good sled animal. We never could make out his breed. He wasn"t husky, nor Malemute, nor Hudson Bay; he looked like all of them and he didn"t look like any of them; and on top of it all he had some of the white man"s dog in him, for on one side, in the thick of the mixed yellow-brown-red-and-dirty-white that was his prevailing color, there was a spot of coal-black as big as a water-bucket. That was why we called him Spot.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='193'>He was a good looker all right. When he was in condition his muscles stood out in bunches all over him. And he was the strongest looking brute I ever saw in Alaska, also the most intelligent looking. To run your eyes over him, you"d think he could outpull three dogs of his own weight. Maybe he could, but I never saw it. His intelligence didn"t run that way. He could steal and forage to perfection; he had an instinct that was positively grewsome for divining when work was to be done and for making a sneak accordingly; and for getting lost and not staying lost he was nothing short of inspired. But when it came to work, <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='clot;intelligence;jelly;heart' adjectives='stupid;mere' verbs='wobble;make;work;bleed;leave;come;dribble' valence='5.08125' arousal='4.203125' dominance='5.245'>the way</entity> that intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of wobbling, stupid jelly would make your heart bleed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='194'>There are times when I think it wasn"t stupidity. Maybe, like some men I know, he was too wise to work. I shouldn"t wonder if he put it all over us with that intelligence of his. Maybe he figured it all out and decided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot better than work all the time and no licking. He was intelligent enough for such a computation. I tell you, I"ve sat and looked into that dog"s eyes till the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like yeast, what of the intelligence I saw shining out. I can"t express myself about that intelligence. It is beyond mere words. I saw it, that"s all. At times it was like gazing into a human soul, to look into his eyes; and what I saw there frightened me and started all sorts of ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest. I tell you I sensed something big in that brute"s eyes; there was a message there, but I wasn"t big enough myself to catch it. Whatever it was (I know I"m making a fool of myself)--whatever it was, it baffled me. I can"t give an inkling of what I saw in that brute"s eyes; it wasn"t light, it wasn"t color; it was something that moved, away back, when the eyes themselves weren"t moving. And I guess I didn"t see it move, either; I only sensed that it moved. It was an expression,--that"s what it was,--and I got an impression of it. No; it was different from a mere expression; it was more than that. I don"t know what it was, but it gave me a feeling of kinship just the same. Oh, no, not sentimental kinship. It was, rather, a kinship of equality. Those eyes never pleaded like a deer"s eyes. They challenged. No, it wasn"t defiance. It was just a calm assumption of equality. And I don"t think it was deliberate. My belief is that it was unconscious on his part. It was there because it was there, and it couldn"t help shining out. No, I don"t mean shine. It didn"t shine; it _moved_. I know I"m talking rot, but if you"d looked into that animal"s eyes the way I have, you"d understand. Steve was affected the same way I was. Why, I tried to kill that Spot once--he was no good for anything; and I fell down on it. I led him out into the brush, and he came along slow and unwilling. He knew what was going on. I stopped in a likely place, put my foot on the rope, and pulled my big Colt"s. And that dog sat down and looked at me. I tell you he didn"t plead. He just looked. And I saw all kinds of incomprehensible things moving, yes, _moving,_ in those eyes of his. I didn"t really see them move; I thought I saw them, for, as I said before, I guess I only sensed them. And I want to tell you right now that it got beyond me. It was like killing a man, a conscious, brave man who looked calmly into your gun as much as to say, "Who"s afraid?" Then, too, the message seemed so near that, instead of pulling the trigger quick, I stopped to see if I could catch the message. There it was, right before me, glimmering all around in those eyes of his. And then it was too late. I got scared. I was trembly all over, and my stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me seasick. I just sat down and looked at that dog, and he looked at me, till I thought I was going crazy. Do you want to know what I did? I threw down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of God in my heart. Steve laughed at me. But I notice that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='spot;purpose' adjectives='little;later;same' verbs='drift;notice;come;lead' valence='5.281875' arousal='3.77375' dominance='5.293125'>Steve</entity> led Spot into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='spot;purpose' adjectives='little;later;same' verbs='drift;notice;come;lead' valence='5.281875' arousal='3.77375' dominance='5.293125'>the woods</entity>, a week later, for the same purpose, and that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='spot;purpose' adjectives='little;later;same' verbs='drift;notice;come;lead' valence='5.281875' arousal='3.77375' dominance='5.293125'>Steve</entity> came back alone, and a little later Spot drifted back, too.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='195'>At any rate, Spot wouldn"t work. We paid a hundred and ten dollars for him from the bottom of our sack, and he wouldn"t work. He wouldn"t even tighten the traces. Steve spoke to him the first time we put him in harness, and he sort of shivered, that was all. Not an ounce on the traces. He just stood still and wobbled, like so much jelly. Steve touched him with the whip. He yelped, but not an ounce. Steve touched him again, a bit harder, and he howled--the regular long wolf howl. Then Steve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and I came on the run from the tent. I told Steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some words--the first we"d ever had. He threw the whip down in the snow, and walked away mad. I picked it up and went to it. That Spot trembled and wobbled and cowered before ever I swung the lash, and with the first bite of it he howled like a lost soul. Next he lay down in the snow. I started the rest of the dogs, and they dragged him along while I threw the whip into him. He rolled over on his back and bumped along, his four legs waving in the air, himself howling as though he was going through a sausage machine. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='d' adjectives='' verbs='say;come;laugh;apologize' valence='5.42333333333' arousal='4.52555555556' dominance='5.51666666667'>Steve</entity> came back and laughed at me, and I apologized for what I"d said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='196'>There was no getting any work out of that Spot; and to make up for it, he was the biggest pig-glutton of a dog I ever saw. On top of that, he was the cleverest thief. There was no circumventing him. Many a breakfast we went without our bacon because Spot had been there first. And it was because of him that we nearly starved to death up the Stewart. He figured out the way to break into our meat-cache, and what he didn"t eat, the rest of the team did. But he was impartial. He stole from every body. He was a restless dog always very busy snooping around or going somewhere. And there was never a camp within five miles that he didn"t raid. The worst of it was that they always came back on us to pay his board bill, which was just, being the law of the land; but it was mighty hard on us, especially that first winter on the Chilcoot, when we were busted, paying for whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate. He could fight, too, that Spot. He could do anything but work. He never pulled a pound, but he was the boss of the whole team. The way he made those dogs stand around was an education. He bullied them, and there was always one or more of them fresh-marked with his fangs. But he was more than a bully. He wasn"t afraid of anything that walked on four legs; and I"ve seen him march, single-handed, into a strange team, without any provocation whatever, and put the _kibosh_ on the whole outfit. Did I say he could eat? I caught him eating the whip once. That"s straight. He started in at the lash, and when I caught him he was down to the handle, and still going.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='197'>But he was a good looker. At the end of the first week we sold him for seventy-five dollars to the Mounted Police. They had experienced dog-drivers, and we knew that by the time he"d covered the six hundred miles to Dawson he"d be a good sled-dog. I say we _knew_, for we were just getting acquainted with that Spot. A little later we were not brash enough to know anything where he was concerned. A week later we woke up in the morning to the dangdest dog-fight we"d ever heard. It was that Spot came back and knocking the team into shape. We ate a pretty depressing breakfast, I can tell you; but cheered up two hours afterward when we sold him to an official courier, bound in to Dawson with government despatches. That Spot was only three days in coming back, and, as usual, celebrated his arrival with a rough-house.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='198'>We spent the winter and spring, after our own outfit was across the pass, freighting other people"s outfits; and we made a fat stake. Also, we made money out of Spot. If we sold him once, we sold him twenty times. He always came back, and no one asked for their money. We didn"t want the money. We"d have paid handsomely for any one to take him off our hands for keeps. We had to get rid of him, and we couldn"t give him away, for that would have been suspicious. But he was such a fine looker that we never had any difficulty in selling him. "Unbroke," we"d say, and they"d pay any old price for him. We sold him as low as twenty-five dollars, and once we got a hundred and fifty for him. That particular party returned him in person, refused to take his money back, and the way he abused us was something awful. He said it was cheap at the price to tell us what he thought of us; and we felt he was so justified that we never talked back. But to this day I"ve never quite regained all the old self-respect that was mine before that man talked to me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='199'>When the ice cleared out of the lakes and river, we put our outfit in a Lake Bennett boat and started for Dawson. We had a good team of dogs, and of course we piled them on top the outfit. That Spot was along--there was no losing him; and a dozen times, the first day, he knocked one or another of the dogs overboard in the course of fighting with them. It was close quarters, and he didn"t like being crowded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='200'>"What that dog needs is space," Steve said the second day. "Let"s maroon him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='201'>We did, running the boat in at Caribou Crossing for him to jump ashore. Two of the other dogs, good dogs, followed him; and we lost two whole days trying to find them. We never saw those two dogs again; but the quietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide, like the man who refused his hundred and fifty, that it was cheap at the price. For the first time in months Steve and I laughed and whistled and sang. We were as happy as clams. The dark days were over. The nightmare had been lifted. That Spot was gone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='202'>Three weeks later, one morning, Steve and I were standing on the river-bank at Dawson. A small boat was just arriving from Lake Bennett. I saw Steve give a start, and heard him say something that was not nice and that was not under his breath. Then I looked; and there, in the bow of the boat, with ears pricked up, sat Spot. Steve and I sneaked immediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like absconders from justice. It was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he saw us sneaking. He surmised that there was law-officers in the boat who were after us. He didn"t wait to find out, but kept us in sight, and in the M. &amp; M. saloon got us in a corner. We had a merry time explaining, for we refused to go back to the boat and meet Spot; and finally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the boat. After we got clear of him, we started for the cabin, and when we arrived, there was that Spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us. Now how did he know we lived there? There were forty thousand people in Dawson that summer, and how did he _savve_ our cabin out of all the cabins? How did he know we were in Dawson, anyway? I leave it to you. But don"t forget what I have said about his intelligence and that immortal something I have seen glimmering in his eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='203'>There was no getting rid of him any more. There were too many people in Dawson who had bought him up on Chilcoot, and the story got around. Half a dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down the Yukon; but he merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted back up the bank. We couldn"t sell him, we couldn"t kill him (both Steve and I had tried), and nobody else was able to kill him. He bore a charmed life. I"ve seen him go down in a dog-fight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of him, and when they were separated, he"d appear on all his four legs, unharmed, while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would be lying dead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='204'>I saw him steal a chunk of moose meat from Major Dinwiddie"s cache so heavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of Mrs. Dinwiddie"s squaw cook, who was after him with an axe. As he went up the hill, after the squaw gave up, Major Dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his Winchester into the landscape. He emptied his magazine twice, and never touched that Spot. Then a policeman came along and arrested him for discharging firearms inside the city limits. Major Dinwiddie paid his fine, and Steve and I paid him for the moose meat at the rate of a dollar a pound, bones and all. That was what he paid for it. Meat was high that year.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='205'>I am only telling what I saw with my own eyes. And now I"ll tell you something also. I saw that Spot fall through a water-hole. The ice was three and a half feet thick, and the current sucked him under like a straw. Three hundred yards below was the big water-hole used by the hospital. Spot crawled out of the hospital water-hole, licked off the water, bit out the ice that had formed between his toes, trotted up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='commissioner;gold;hospital;spot;ice;water;water-hole;bit;toe' adjectives='big' verbs='lick;form;belong;have;crawl;whip;trot' valence='5.45277777778' arousal='4.18888888889' dominance='5.32611111111'>the bank</entity>, and whipped a big <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='commissioner;gold;hospital;spot;ice;water;water-hole;bit;toe' adjectives='big' verbs='lick;form;belong;have;crawl;whip;trot' valence='5.45277777778' arousal='4.18888888889' dominance='5.32611111111'>Newfoundland</entity> belonging to the Gold Commissioner.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='206'>In the fall of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the last water, bound for Stewart River. We took the dogs along, all except Spot. We figured we"d been feeding him long enough. He"d cost us more time and trouble and money and grub than we"d got by selling him on the Chilcoot--especially grub. So Steve and I tied him down in the cabin and pulled our freight. We camped that night at the mouth of Indian River, and Steve and I were pretty facetious over having shaken him. Steve was a funny fellow, and I was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing when a tornado hit camp. The way that Spot walked into those dogs and gave them what-for was hair-raising. Now how did he get loose? It"s up to you. I haven"t any theory. And how did he get across the Klondike River? That"s another facer. And anyway, how did he know we had gone up the Yukon? You see, we went by water, and he couldn"t smell our tracks. Steve and I began to get superstitious about that dog. He got on our nerves, too; and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='207'>The freeze-up came on when we were at the mouth of Henderson Creek, and we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up White River after copper. Now that whole outfit was lost. Never trace nor hide nor hair of men, dogs, sleds, or anything was ever found. They dropped clean out of sight. It became one of the mysteries of the country. Steve and I plugged away up the Stewart, and six weeks afterward that Spot crawled into camp. He was a perambulating skeleton, and could just drag along; but he got there. And what I want to know is who told him we were up the Stewart? We could have gone a thousand other places. How did he know? You tell me, and I"ll tell you.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='208'>No losing him. At the Mayo he started a row with an Indian dog. The buck who owned the dog took a swing at Spot with an axe, missed him, and killed his own dog. Talk about magic and turning bullets aside--I, for one, consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big buck at the other end of it. And I saw him do it with my own eyes.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='209'>I told you about Spot breaking into our meat-cache. It was nearly the death of us. There wasn"t any more meat to be killed and meat was all we had to live on. The moose had gone back several hundred miles and the Indians with them. There we were. Spring was on and we had to wait for the river to break. We got pretty thin before we decided to eat the dogs, and we decided to eat Spot first. Do you know what that dog did? He sneaked. Now how did he know our minds were made up to eat him? We sat up nights laying for him, but he never came back, and we ate the other dogs. We ate the whole team.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='210'>And now for the sequel. You know what it is when a big river breaks up and a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and milling and grinding. Just in the thick of it, when the Stewart went out, rumbling and roaring, we sighted Spot out in the middle. He"d got caught as he was trying to cross up above somewhere. Steve and I yelled and shouted and ran up and down the bank, tossing our hats in the air. Sometimes we"d stop and hug each other, we were that boisterous, for we saw Spot"s finish. He didn"t have a chance in a million. He didn"t have any chance at all. After the ice-run, we got into a canoe and paddled down to the Yukon, and down the Yukon to Dawson, stopping to feed up for a week at the cabins at the mouth of Henderson Creek. And as we came in to the bank at Dawson, there sat that Spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked up, his tail wagging, his mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to us. Now how did he get out of that ice?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='211'>Steve wrote to me once, and his letter seemed irritated. He took it kind of hard because I"d left him with Spot. Also, he said he"d used the "rough-on-rats," per directions, and that there was nothing doing. A year went by. I was back in the office and prospering in all ways--even getting a bit fat. And then Steve arrived. He didn"t look me up. I read his name in the steamer list, and wondered why. But I didn"t wonder long. I got up one morning and found that Spot chained to the gatepost and holding up the milkman. Steve went north to Seattle, I learned, that very morning. I didn"t put on any more weight. My wife made me buy him a collar and tag, and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing her pet Persian cat. There is no getting rid of that Spot. He will be with me until I die, for he"ll never die. My appetite is not so good since he arrived, and my wife says I am looking peaked. Last night that Spot got into Mr. Harvey"s hen-house (Harvey is my next door neighbor) and killed nineteen of his fancy-bred chickens. I shall have to pay for them. My neighbors on the other side quarreled with my wife and then moved out. Spot was the cause of it. And that is why I am disappointed in Stephen Mackaye. I had no idea he was so mean a man.</paragraph>

Her decks were piled high with freight and baggage, and swarmed with a heterogeneous company of Indians, dogs, and dog-mushers, prospectors, traders, and homeward-bound gold-seekers. A goodly portion of Dawson was lined up on the bank, saying good-by. As the gang-plank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream, the clamor of farewell became deafening. Also, in that eleventh moment, everybody began to remember final farewell messages and to shout them back and forth across the widening stretch of water. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='rail;hand;shore;something;mustache;friend' adjectives='other;yellow' verbs='spring;curl;remember;wave' valence='6.06727272727' arousal='3.82818181818' dominance='5.87636363636'>Louis Bondell</entity>, curling his yellow mustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to his friends on shore, suddenly remembered something and sprang to the rail.</paragraph>

Among them was Churchill. In his stateroom, in the middle of a clothes-bag, was Louis Bondell"s grip. It was a small, stout leather affair, and its weight of forty pounds always made Churchill nervous when he wandered too far from it. The man in the adjoining stateroom had a treasure of gold-dust hidden similarly in a clothes-bag, and the pair of them ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch. While one went down to eat, the other kept an eye on the two stateroom doors.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='227'>When the _W.H. Willis_ pulled into White Horse, it was learned that the _Flora_ had waited three days over the limit, and had departed only a few hours before. Also, it was learned that she would tie up at Tagish Post till nine o"clock, Sunday morning. It was then four o"clock Saturday afternoon. The pilgrims called a meeting. On board was a large Peterborough canoe, consigned to the police post at the head of Lake Bennett. They agreed to be responsible for it and to deliver it. Next, they called for volunteers. Two men were needed to make a race for the _Flora_. A score of men volunteered on the instant. Among them was Churchill, such being his nature that he volunteered before he thought of Bondell"s gripsack. When this thought came to him, he began to hope that he would not be selected; but a man who had made a name as captain of a college football eleven, as a president of an athletic club, as a dog-musher and a stampeder in the Yukon, and, moreover, who possessed such shoulders as he, had no right to avoid the honor. It was thrust upon him and upon a gigantic German, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='gigantic' verbs='thrust;be' valence='5.57' arousal='4.9025' dominance='5.5375'>Nick Antonsen</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='228'>It was half-past four in the afternoon when the two men started. The current of the Thirty Mile River was so strong that rarely could they use the paddles. It was out on one bank with a tow-line over the shoulders stumbling over the rocks, forcing a way through the underbrush, slipping at times and falling into the water, wading often up to the knees and waist; and then, when an insurmountable bluff was encountered, it was into the canoe, out paddles, and a wild and losing dash across the current to the other bank, in paddles, over the side, and out tow-line again. It was exhausting work. Antonsen toiled like the giant he was, uncomplaining, persistent, but driven to his utmost by the powerful body and indomitable brain of Churchill. They never paused for rest. It was go, go, and keep on going. A crisp wind blew down the river, freezing their hands and making it imperative, from time to time, to beat the blood back into the numb fingers. As night came on, they were compelled to trust to luck. They fell repeatedly on the untraveled banks and tore their clothing to shreds in the underbrush they could not see. Both men were badly scratched and bleeding. A dozen times, in their wild dashes from bank to bank, they struck snags and were capsized. The first time this happened, Churchill dived and groped in three feet of water for the gripsack. He lost half an hour in recovering it, and after that it was carried securely lashed to the canoe. As long as the canoe floated it was safe. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grip;explanation' adjectives='' verbs='vouchsafe;jeer;abuse;begin' valence='5.18' arousal='4.14' dominance='5.34'>Antonsen</entity> jeered at the grip, and toward morning began to abuse it; but <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grip;explanation' adjectives='' verbs='vouchsafe;jeer;abuse;begin' valence='5.18' arousal='4.14' dominance='5.34'>Churchill</entity> vouchsafed no explanations.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='229'>Their delays and mischances were endless. On one swift bend, around which poured a healthy young rapid, they lost two hours, making a score of attempts and capsizing twice. At this point, on both banks, were precipitous bluffs, rising out of deep water, and along which they could neither tow nor pole, while they could not gain with the paddles against the current. At each attempt they strained to the utmost with the paddles, and each time, with hearts nigh to bursting from the effort, they were played out and swept back. They succeeded finally by an accident. In the swiftest current, near the end of another failure, a freak of the current sheered the canoe out of Churchill"s control and flung it against the bluff. Churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and landed in a crevice. Holding on with one hand, he held the swamped canoe with the other till Antonsen dragged himself out of the water. Then they pulled the canoe out and rested. A fresh start at this crucial point took them by. They landed on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='brush;tow-line' adjectives='' verbs='plunge;land' valence='5.675' arousal='3.755' dominance='5.1975'>the bank</entity> above and plunged immediately ashore and into the brush with the tow-line.</paragraph>

And when, at ten o"clock, they dragged themselves in to the Post, they could just barely see the _Flora"s_ smoke far to the southward. It was a pair of worn-out tatterdemalions that Captain Jones of the Mounted Police welcomed and fed, and he afterward averred that they possessed two of the most tremendous appetites he had ever observed. They lay down and slept in their wet rags by the stove.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='232'>Tagish Lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their teeth. Big, swinging seas rushed upon the canoe, compelling one man to bail and leaving one man to paddle. Headway could not be made. They ran along the shallow shore and went overboard, one man ahead on the tow-line, the other shoving on the canoe. They fought the gale up to their waists in the icy water, often up to their necks, often over their heads and buried by the big, crested waves. There was no rest, never a moment"s pause from the cheerless, heart-breaking battle. That night, at the head of Tagish Lake, in the thick of a driving snow-squall, they overhauled the _Flora._ Antonsen fell on board, lay where he had fallen, and snored. Churchill looked like a wild man. His clothes barely clung to him. His face was iced up and swollen from the protracted effort of twenty-four hours, while his hands were so swollen that he could not close the fingers. As for his feet, it was an agony to stand upon them.</paragraph>

Every few minutes the pain of the pent circulation aroused him, whereupon he would look at his watch and twist the other arm under his head. At the end of two hours he fought with Antonsen to rouse him. Then they started. Lake Bennett, thirty miles in length, was like a mill-pond; but, halfway across, a gale from the south smote them and turned the water white. Hour after hour they repeated the struggle on Tagish, over the side, pulling and shoving on the canoe, up to their waists and necks, and over their heads, in the icy water; toward the last the good-natured giant played completely out. Churchill drove him mercilessly; but when he pitched forward and bade fair to drown in three feet of water, the other dragged him into the canoe. After that, Churchill fought on alone, arriving at the police post at the head of Bennett in the early afternoon. He tried to help Antonsen out of the canoe, but failed. He listened to the exhausted man"s heavy breathing, and envied him when he thought of what he himself had yet to undergo. Antonsen could lie there and sleep; but he, behind time, must go on over mighty Chilcoot and down to the sea. The real struggle lay before him, and he almost regretted the strength that resided in his frame because of the torment it could inflict upon that frame.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='242'>A mile portage connected Lake Bennett and Lake Linderman, and his last words he flung back after him as he resumed the trot. It was a very painful trot, but he clenched his teeth and kept on, forgetting his pain most of the time in the fervent heat with which he regarded the gripsack. It was a severe handicap. He swung it from one hand to the other, and back again. He tucked it under his arm. He threw one hand over the opposite shoulder, and the bag bumped and pounded on his back as he ran along. He could scarcely hold it in his bruised and swollen fingers, and several times he dropped it. Once, in changing from one hand to the other, it escaped his clutch and fell in front of him, tripped him up, and threw him violently to the ground.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='243'>At the far end of the portage he bought an old set of pack-straps for a dollar, and in them he swung the grip. Also, he chartered a launch to run him the six miles to the upper end of Lake Linderman, where he arrived at four in the afternoon. The _Athenian_ was to sail from Dyea next morning at seven. Dyea was twenty-eight miles away, and between towered Chilcoot. He sat down to adjust his foot-gear for the long climb, and woke up. He had dozed the instant he sat down, though he had not slept thirty seconds. He was afraid his next doze might be longer, so he finished fixing his foot-gear standing up. Even then he was overpowered for a fleeting moment. He experienced the flash of unconsciousness; becoming aware of it, in midair, as his relaxed body was sinking to the ground and as he caught himself together, he stiffened his muscles with a spasmodic wrench, and escaped the fall. The sudden jerk back to consciousness left him sick and trembling. He beat his head with the heel of his hand, knocking wakefulness into the numb brain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='244'>Jack Burns"s pack-train was starting back light for Crater Lake, and Churchill was invited to a mule. Burns wanted to put the gripsack on another animal, but Churchill held on to it, carrying it on his saddle-pommel. But he dozed, and the grip persisted in dropping off the pommel, one side or the other, each time wakening him with a sickening start. Then, in the early darkness, Churchill"s mule brushed him against a projecting branch that laid his cheek open. To cap it, the mule blundered off the trail and fell, throwing rider and gripsack out upon the rocks. After that, Churchill walked, or stumbled, rather, over the apology for a trail, leading the mule. Stray and awful odors, drifting from each side the trail, told of the horses that had died in the rush for gold. But he did not mind. He was too sleepy. By the time Long Lake was reached, however, he had recovered from his sleepiness; and at Deep Lake he resigned the gripsack to Burns. But thereafter, by the light of the dim stars, he kept his eyes on Burns. There were not going to be any accidents with that bag.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='245'>The first rise of the divide from Crater Lake was across a small glacier. Here was a well-defined trail. But above the glacier, which was also above timber-line, was naught but a chaos of naked rock and enormous boulders. There was no way of seeing the trail in the darkness, and he blundered on, paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he accomplished. He won the summit in the thick of howling wind and driving snow, providentially stumbling upon a small, deserted tent, into which he crawled. There he found and bolted some ancient fried potatoes and half a dozen raw eggs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='246'>When the snow ceased and the wind eased down, he began the almost impossible descent. There was no trail, and he stumbled and blundered, often finding himself, at the last moment, on the edge of rocky walls and steep slopes the depth of which he had no way of judging. Part way down, the stars clouded over again, and in the consequent obscurity he slipped and rolled and slid for a hundred feet, landing bruised and bleeding on the bottom of a large shallow hole. From all about him arose the stench of dead horses. The hole was handy to the trail, and the packers had made a practice of tumbling into it their broken and dying animals. The stench overpowered him, making him deathly sick, and as in a nightmare he scrambled out. Halfway up, he recollected Bondell"s gripsack. It had fallen into the hole with him; the pack-strap had evidently broken, and he had forgotten it. Back he went into the pestilential charnel-pit, where he crawled around on hands and knees and groped for half an hour. Altogether he encountered and counted seventeen dead horses (and one horse still alive that he shot with his revolver) before he found Bondell"s grip. Looking back upon a life that had not been without valor and achievement, he unhesitatingly declared to himself that this return after the grip was the most heroic act he had ever performed. So heroic was it that he was twice on the verge of fainting before he crawled out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='verge' adjectives='heroic' verbs='be;faint;crawl' valence='5.38857142857' arousal='3.9' dominance='5.02428571429'>the hole</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='247'>By the time he had descended to the Scales, the steep pitch of Chilcoot was past, and the way became easier. Not that it was an easy way, however, in the best of places; but it became a really possible trail, along which he could have made good time if he had not been worn out, if he had had light with which to pick his steps, and if it had not been for Bondell"s gripsack. To him, in his exhausted condition, it was the last straw. Having barely strength to carry himself along, the additional weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him nearly every time he tripped or stumbled. And when he escaped tripping, branches reached out in the darkness, hooked the grip between his shoulders, and held him back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='248'>His mind was made up that if he missed the _Athenian_ it would be the fault of the gripsack. In fact, only two things remained in his consciousness--Bondell"s grip and the steamer. He knew only those two things, and they became identified, in a way, with some stern mission upon which he had journeyed and toiled for centuries. He walked and struggled on as in a dream. A part of the dream was his arrival at Sheep Camp. He stumbled into a saloon, slid his shoulders out of the straps, and started to deposit the grip at his feet.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='250'>"Hey! not that way!" the barkeeper shouted, and then went after him and started him through the darkness toward Canyon City. Some little husk of inner consciousness told Churchill that the direction was right, and, still as in a dream, he took the canyon trail. He did not know what warned him, but after what seemed several centuries of travelling, he sensed danger and drew his revolver. Still in the dream, he saw two men step out and heard them halt him. His revolver went off four times, and he saw the flashes and heard the explosions of their revolvers. Also, he was aware that he had been hit in the thigh. He saw one man go down, and, as the other came for him, he smashed him a straight blow with the heavy revolver full in the face. Then he turned and ran. He came from the dream shortly afterward, to find himself plunging down the trail at a limping lope. His first thought was for the gripsack. It was still on his back. He was convinced that what had happened was a dream till he felt for his revolver and found it gone. Next he became aware of a sharp stinging of his thigh, and after investigating, he found his hand warm with blood. It was a superficial wound, but it was incontestable.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='277'>ALL GOLD CANYON</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='278'>It was the green heart of the canyon, where the walls swerved back from the rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little sheltered nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness and softness. Here all things rested. Even the narrow stream ceased its turbulent down-rush long enough to form a quiet pool. Knee-deep in the water, with drooping head and half-shut eyes, drowsed a red-coated, many-antlered buck.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='279'>On one side, beginning at the very lip of the pool, was a tiny meadow, a cool, resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the frowning wall. Beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to meet the opposing wall. Fine grass covered the slope--grass that was spangled with flowers, with here and there patches of color, orange and purple and golden. Below, the canyon was shut in. There was no view. The walls leaned together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of rocks, moss-covered and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers and boughs of trees. Up the canyon rose far hills and peaks, the big foothills, pine-covered and remote. And far beyond, like clouds upon <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sun;sky;snow;s;blaze;minaret;cloud' adjectives='white;eternal' verbs='tower;flash' valence='6.09' arousal='4.11916666667' dominance='5.2525'>the border</entity> of the sky, towered minarets of white, where the Sierra"s eternal snows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='280'>There was no dust in the canyon. The leaves and flowers were clean and virginal. The grass was young velvet. Over the pool three cottonwoods sent their snowy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air. On the slope the blossoms of the wine-wooded manzanita filled the air with springtime odors, while the leaves, wise with experience, were already beginning their vertical twist against the coming aridity of summer. In the open spaces on the slope, beyond the farthest shadow-reach of the manzanita, poised the mariposa lilies, like so many flights of jewelled moths suddenly arrested and on the verge of trembling into flight again. Here and there that woods harlequin, the madrone, permitting itself to be caught in the act of changing its pea-green trunk to madder-red, breathed its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen bells. Creamy white were these bells, shaped like lilies-of-the-valley, with the sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='281'>There was not a sigh of wind. The air was drowsy with its weight of perfume. It was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air been heavy and humid. But the air was sharp and thin. It was as starlight transmuted into atmosphere, shot through and warmed by sunshine, and flower-drenched with sweetness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='282'>An occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light and shade. And from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain bees--feasting Sybarites that jostled one another good-naturedly at the board, nor found time for rough discourtesy. So quietly did the little stream drip and ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in faint and occasional gurgles. The voice of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='whisper;awakening;voice;silence;dozing' adjectives='drowsy' verbs='interrupt;be;lift' valence='5.521' arousal='4.037' dominance='5.451'>the stream</entity> was as a drowsy whisper, ever interrupted by dozings and silences, ever lifted again in the awakenings.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='283'>The motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon. Sunshine and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees. The hum of the bees and the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound. And the drifting sound and drifting color seemed to weave together in the making of a delicate and intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place. It was a spirit of peace that was not of death, but of smooth-pulsing life, of quietude that was not silence, of movement that was not action, of repose that was quick with existence without being violent with struggle and travail. The spirit of the place was the spirit of the peace of the living, somnolent with the easement and content of prosperity, and undisturbed by rumors of far wars.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='284'>The red-coated, many-antlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the spirit of the place and dozed knee-deep in the cool, shaded pool. There seemed no flies to vex him and he was languid with rest.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='285'>But there came a time when the buck"s ears lifted and tensed with swift eagerness for sound. His head was turned down the canyon. His sensitive, quivering nostrils scented the air. His eyes could not pierce the green screen through which the stream rippled away, but to his ears came the voice of a man. It was a steady, monotonous, singsong voice. Once the buck heard the harsh clash of metal upon rock. At the sound he snorted with a sudden start that jerked him through the air from water to meadow, and his feet sank into the young velvet, while he pricked his ears and again scented the air. Then he stole across the tiny meadow, pausing once and again to listen, and faded away out of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='sound;meadow;wraith' adjectives='soft-footed;tiny' verbs='pause;steal;fade;listen' valence='5.605' arousal='3.949' dominance='5.273'>the canyon</entity> like a wraith, soft-footed and without sound.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='286'>The clash of steel-shod soles against the rocks began to be heard, and the man"s voice grew louder. It was raised in a sort of chant and became distinct with nearness, so that the words could be heard:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='294'>"A sound of scrambling accompanied the song, and the spirit of the place fled away on the heels of the red-coated buck. The green screen was burst asunder, and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the sloping side-hill. He was a deliberate sort of man. He took in the scene with one embracing glance, then ran his eyes over the details to verify the general impression. Then, and not until then, did he open his mouth in vivid and solemn approval:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='295'>"Smoke of life an" snakes of purgatory! Will you just look at that! Wood an" water an" grass an" a side-hill! A pocket-hunter"s delight an" a cayuse"s paradise!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='296'>From out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a miner"s pick and shovel and gold-pan. Then he crawled out himself into the open. He was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt, with hobnailed brogans on his feet, and on his head a hat whose shapelessness and stains advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and camp-smoke. He stood erect, seeing wide-eyed the secrecy of the scene and sensuously inhaling the warm, sweet breath of the canyon-garden through nostrils that dilated and quivered with delight. His eyes narrowed to laughing slits of blue, his face wreathed itself in joy, and his mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='297'>"Jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks, but that smells good to me! Talk about your attar o" roses an" cologne factories! They ain"t in it!"</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='299'>The man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its water. "Tastes good to me," he murmured, lifting his head and gazing across the pool at the side-hill, while he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. The side-hill attracted his attention. Still lying on his stomach, he studied the hill formation long and carefully. It was a practised eye that traveled up the slope to the crumbling canyon-wall and back and down again to the edge of the pool. He scrambled to his feet and favored the side-hill with a second survey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='300'>"Looks good to me," he concluded, picking up his pick and shovel and gold-pan.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='301'>He crossed the stream below the pool, stepping agilely from stone to stone. Where the side-hill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of dirt and put it into the gold-pan. He squatted down, holding the pan in his two hands, and partly immersing it in the stream. Then he imparted to the pan a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and out through the dirt and gravel. The larger and the lighter particles worked to the surface, and these, by a skilful dipping movement of the pan, he spilled out and over the edge. Occasionally, to expedite matters, he rested the pan and with his fingers raked out the large pebbles and pieces of rock.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='302'>The contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the smallest bits of gravel remained. At this stage he began to work very deliberately and carefully. It was fine washing, and he washed fine and finer, with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last the pan seemed empty of everything but water; but with a quick semi-circular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream, he disclosed a layer of black sand on the bottom of the pan. So thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint. He examined it closely. In the midst of it was a tiny golden speck. He dribbled a little water in over the depressed edge of the pan. With a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the bottom, turning the grains of black sand over and over. A second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='303'>The washing had now become very fine--fine beyond all need of ordinary placer-mining. He worked the black sand, a small portion at a time, up the shallow rim of the pan. Each small portion he examined sharply, so that his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over the edge and away. Jealously, bit by bit, he let the black sand slip away. A golden speck, no larger than a pin-point, appeared on the rim, and by his manipulation of the water it returned to the bottom of the pan. And in such fashion another speck was disclosed, and another. Great was his care of them. Like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden specks so that not one should be lost. At last, of the pan of dirt nothing remained but his golden herd. He counted it, and then, after all his labor, sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl of water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='304'>But his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet. "Seven," he muttered aloud, asserting the sum of the specks for which he had toiled so hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away. "Seven," he repeated, with the emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his memory.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='305'>He stood still a long while, surveying the hillside. In his eyes was a curiosity, new-aroused and burning. There was an exultance about his bearing and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh scent of game.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='306'>He moved down <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='panful;step;dirt' adjectives='few' verbs='move;take' valence='5.16875' arousal='4.12875' dominance='5.1575'>the stream</entity> a few steps and took a second panful of dirt.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='307'>Again came the careful washing, the jealous herding of the golden specks, and the wantonness with which he sent them flying into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='herding;speck;wantonness' adjectives='jealous;golden;careful' verbs='fly;wash;come;send' valence='5.73333333333' arousal='4.11111111111' dominance='5.48555555556'>the stream</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='308'>"Five," he muttered, and repeated, "five."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='309'>He could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan farther down the stream. His golden herds diminished. "Four, three, two, two, one," were his memory tabulations as he moved down the stream. When but one speck of gold rewarded his washing, he stopped and built a fire of dry twigs. Into this he thrust the gold-pan and burned it till it was blue-black. He held up the pan and examined it critically. Then he nodded approbation. Against such a color-background he could defy the tiniest yellow speck to elude him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='310'>Still moving down the stream, he panned again. A single speck was his reward. A third pan contained no gold at all. Not satisfied with this, he panned three times again, taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of one another. Each pan proved empty of gold, and the fact, instead of discouraging him, seemed to give him satisfaction. His elation increased with each barren washing, until he arose, exclaiming jubilantly:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='311'>"If it ain"t the real thing, may God knock off my head with sour apples!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='312'>Returning to where he had started operations, he began to pan up the stream. At first his golden herds increased--increased prodigiously.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='315'>"It"s just booful, the way it peters out," he exulted when a shovelful of dirt contained no more than a single speck of gold.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='318'>After a time, with a greater clashing of steel-shod feet on rock, he returned. The green screen was tremendously agitated. It surged back and forth in the throes of a struggle. There was a loud grating and clanging of metal. The man"s voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with imperativeness. A large body plunged and panted. There was a snapping and ripping and rending, and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse burst through the screen. On its back was a pack, and from this trailed broken vines and torn creepers. The animal gazed with astonished eyes at the scene into which it had been precipitated, then dropped its head to the grass and began contentedly to graze. A second horse scrambled into view, slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when its hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the meadow. It was riderless, though on its back was a high-horned Mexican saddle, scarred and discolored by long usage.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='319'>The man brought up the rear. He threw off pack and saddle, with an eye to camp location, and gave the animals their freedom to graze. He unpacked his food and got out frying-pan and coffee-pot. He gathered an armful of dry wood, and with a few stones made a place for his fire.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='320'>"My!" he said, "but I"ve got an appetite. I could scoff iron-filings an" horseshoe nails an" thank you kindly, ma"am, for a second helpin"."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='321'>He straightened up, and, while he reached for matches in the pocket of his overalls, his eyes traveled across the pool to the side-hill. His fingers had clutched the match-box, but they relaxed their hold and the hand came out empty. The man wavered perceptibly. He looked at his preparations for cooking and he looked at the hill.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='322'>"Guess I"ll take another whack at her," he concluded, starting to cross <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='ll' adjectives='' verbs='guess;conclude;cross;start;take;whack' valence='5.36625' arousal='3.98375' dominance='5.105'>the stream</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='323'>"They ain"t no sense in it, I know," he mumbled apologetically. "But keepin" grub back an hour ain"t go in" to hurt none, I reckon."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='324'>A few feet back from his first line of test-pans he started a second line. The sun dropped down the western sky, the shadows lengthened, but the man worked on. He began a third line of test-pans. He was cross-cutting the hillside, line by line, as he ascended. The center of each line produced the richest pans, while the ends came where no colors showed in the pan. And as he ascended the hillside the lines grew perceptibly shorter. The regularity with which their length diminished served to indicate that somewhere up the slope the last line would be so short as to have scarcely length at all, and that beyond could come only a point. The design was growing into an inverted "V." The converging sides of this "V" marked the boundaries of the gold-bearing dirt.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='325'>The apex of the "V" was evidently the man"s goal. Often he ran his eye along the converging sides and on up the hill, trying to divine the apex, the point where the gold-bearing dirt must cease. Here resided "Mr. Pocket"--for so <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='pocket;slope;mr.;point' adjectives='imaginary' verbs='reside;cry;address' valence='5.385' arousal='4.005' dominance='5.215'>the man</entity> familiarly addressed the imaginary point above him on the slope, crying out:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='326'>"Come down out o" that, Mr. Pocket! Be right smart an" agreeable, an" come down!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='327'>"All right," he would add later, in a voice resigned to determination. "All right, Mr. Pocket. It"s plain to me I got to come right up an" snatch you out bald-headed. An" I"ll do it! I"ll do it!" he would threaten still later.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='328'>Each pan he carried down to the water to wash, and as he went higher up the hill the pans grew richer, until he began to save the gold in an empty baking powder can which he carried carelessly in his hip-pocket. So engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight of oncoming night. It was not until he tried vainly to see the gold colors in the bottom of the pan that he realized the passage of time. He straightened up abruptly. An expression of whimsical wonderment and awe overspread his face as he drawled:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='329'>"Gosh darn my buttons! if I didn"t plumb forget dinner!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='330'>He stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his long-delayed fire. Flapjacks and bacon and warmed-over beans constituted his supper. Then he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals, listening to the night noises and watching the moonlight stream through the canyon. After that he unrolled his bed, took off his heavy shoes, and pulled the blankets up to his chin. His face showed white in the moonlight, like the face of a corpse. But it was a corpse that knew its resurrection, for <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='elbow;resurrection;corpse;hillside' adjectives='' verbs='gaze;be;rise;know' valence='5.687' arousal='3.802' dominance='5.462'>the man</entity> rose suddenly on one elbow and gazed across at his hillside.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='331'>"Good night, Mr. Pocket," he called sleepily. "Goodnight."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='332'>He slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the sun smote his closed eyelids, when he awoke with a start and looked about him until he had established the continuity of his existence and identified his present self with the days previously lived.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='333'>To dress, he had merely to buckle on his shoes. He glanced at his fireplace and at his hillside, wavered, but fought down the temptation and started <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='hillside;fireplace;temptation' adjectives='' verbs='start;glance;waver;fight' valence='5.235' arousal='4.815' dominance='5.23625'>the fire</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='334'>"Keep yer shirt on, Bill; keep yer shirt on," he admonished himself. "What"s the good of rushin"? No use in gettin" all het up an" sweaty.

So it"s up to you to go an" get it."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='335'>He cut a short pole at the water"s edge and drew from one of his pockets a bit of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='336'>"Mebbe they"ll bite in the early morning," he muttered, as he made his first cast into the pool. And a moment later he was gleefully crying: "What"d I tell you, eh? What"d I tell you?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='337'>He had no reel, nor any inclination to waste time, and by main strength, and swiftly, he drew out of the water a flashing ten-inch trout. Three more, caught in rapid succession, furnished his breakfast. When he came to the stepping-stones on his way to his hillside, he was struck by a sudden thought, and paused.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='338'>"I"d just better take a hike down-stream a ways," he said. "There"s no tellin" who may be snoopin" around."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='339'>But he crossed over on the stones, and with a "I really oughter take that hike," the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he fell to work.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='340'>At nightfall he straightened up. The small of his back was stiff from stooping toil, and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the protesting muscles, he said:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='341'>"Now what d"ye think of that? I clean forgot my dinner again! If I don"t watch out, I"ll sure be degeneratin" into a two-meal-a-day crank."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='342'>"Pockets is the hangedest things I ever see for makin" a man absent-minded," he communed that night, as he crawled into his blankets. Nor did he forget to call up the hillside, "Good night, Mr. Pocket! Good night!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='343'>Rising with the sun, and snatching a hasty breakfast, he was early at work. A fever seemed to be growing in him, nor did the increasing richness of the test-pans allay this fever. There was a flush in his cheek other than that made by the heat of the sun, and he was oblivious to fatigue and the passage of time. When he filled a pan with dirt, he ran down the hill to wash it; nor could he forbear running up the hill again, panting and stumbling profanely, to refill the pan.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='344'>He was now a hundred yards from the water, and the inverted "V" was assuming definite proportions. The width of the pay-dirt steadily decreased, and the man extended in his mind"s eye the sides of the "V" to their meeting place far up the hill. This was his goal, the apex of the "V," and he panned many times to locate it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='345'>"Just about two yards above that manzanita bush an" a yard to the right," he finally concluded.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='346'>Then the temptation seized him. "As plain as the nose on your face," he said, as he abandoned his laborious cross-cutting and climbed to the indicated apex. He filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash. It contained no trace of gold. He dug deep, and he dug shallow, filling and washing a dozen pans, and was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden speck. He was enraged at having yielded to the temptation, and berated himself blasphemously and pridelessly. Then he went down the hill and took up the cross-cutting.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='347'>"Slow an" certain, Bill; slow an" certain," he crooned. "Short-cuts to fortune ain"t in your line, an" it"s about time you know it. Get wise, Bill; get wise. Slow an" certain"s the only hand you can play; so go to it, an" keep to it, too."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='348'>As the cross-cuts decreased, showing that the sides of the "V" were converging, the depth of the "V" increased. The gold-trace was dipping into the hill. It was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he could get colors in his pan. The dirt he found at twenty-five inches from the surface, and at thirty-five inches yielded barren pans. At the base of the "V," by the water"s edge, he had found the gold colors at the grass roots. The higher he went up the hill, the deeper the gold dipped. To dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one test-pan was a task of no mean magnitude; while between the man and the apex intervened an untold number of such holes to be dug. "An" there"s no tellin" how much deeper it"ll pitch," he sighed, in a moment"s pause, while his fingers soothed his aching back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='349'>Feverish with desire, with aching back and stiffening muscles, with pick and shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth, the man toiled up the hill. Before him was the smooth slope, spangled with flowers and made sweet with their breath. Behind him was devastation. It looked like some terrible eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill. His slow progress was like that of a slug, befouling beauty with a monstrous trail.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='350'>Though the dipping gold-trace increased the man"s work, he found consolation in the increasing richness of the pans. Twenty cents, thirty cents, fifty cents, sixty cents, were the values of the gold found in the pans, and at nightfall he washed his banner pan, which gave him a dollar"s worth of gold-dust from a shovelful of dirt.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='351'>"I"ll just bet it"s my luck to have some inquisitive one come buttin" in here on my pasture," he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the blankets up to his chin.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='352'>Suddenly he sat upright. "Bill!" he called sharply. "Now, listen to me, Bill; d"ye hear! It"s up to you, to-morrow mornin", to mosey round an" see what you can see. Understand? To-morrow morning, an" don"t you forget it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='353'>He yawned and glanced across at his side-hill. "Good night, Mr. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='mr.;night' adjectives='good' verbs='call' valence='6.605' arousal='3.755' dominance='5.9025'>Pocket</entity>," he called.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='354'>In the morning he stole a march on the sun, for he had finished breakfast when its first rays caught him, and he was climbing the wall of the canyon where it crumbled away and gave footing. From the outlook at the top he found himself in the midst of loneliness. As far as he could see, chain after chain of mountains heaved themselves into his vision. To the east his eyes, leaping the miles between range and range and between many ranges, brought up at last against the white-peaked Sierras--the main crest, where the backbone of the Western world reared itself against the sky. To the north and south he could see more distinctly the cross-systems that broke through the main trend of the sea of mountains. To the west the ranges fell away, one behind the other, diminishing and fading into the gentle foothills that, in turn, descended into the great valley which he could not see.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='355'>And in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the handiwork of man--save only the torn bosom of the hillside at his feet. The man looked long and carefully. Once, far down his own canyon, he thought he saw in the air a faint hint of smoke. He looked again and decided that it was the purple haze of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wall;haze;convolution;back' adjectives='purple;dark' verbs='be;make;look;decide' valence='5.47833333333' arousal='3.62916666667' dominance='5.35'>the hills</entity> made dark by a convolution of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wall;haze;convolution;back' adjectives='purple;dark' verbs='be;make;look;decide' valence='5.47833333333' arousal='3.62916666667' dominance='5.35'>the canyon</entity> wall at its back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='356'>"Hey, you, Mr. Pocket!" he called down into the canyon. "Stand out from under! I"m a-comin", Mr. Pocket! I"m a-comin"!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='357'>The heavy brogans on the man"s feet made him appear clumsy-footed, but he swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain goat. A rock, turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice, did not disconcert him. He seemed to know the precise time required for the turn to culminate in disaster, and in the meantime he utilized the false footing itself for the momentary earth-contact necessary to carry him on into safety. Where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to stand for a second upright, the man did not hesitate. His foot pressed the impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave him the bound that carried him onward. Again, where even the fraction of a second"s footing was out of the question, he would swing his body past by a moment"s hand-grip on a jutting knob of rock, a crevice, or a precariously rooted shrub. At last, with a wild leap and yell, he exchanged the face of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='descent;face;leap;ton;earth;midst;gravel' adjectives='wild;several;last;earth-slide' verbs='yell;finish;slide;exchange' valence='5.37066666667' arousal='4.15066666667' dominance='5.22066666667'>the wall</entity> for an earth-slide and finished the descent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='358'>His first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold. It was from the centre of the "V." To either side the diminution in the values of the pans was swift. His lines of cross-cutting holes were growing very short. The converging sides of the inverted "V" were only a few yards apart. Their meeting-point was only a few yards above him. But the pay-streak was dipping deeper and deeper into the earth. By early afternoon he was sinking the test-holes five feet before the pans could show the gold-trace.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='359'>For that matter, the gold-trace had become something more than a trace; it was a placer mine in itself, and the man resolved to come back after he had found the pocket and work over the ground. But the increasing richness of the pans began to worry him.

Either Mr. Pocket"s spilled himself all out an" down the hill, or else Mr. Pocket"s so rich you maybe won"t be able to carry him all away with you. And that"d be an awful shame, wouldn"t it, now?"

Little yellow was to be seen, but with his strong fingers he crumbled the rotten quartz away till both hands were filled with glowing yellow. He rubbed the dirt away from fragment after fragment, tossing them into the gold-pan. It was a treasure-hole. So much had the quartz rotted away that there was less of it than there was of gold. Now and again he found a piece to which no rock clung--a piece that was all gold. A chunk, where the pick had laid open the heart of the gold, glittered like a handful of yellow jewels, and he cocked his head at it and slowly turned it around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='373'>Still squatting on his heels, he continued examining the fragments and tossing them into the pan. Suddenly there came to him a premonition of danger. It seemed a shadow had fallen upon him. But there was no shadow. His heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him. Then his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold against his flesh.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='374'>He did not spring up nor look around. He did not move. He was considering the nature of the premonition he had received, trying to locate the source of the mysterious force that had warned him, striving to sense the imperative presence of the unseen thing that threatened him. There is an aura of things hostile, made manifest by messengers too refined for the senses to know; and this aura he felt, but knew not how he felt it. His was the feeling as when a cloud passes over the sun. It seemed that between him and life had passed something dark and smothering and menacing; a gloom, as it were, that swallowed up life and made for death--his death.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='375'>Every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the unseen danger, but his soul dominated the panic, and he remained squatting on his heels, in his hands a chunk of gold.

He examined it critically, turned it over and over, and rubbed the dirt from it. And all the time he knew that something behind him was looking at the gold over his shoulder.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='376'>Still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand, he listened intently and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him. His eyes searched the ground in front of him for a weapon, but they saw only the uprooted gold, worthless to him now in his extremity. There was his pick, a handy weapon on occasion; but this was not such an occasion. The man realized his predicament. He was in a narrow hole that was seven feet deep. His head did not come to the surface of the ground. He was in a trap.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='377'>He remained squatting on his heels. He was quite cool and collected; but his mind, considering every factor, showed him only his helplessness. He continued rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the gold into the pan. There was nothing else for him to do.

He might rise up with a rush and claw his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even footing above ground. Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly, and feign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back. His instinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad, clawing rush to the surface. His intellect, and the craft thereof, favored the slow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could not see. And while he debated, a loud, crashing noise burst on his ear. At the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the back, and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his flesh. He sprang up in the air, but halfway to his feet collapsed. His body crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat, and he came down, his chest across his pan of gold, his face in the dirt and rock, his legs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole. His legs twitched convulsively several times. His body was shaken as with a mighty ague. There was a slow expansion of the lungs, accompanied by a deep sigh. Then the air was slowly, very slowly, exhaled, and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='379'>Above, revolver in hand, a man was peering down over the edge of the hole. He peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath him. After a while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that he could see into it, and rested the revolver on his knee. Reaching his hand into a pocket, he drew out a wisp of brown paper. Into this he dropped a few crumbs of tobacco. The combination became a cigarette, brown and squat, with the ends turned in. Not once did he take his eyes from the body at the bottom of the hole. He lighted the cigarette and drew its smoke into his lungs with a caressing intake of the breath. He smoked slowly. Once the cigarette went out and he relighted it. And all the while he studied the body beneath him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='380'>In the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet. He moved to the edge of the hole. Spanning it, a hand resting on each edge, and with the revolver still in the right hand, he muscled his body down into the hole. While his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he released his hands and dropped down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='381'>At the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocket-miner"s arm leap out, and his own legs knew a swift, jerking grip that overthrew him. In the nature of the jump his revolver hand was above his head. Swiftly as the grip had flashed about his legs, just as swiftly he brought the revolver down. He was still in the air, his fall in process of completion, when he pulled the trigger. The explosion was deafening in the confined space. The smoke filled the hole so that he could see nothing. He struck the bottom on his back, and like a cat"s the pocket-miner"s body was on top of him. Even as the miner"s body passed on top, the stranger crooked in his right arm to fire; and even in that instant the miner, with a quick thrust of elbow, struck his wrist. The muzzle was thrown up and the bullet thudded into the dirt of the side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='muzzle;side;bullet;dirt' adjectives='' verbs='be;thud;throw' valence='4.80875' arousal='4.13375' dominance='4.73125'>the hole</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='382'>The next instant the stranger felt the miner"s hand grip his wrist. The struggle was now for the revolver. Each man strove to turn it against the other"s body. The smoke in the hole was clearing. The stranger, lying on his back, was beginning to see dimly. But suddenly he was blinded by a handful of dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his antagonist. In that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken. In the next moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain, and in the midst of the darkness even the darkness ceased.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='383'>But the pocket-miner fired again and again, until the revolver was empty. Then he tossed it from him and, breathing heavily, sat down on the dead man"s legs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='384'>The miner was sobbing and struggling for breath. "Measly skunk!" he panted; "a-campin" on my trail an" lettin" me do the work, an" then shootin" me in the back!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='385'>He was half crying from anger and exhaustion. He peered at the face of the dead man. It was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel, and it was difficult to distinguish the features.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='386'>"Never laid eyes on him before," the miner concluded his scrutiny. "Just a common an" ordinary thief, hang him! An" he shot me in the back! He shot me in the back!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='387'>He opened his shirt and felt himself, front and back, on his left side.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='388'>"Went clean through, and no harm done!" he cried jubilantly. "I"ll bet he aimed all right all right; but he drew the gun over when he pulled the trigger--the cur! But I fixed "m! Oh, I fixed "m!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='389'>His fingers were investigating the bullet-hole in his side, and a shade of regret passed over his face. "It"s goin" to be stiffer"n hell," he said. "An" it"s up to me to get mended an" get out o"here."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='390'>He crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp. Half an hour later he returned, leading his pack-horse. His open shirt disclosed the rude bandages with which he had dressed his wound. He was slow and awkward with his left-hand movements, but that did not prevent his using the arm.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='391'>The bight of the pack-rope under the dead man"s shoulders enabled him to heave the body out of the hole. Then he set to work gathering up his gold. He worked steadily for several hours, pausing often to rest his stiffening shoulder and to exclaim:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='392'>"He shot me in the back, the measly skunk! He shot me in the back!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='393'>When his treasure was quite cleaned up and wrapped securely into a number of blanket-covered parcels, he made an estimate of its value.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='394'>He scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an unfamiliar groove. They quested along it for several inches. It was a crease through his scalp where the second bullet had ploughed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='395'>He walked angrily over to the dead man.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='396'>"You would, would you!" he bullied. "You would, eh? Well, I fixed you good an" plenty, an" I"ll give you decent burial, too. That"s more"n you"d have done for me."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='397'>He dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in. It struck the bottom with a dull crash, on its side, the face twisted up to the light. The miner peered down at it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='398'>"An" you shot me in the back!" he said accusingly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='399'>With pick and shovel he filled the hole. Then he loaded the gold on his horse. It was too great a load for the animal, and when he had gained his camp he transferred part of it to his saddle-horse. Even so, he was compelled to abandon a portion of his outfit--pick and shovel and gold-pan, extra food and cooking utensils, and divers odds and ends.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='400'>The sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen of vines and creepers. To climb the huge boulders the animals were compelled to uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of vegetation.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='401'>"The measly skunk!" he said, and disappeared.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='402'>There was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs. The trees surged back and forth, marking the passage of the animals through the midst of them. There was a clashing of steel-shod hoofs on stone, and now and again a sharp cry of command. Then the voice of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='voice;song' adjectives='' verbs='be;raise' valence='6.582' arousal='4.148' dominance='5.91'>the man</entity> was raised in song:--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='410'>The song grew faint and fainter, and through the silence crept back the spirit of the place.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='413'>THE STORY OF KEESH</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='414'>Keesh lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea, was head man of his village through many and prosperous years, and died full of honors with his name on the lips of men. So long ago did he live that only the old men remember his name, his name and the tale, which they got from the old men before them, and which the old men to come will tell to their children and their children"s children down to the end of time. And the winter darkness, when the north gales make their long sweep across the ice-pack, and the air is filled with flying white, and no man may venture forth, is the chosen time for the telling of how <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='north;ice-pack;power;igloo;sweep;air;gale;place;time;man;_;darkness' adjectives='white;poorest;long' verbs='fly;be;make;rise;choose;venture;tell;fill' valence='5.82' arousal='3.68428571429' dominance='5.65761904762'>Keesh</entity>, from the poorest _igloo_ in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='north;ice-pack;power;igloo;sweep;air;gale;place;time;man;_;darkness' adjectives='white;poorest;long' verbs='fly;be;make;rise;choose;venture;tell;fill' valence='5.82' arousal='3.68428571429' dominance='5.65761904762'>the village</entity>, rose to power and place over them all.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='415'>He was a bright boy, so the tale runs, healthy and strong, and he had seen thirteen suns, in their way of reckoning time. For each winter the sun leaves the land in darkness, and the next year a new sun returns so that they may be warm again and look upon one another"s faces. The father of Keesh had been a very brave man, but he had met his death in a time of famine, when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking the life of a great polar bear. In his eagerness he came to close grapples with the bear, and his bones were crushed; but the bear had much meat on him and the people were saved. Keesh was his only son, and after that Keesh lived alone with his mother. But the people are prone to forget, and they forgot the deed of his father; and he being but a boy, and his mother only a woman, they, too, were swiftly forgotten, and ere long came to live in the meanest of all the _igloos_.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='416'>It was at a council, one night, in the big _igloo_ of Klosh-Kwan, the chief, that Keesh showed the blood that ran in his veins and the manhood that stiffened his back. With the dignity of an elder, he rose to his feet, and waited for silence amid the babble of voices.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='417'>"It is true that meat be apportioned me and mine," he said. "But it is ofttimes old and tough, this meat, and, moreover, it has an unusual quantity of bones."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='418'>The hunters, grizzled and gray, and lusty and young, were aghast. The like had never been known before. A child, that talked like a grown man, and said harsh things to their very faces!</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='419'>But steadily and with seriousness, Keesh went on. "For that I know my father, Bok, was a great hunter, I speak these words. It is said that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='division;woman;eye;meat;share;hunter;hand;home;man' adjectives='fair;own;old;least;best' verbs='be;attend;receive;see;bring;say' valence='5.77833333333' arousal='3.88222222222' dominance='5.74055555556'>Bok</entity> brought home more meat than any of the two best hunters, that with his own hands he attended to the division of it, that with his own eyes he saw to it that the least old woman and the least old man received fair share."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='420'>"Na! Na!" the men cried. "Put the child out!" "Send him off to bed!" "He is no man that he should talk to men and gray-beards!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='421'>He waited calmly till the uproar died down.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='422'>"Thou hast a wife, Ugh-Gluk," he said, "and for her dost thou speak. And thou, too, Massuk, a mother also, and for them dost thou speak. My mother has no one, save me; wherefore I speak. As I say, though Bok be dead because he hunted over-keenly, it is just that I, who am his son, and that Ikeega, who is my mother and was his wife, should have meat in plenty so long as there be meat in plenty in the tribe. I, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='son' adjectives='' verbs='have;speak' valence='5.92' arousal='4.285' dominance='5.4025'>Keesh</entity>, the son of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='son' adjectives='' verbs='have;speak' valence='5.92' arousal='4.285' dominance='5.4025'>Bok</entity>, have spoken."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='423'>He sat down, his ears keenly alert to the flood of protest and indignation his words had created.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='424'>"That a boy should speak in council!" old Ugh-Gluk was mumbling.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='425'>"Shall the babes in arms tell us men the things we shall do?" Massuk demanded in a loud voice. "Am I a man that I should be made a mock by every child that cries for meat?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='426'>The anger boiled a white heat. They ordered him to bed, threatened that he should have no meat at all, and promised him sore beatings for his presumption. Keesh"s eyes began to flash, and the blood to pound darkly under his skin. In the midst of the abuse he sprang to his feet.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='427'>"Hear me, ye men!" he cried. "Never shall I speak in the council again, never again till the men come to me and say, "It is well, Keesh, that thou shouldst speak, it is well and it is our wish." Take this now, ye men, for my last word. Bok, my father, was a great hunter. I too, his son, shall go and hunt the meat that I eat. And be it known, now, that the division of that which I kill shall be fair. And no widow nor weak one shall cry in the night because there is no meat, when the strong men are groaning in great pain for that they have eaten overmuch. And in the days to come there shall be shame upon the strong men who have eaten overmuch. I, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='say;have' valence='5.59' arousal='4.31666666667' dominance='5.86666666667'>Keesh</entity>, have said it!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='428'>Jeers and scornful laughter followed him out of the _igloo_, but his jaw was set and he went his way, looking neither to right nor left.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='429'>The next day he went forth along the shoreline where the ice and the land met together. Those who saw him go noted that he carried his bow, with a goodly supply of bone-barbed arrows, and that across his shoulder was his father"s big hunting-spear. And there was laughter, and much talk, at the event. It was an unprecedented occurrence. Never did boys of his tender age go forth to hunt, much less to hunt alone. Also were there shaking of heads and prophetic mutterings, and the women looked pityingly at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='head;woman;muttering;face' adjectives='prophetic;grave;sad' verbs='be;look;shake' valence='5.196' arousal='4.074' dominance='5.301'>Ikeega</entity>, and her face was grave and sad.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='430'>"He will be back ere long," they said cheeringly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='431'>"Let him go; it will teach him a lesson," the hunters said. "And he will come back shortly, and he will be meek and soft of speech in the days to follow."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='432'>But a day passed, and a second, and on the third a wild gale blew, and there was no Keesh. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;grief;search;woman;word;face;hair;death;seal-oil;storm;soot;answer;man' adjectives='token;bitter' verbs='abate;prepare;tear;make;send;go;have;mistreat;put;assail' valence='5.30869565217' arousal='4.27869565217' dominance='5.44608695652'>Ikeega</entity> tore her hair and put soot of the seal-oil on her face in token of her grief; and the women assailed the men with bitter words in that they had mistreated <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='body;grief;search;woman;word;face;hair;death;seal-oil;storm;soot;answer;man' adjectives='token;bitter' verbs='abate;prepare;tear;make;send;go;have;mistreat;put;assail' valence='5.30869565217' arousal='4.27869565217' dominance='5.44608695652'>the boy</entity> and sent him to his death; and the men made no answer, preparing to go in search of the body when the storm abated.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='433'>Early next morning, however, Keesh strode into the village. But he came not shamefacedly. Across his shoulders he bore a burden of fresh-killed meat. And there was importance in his step and arrogance in his speech.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='434'>"Go, ye men, with the dogs and sledges, and take my trail for the better part of a day"s travel," he said. "There is much meat on the ice--a she-bear and two half-grown cubs."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='435'>Ikeega was overcome with joy, but he received her demonstrations in manlike fashion, saying: "Come, Ikeega, let us eat. And after that I shall sleep, for I am weary."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='436'>And he passed into their _igloo_ and ate profoundly, and after that slept for twenty running hours.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='437'>There was much doubt at first, much doubt and discussion. The killing of a polar bear is very dangerous, but thrice dangerous is it, and three times thrice, to kill a mother bear with her cubs. The men could not bring themselves to believe that the boy Keesh, single-handed, had accomplished so great a marvel. But the women spoke of the fresh-killed meat he had brought on his back, and this was an overwhelming argument against their unbelief. So they finally departed, grumbling greatly that in all probability, if the thing were so, he had neglected to cut up the carcasses. Now in the north it is very necessary that this should be done as soon as a kill is made. If not, the meat freezes so solidly as to turn the edge of the sharpest knife, and a three-hundred-pound bear, frozen stiff, is no easy thing to put upon a sled and haul over the rough ice. But arrived at the spot, they found not only the kill which they had doubted, but that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fashion;hunter;spot;beast;entrails;kill' adjectives='true' verbs='arrive;remove;doubt;have;quarter;find' valence='5.01307692308' arousal='4.41307692308' dominance='5.19307692308'>Keesh</entity> had quartered the beasts in true hunter fashion, and removed the entrails.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='438'>Thus began the mystery of Keesh, a mystery that deepened and deepened with the passing of the days. His very next trip he killed a young bear, nearly full-grown, and on the trip following, a large male bear and his mate. He was ordinarily gone from three to four days, though it was nothing unusual for him to stay away a week at a time on the ice-field. Always he declined company on these expeditions, and the people marveled. "How does he do it?" they demanded of one another. "Never does he take a dog with him, and dogs are of such great help, too."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='439'>"Why dost thou hunt only bear?" <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='ask;venture' valence='5.64' arousal='4.515' dominance='6.185'>Klosh-Kwan</entity> once ventured to ask.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='440'>And Keesh made fitting answer. "It is well known that there is more meat on the bear," he said.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='441'>But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village. "He hunts with evil spirits," some of the people contended, "wherefore his hunting is rewarded. How else can it be, save that he hunts with evil spirits?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='442'>"Mayhap they be not evil, but good, these spirits," others said. "It is known that his father was a mighty hunter. May not his father hunt with him so that he may attain excellence and patience and understanding? Who knows?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='443'>None the less, his success continued, and the less skilful hunters were often kept busy hauling in his meat. And in the division of it he was just. As his father had done before him, he saw to it that the least old woman and the last old man received a fair portion, keeping no more for himself than his needs required. And because of this, and of his merit as a hunter, he was looked upon with respect, and even awe; and there was talk of making him chief after old Klosh-Kwan. Because of the things he had done, they looked for him to appear again in the council, but he never came, and they were ashamed to ask.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='444'>"I am minded to build me an _igloo_," he said one day to Klosh-Kwan and a number of the hunters. "It shall be a large _igloo_, wherein Ikeega and I can dwell in comfort."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='445'>"Ay," they nodded gravely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='446'>"But I have no time. My business is hunting, and it takes all my time. So it is but just that the men and women of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='_;woman;meat;igloo;man' adjectives='' verbs='be;eat;build' valence='6.21125' arousal='4.00625' dominance='5.85125'>the village</entity> who eat my meat should build me my _igloo_."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='447'>And the _igloo_ was built accordingly, on a generous scale which exceeded even the dwelling of Klosh-Kwan. Keesh and his mother moved into it, and it was the first prosperity she had enjoyed since the death of Bok. Nor was material prosperity alone hers, for, because of her wonderful son and the position he had given her, she came to be looked upon as the first woman in all <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='prosperity;woman;advice;argument;son;hers;position;wisdom;man' adjectives='wonderful;material' verbs='be;look;give;quote;visit;have;arise;ask;come' valence='6.22076923077' arousal='3.96384615385' dominance='5.76653846154'>the village</entity>; and the women were given to visiting her, to asking her advice, and to quoting her wisdom when arguments arose among themselves or with the men.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='448'>But it was the mystery of Keesh"s marvelous hunting that took chief place in all their minds. And one day <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='face;witchcraft' adjectives='' verbs='tax' valence='5.152' arousal='4.128' dominance='5.066'>Ugh-Gluk</entity> taxed him with witchcraft to his face.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='450'>"Is not the meat good?" Keesh made answer. "Has one in the village yet to fall sick from the eating of it! How dost thou know that witchcraft be concerned? Or dost thou guess, in the dark, merely because of the envy that consumes thee?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='451'>And Ugh-Gluk withdrew discomfited, the women laughing at him as he walked away. But in the council one night, after long deliberation, it was determined to put spies on his track when he went forth to hunt, so that his methods might be learned. So, on his next trip, Bim and Bawn, two young men, and of hunters the craftiest, followed after him, taking care not to be seen. After five days they returned, their eyes bulging and their tongues a-tremble to tell what they had seen. The council was hastily called in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='tale;s;dwelling;council' adjectives='' verbs='be;call;take' valence='5.47714285714' arousal='3.82285714286' dominance='5.45142857143'>Klosh-Kwan</entity>"s dwelling, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='tale;s;dwelling;council' adjectives='' verbs='be;call;take' valence='5.47714285714' arousal='3.82285714286' dominance='5.45142857143'>Bim</entity> took up the tale.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='452'>"Brothers! As commanded, we journeyed on the trail of Keesh, and cunningly we journeyed, so that he might not know. And midway of the first day he picked up with a great he-bear. It was a very great bear."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='453'>"None greater," Bawn corroborated, and went on himself. "Yet was the bear not inclined to fight, for he turned away and made off slowly over the ice. This we saw from the rocks of the shore, and the bear came toward us, and after him came Keesh, very much unafraid. And he shouted harsh words after the bear, and waved his arms about, and made much noise. Then did the bear grow angry, and rise up on his hind legs, and growl. But <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='bear' adjectives='' verbs='walk' valence='6.47333333333' arousal='4.24666666667' dominance='5.52666666667'>Keesh</entity> walked right up to the bear."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='454'>"Ay," Bim continued the story. "Right up to the bear Keesh walked. And the bear took after him, and Keesh ran away. But as he ran he dropped a little round ball on the ice. And the bear stopped and smelled of it, and then swallowed it up. And <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ball;bear' adjectives='little;round' verbs='drop;continue;run;swallow' valence='5.63333333333' arousal='3.79666666667' dominance='5.26'>Keesh</entity> continued to run away and drop little round balls, and the bear continued to swallow them up."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='456'>"With our own eyes we saw it," Bim affirmed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='457'>And Bawn--"Ay, with our own eyes. And this continued until the bear stood suddenly upright and cried aloud in pain, and thrashed his forepaws madly about. And Keesh continued to make off over the ice to a safe distance. But the bear gave him no notice, being occupied with the misfortune the little round balls had wrought within him."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='458'>"Ay, within him," Bim interrupted. "For he did claw at himself, and leap about over the ice like a playful puppy, save from the way he growled and squealed it was plain it was not play but pain. Never did I see such a sight!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='459'>"Nay, never was such a sight seen," Bawn took up the strain. "And furthermore, it was such a large bear."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='460'>"Witchcraft," Ugh-Gluk suggested.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='461'>"I know not," Bawn replied. "I tell only of what my eyes beheld. And after a while the bear grew weak and tired, for he was very heavy and he had jumped about with exceeding violence, and he went off along the shore-ice, shaking his head slowly from side to side and sitting down ever and again to squeal and cry. And Keesh followed after the bear, and we followed after Keesh, and for that day and three days more we followed. The bear grew weak, and never ceased crying from his pain."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='462'>"It was a charm!" Ugh-Gluk exclaimed. "Surely it was a charm!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='463'>"It may well be."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='464'>And Bim relieved Bawn. "The bear wandered, now this way and now that, doubling back and forth and crossing his trail in circles, so that at the end he was near where Keesh had first come upon him.

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='468'>And curiosity was so strong on the men that the whole council, Klosh-Kwan to the fore, rose up and went to the _igloo_ of Keesh.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='470'>Keesh looked up and smiled. "Nay, O Klosh-Kwan. It is not for a boy to know aught of witches, and of witches I know nothing. I have but devised a means whereby I may kill the ice-bear with ease, that is all. It be headcraft, not witchcraft."</paragraph>

The bear swallows the little round ball, the blubber melts, the whalebone with its sharp ends stands out straight, the bear gets sick, and when the bear is very sick, why, you kill him with a spear. It is quite simple."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='478'>And Ugh-Gluk said "Oh!" and Klosh-Kwan said "Ah!" And each said something after his own manner, and all understood.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='479'>And this is the story of Keesh, who lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='491'>"Nam-Bok!" the old woman cried, so loud and clear that the whole village was startled and looked at her.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='492'>She struggled to her feet and tottered down the sand. She stumbled over a baby lying in the sun, and the mother hushed its crying and hurled harsh words after the old woman, who took no notice. The children ran down the beach in advance of her, and as the man in the bidarka drew closer, nearly capsizing with one of his ill-directed strokes, the women followed. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='three;two;tusk;man;walrus;staff' adjectives='' verbs='go;drop;lean;loiter' valence='5.6275' arousal='4.02125' dominance='5.4275'>Koogah</entity> dropped his walrus tusk and went also, leaning heavily upon his staff, and after him loitered the men in twos and threes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='493'>The bidarka turned broadside and the ripple of surf threatened to swamp it, only a naked boy ran into the water and pulled the bow high up on the sand. The man stood up and sent a questing glance along the line of villagers. A rainbow sweater, dirty and the worse for wear, clung loosely to his broad shoulders, and a red cotton handkerchief was knotted in sailor fashion about his throat. A fisherman"s tam-o"-shanter on his close-clipped head, and dungaree trousers and heavy brogans completed his outfit.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='494'>But he was none the less a striking personage to these simple fisherfolk of the great Yukon Delta, who, all their lives, had stared out on Bering Sea and in that time seen but two white men,--the census enumerator and a lost Jesuit priest. They were a poor people, with neither gold in the ground nor valuable furs in hand, so the whites had passed them afar. Also, the Yukon, through the thousands of years, had shoaled that portion of the sea with the detritus of Alaska till vessels grounded out of sight of land. So the sodden coast, with its long inside reaches and huge mud-land archipelagoes, was avoided by the ships of men, and the fisherfolk knew not that such things were.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='495'>Koogah, the Bone-Scratcher, retreated backward in sudden haste, tripping over his staff and falling to the ground. "Nam-Bok!" he cried, as he scrambled wildly for footing. "Nam-Bok, who was blown off to sea, come back!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='496'>The men and women shrank away, and the children scuttled off between their legs. Only Opee-Kwan was brave, as befitted the head man of the village. He strode forward and gazed long and earnestly at the newcomer.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='497'>"It is Nam-Bok," he said at last, and at the conviction in his voice the women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='498'>The lips of the stranger moved indecisively, and his brown throat writhed and wrestled with unspoken words.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='499'>"La, la, it is Nam-Bok," Bask-Wah-Wan croaked, peering up into his face. "Ever did I say Nam-Bok would come back."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='500'>"Ay, it is Nam-Bok come back." This time it was Nam-Bok himself who spoke, putting a leg over the side of the bidarka and standing with one foot afloat and one ashore. Again his throat writhed and wrestled as he grappled after forgotten words. And when the words came forth they were strange of sound and a spluttering of the lips accompanied the gutturals. "Greetings, O brothers," he said, "brothers of old time before I went away with the off-shore wind."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='501'>He stepped out with both feet on the sand, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='foot;sand' adjectives='' verbs='step;wave' valence='5.52' arousal='3.292' dominance='5.498'>Opee-Kwan</entity> waved him back.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='508'>But Opee-Kwan doubted, and brushed his hand across his brow in sore puzzlement. Nam-Bok was likewise puzzled, and as he looked up and down the line found no welcome in the eyes of the fisherfolk. The men and women whispered together. The children stole timidly back among their elders, and bristling dogs fawned up to him and sniffed suspiciously.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='512'>Nam-Bok cleared his throat and made answer. "In the old time long ago, thy father"s father, Opee-Kwan, went away and came back on the heels of the years. Nor was a place by the fire denied him. It is said ..." He paused significantly, and they hung on his utterance. "It is said," he repeated, driving his point home with deliberation, "that <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='deliberation;point;son;home;klooch;_' adjectives='' verbs='be;repeat;drive;bear;say;come' valence='5.8575' arousal='3.81333333333' dominance='5.575'>Sipsip</entity>, his _klooch_, bore him two sons after he came back."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='521'>There was little talk while the feast went on, though many and curious were the glances stolen at the son of Bask-Wah-Wan. This embarrassed him--not because he was modest of spirit, however, but for the fact that the stench of the seal-oil had robbed him of his appetite, and that he keenly desired to conceal his feelings on the subject.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='522'>"Eat; thou art hungry," Opee-Kwan commanded, and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;pot;art;fish;fist' adjectives='big;putrid;hungry' verbs='shut;command;eat;shove' valence='4.95583333333' arousal='4.25' dominance='5.58583333333'>Nam-Bok</entity> shut both his eyes and shoved his fist into the big pot of putrid fish.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='524'>In despair, when premonitory symptoms warned him that his stomach was not so strong as of old, he filled his pipe and struck up a smoke. The people fed on noisily and watched. Few of them could boast of intimate acquaintance with the precious weed, though now and again small quantities and abominable qualities were obtained in trade from the Eskimos to the northward. Koogah, sitting next to him, indicated that he was not averse to taking a draw, and between two mouthfuls, with the oil thick on his lips, sucked away at the amber stem. And thereupon Nam-Bok held his stomach with a shaky hand and declined the proffered return. Koogah could keep the pipe, he said, for he had intended so to honor him from the first. And the people licked their fingers and approved of his liberality.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='525'>Opee-Kwan rose to his feet. "And now, O Nam-Bok, the feast is ended, and we would listen concerning the strange things you have seen."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='526'>The fisherfolk applauded with their hands, and gathering about them their work, prepared to listen. The men were busy fashioning spears and carving on ivory, while the women scraped the fat from the hides of the hair seal and made them pliable or sewed muclucs with threads of sinew. Nam-Bok"s eyes roved over the scene, but there was not the charm about it that his recollection had warranted him to expect. During the years of his wandering he had looked forward to just this scene, and now that it had come he was disappointed. It was a bare and meagre life, he deemed, and not to be compared to the one to which he had become used. Still, he would open their eyes a bit, and his own eyes sparkled at the thought.</paragraph>

Bask Wah-Wan scolded and struggled, but was blown down the breach for a score of feet and left breathless and stranded in a heap of driftwood.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='639'>"But how can I get out of making a last raid?" I demanded, with the cocksureness of youth. "There always has to be a last, you know, to anything."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='640'>Charley crossed his legs, leaned back, and considered the problem. "Very true. But why not call the capture of Demetrios Contos the last? You"re back from it safe and sound and hearty, for all your good wetting, and--and----" His voice broke and he could not speak for a moment. "And I could never forgive myself if anything happened to you now."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='641'>I laughed at Charley"s fears while I gave in to the claims of his affection, and agreed to consider the last raid already performed. We had been together for two years, and now I was leaving the fish patrol in order to go back and finish my education. I had earned and saved money to put me through three years at the high school, and though the beginning of the term was several months away, I intended doing a lot of studying for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='school;money;term;examination;lot;beginning' adjectives='high' verbs='be;earn;intend;do;study;have;put;save' valence='5.75590909091' arousal='4.09409090909' dominance='5.63909090909'>the entrance</entity> examinations.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='642'>My belongings were packed snugly in a sea-chest, and I was all ready to buy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when Neil Partington arrived in Benicia. The _Reindeer_ was needed immediately for work far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he intended to run straight for Oakland. As that was his home and as I was to live with his family while going to school, he saw no reason, he said, why I should not put my chest aboard and come along.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='643'>So the chest went aboard, and in the middle of the afternoon we hoisted the _Reindeer"s_ big mainsail and cast off. It was tantalizing fall weather. The sea-breeze, which had blown steadily all summer, was gone, and in its place were capricious winds and murky skies which made the time of arriving anywhere extremely problematical. We started on the first of the ebb, and as we slipped down the Carquinez Straits, I looked my last for some time upon Benicia and the bight at Turner"s Shipyard, where we had besieged the _Lancashire Queen,_ and had captured Big Alec, the King of the Greeks. And at the mouth of the Straits I looked with not a little interest upon the spot where a few days before I should have drowned but for the good that was in the nature of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='spot;strait;mouth;interest;nature' adjectives='little;good' verbs='be;drown;look;have' valence='5.64866666667' arousal='4.19933333333' dominance='5.27133333333'>Demetrios Contos</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='644'>A great wall of fog advanced across San Pablo Bay to meet us, and in a few minutes the _Reindeer_ was running blindly through the damp obscurity. Charley, who was steering, seemed to have an instinct for that kind of work. How he did it, he himself confessed that he did not know; but he had a way of calculating winds, currents, distance, time, drift, and sailing speed that was truly marvellous.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='645'>"It looks as though it were lifting," Neil Partington said, a couple of hours after we had entered the fog.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='653'>The three of us were peering intently in that direction, when the _Reindeer_ struck with a dull crash and came to a standstill. We ran forward, and found her bowsprit entangled in the tanned rigging of a short, chunky mast. She had collided, head on, with a Chinese junk lying at anchor.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='654'>At the moment we arrived forward, five Chinese, like so many bees, came swarming out of the little "tween-decks cabin, the sleep still in their eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='655'>Leading them came a big, muscular man, conspicuous for his pock-marked face and the yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his head. It was Yellow Handkerchief, the Chinaman whom we had arrested for illegal shrimp-fishing the year before, and who, at that time, had nearly sunk the _Reindeer_, as he had nearly sunk it now by violating the rules of navigation.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='656'>"What d"ye mean, you yellow-faced heathen, lying here in a fairway without a horn a-going?" <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='cry' valence='3.22' arousal='5.45' dominance='2.56'>Charley</entity> cried hotly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='657'>"Mean?" Neil calmly answered. "Just take a look--that"s what he means."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='658'>Our eyes followed the direction indicated by Neil"s finger, and we saw the open amidships of the junk, half filled, as we found on closer examination, with fresh-caught shrimps. Mingled with the shrimps were myriads of small fish, from a quarter of an inch upward in size. Yellow Handkerchief had lifted the trap-net at high-water slack, and, taking advantage of the concealment offered by the fog, had boldly been lying by, waiting to lift the net again at low-water slack.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='659'>"Well," Neil hummed and hawed, "in all my varied and extensive experience as a fish patrolman, I must say this is the easiest capture I ever made.

	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='660'>"Tow the junk into San Rafael, of course," came the answer. Charley turned to me. "You stand by the junk, lad, and I"ll pass you a towing line.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='661'>So saying, Charley and Neil returned to the _Reindeer_ and got under way, the junk towing astern. I went aft and took charge of the prize, steering by means of an antiquated tiller and a rudder with large, diamond-shaped holes, through which the water rushed back and forth.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='663'>The wind, coming off the land, was rather puffy and uncertain, and it would have been more to our advantage had it been stronger. San Rafael Creek, up which we had to go to reach the town and turn over our prisoners to the authorities, ran through wide-stretching marshes, and was difficult to navigate on a falling tide, while at low tide it was impossible to navigate at all. So, with the tide already half-ebbed, it was necessary for us to make time. This the heavy junk prevented, lumbering along behind and holding the _Reindeer_ back by just so much dead weight.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='664'>"Tell those coolies to get up that sail," Charley finally called to me. "We don"t want to hang up on the mud flats for the rest of the night."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='665'>I repeated the order to Yellow Handkerchief, who mumbled it huskily to his men. He was suffering from a bad cold, which doubled him up in convulsive coughing spells and made his eyes heavy and bloodshot. This made him more evil-looking than ever, and when he glared viciously at me I remembered with a shiver the close shave I had had with him at the time of his previous arrest.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='666'>His crew sullenly tailed on to the halyards, and the strange, outlandish sail, lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown, rose in the air. We were sailing on the wind, and when Yellow Handkerchief flattened down the sheet the junk forged ahead and the tow-line went slack. Fast as the _Reindeer_ could sail, the junk outsailed her; and to avoid running her down I hauled a little closer on the wind. But the junk likewise outpointed, and in a couple of minutes I was abreast of the _Reindeer_ and to windward. The tow-line had now tautened, at right angles to the two boats, and the predicament was laughable.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='667'>"Cast off!" I shouted.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='668'><entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='hesitate' valence='4.0' arousal='3.96' dominance='4.59'>Charley</entity> hesitated.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='3' num='669'>"It"s all right," I added. "Nothing can happen.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='670'>At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent one of his men forward to haul in the line. In the gathering darkness I could just make out the mouth of San Rafael Creek, and by the time we entered it I could barely see its banks. The _Reindeer_ was fully five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow, winding channel. With <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='eye;darkness;coat;revolver;hand;pocket;trousers;prisoner;side' adjectives='sharp;little' verbs='prevent;transfer;keep;have;put;seem;fear' valence='5.11541666667' arousal='4.28208333333' dominance='5.29375'>Charley</entity> behind us, it seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them, so I transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put my hand on it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='671'>Yellow Handkerchief was the one I feared, and that he knew it and made use of it, subsequent events will show. He was sitting a few feet away from me, on what then happened to be the weather side of the junk. I could scarcely see the outlines of his form, but I soon became convinced that he was slowly, very slowly, edging closer to me. I watched him carefully. Steering with my left hand, I slipped my right into my pocket and got hold of the revolver.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='672'>I saw him shift along for a couple of inches, and I was just about to order him back--the words were trembling on the tip of my tongue--when I was struck with great force by a heavy figure that had leaped through the air upon me from the lee side. It was one of the crew. He pinioned my right arm so that I could not withdraw my hand from my pocket, and at the same time clapped his other hand over my mouth. Of course, I could have struggled away from him and freed my hand or gotten my mouth clear so that I might cry an alarm, but in a trice Yellow Handkerchief was on top of me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='673'>I struggled around to no purpose in the bottom of the junk, while my legs and arms were tied and my mouth securely bound in what I afterward found to be a cotton shirt. Then I was left lying in the bottom. Yellow Handkerchief took the tiller, issuing his orders in whispers; and from our position at the time, and from the alteration of the sail, which I could dimly make out above me as a blot against the stars, I knew the junk was being headed into the mouth of a small slough which emptied at that point into <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='junk;blot;star;handkerchief;point;whisper;sail;alteration;mouth;slough;time;position;tiller;order' adjectives='small;yellow' verbs='be;head;make;take;issue;empty;know' valence='5.50357142857' arousal='3.92357142857' dominance='5.37357142857'>San Rafael Creek</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='674'>In a couple of minutes we ran softly alongside the bank, and the sail was silently lowered. The Chinese kept very quiet. Yellow Handkerchief sat down in the bottom alongside of me, and I could feel him straining to repress his raspy, hacking cough.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='678'>It was all very flattering to me, but lying there, bound and gagged by my own prisoners, with the voices growing faint and fainter as the _Reindeer_ slipped on through the darkness toward San Rafael, I must say I was not in quite the proper situation to enjoy my smiling future. With the _Reindeer_ went my last hope. What was to happen next I could not imagine, for the Chinese were a different race from mine and from what I knew I was confident that fair play was no part of their make-up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='679'>After waiting a few minutes longer, the crew hoisted the lateen sail, and Yellow Handkerchief steered down toward the mouth of San Rafael Creek. The tide was getting lower, and he had difficulty in escaping the mud-banks.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='680'>As we passed out of the creek a noisy discussion arose, which I knew related to me. Yellow Handkerchief was vehement, but the other four as vehemently opposed him. It was very evident that he advocated doing away with me and that they were afraid of the consequences. I was familiar enough with the Chinese character to know that fear alone restrained them. But what plan they offered in place of Yellow Handkerchief"s murderous one, I could not make out.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='681'>My feelings, as my fate hung in the balance, may be guessed. The discussion developed into a quarrel, in the midst of which Yellow Handkerchief unshipped the heavy tiller and sprang toward me. But his four companions threw themselves between, and a clumsy struggle took place for possession of the tiller. In the end Yellow Handkerchief was overcome, and sullenly returned to the steering, while they soundly berated him for his rashness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='682'>Not long after, the sail was run down and the junk slowly urged forward by means of the sweeps. I felt it ground gently on the soft mud. Three of the Chinese--they all wore long sea-boots--got over the side, and the other two passed me across the rail. With Yellow Handkerchief at my legs and his two companions at my shoulders, they began to flounder along through the mud. After some time their feet struck firmer footing, and I knew they were carrying me up some beach. The location of this beach was not doubtful in my mind. It could be none other than one of the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shore;none;group;islet' adjectives='other;rocky' verbs='be;lay' valence='5.68857142857' arousal='3.58714285714' dominance='5.68142857143'>Marin Islands</entity>, a group of rocky islets which lay off the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shore;none;group;islet' adjectives='other;rocky' verbs='be;lay' valence='5.68857142857' arousal='3.58714285714' dominance='5.68142857143'>Marin County</entity> shore.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='683'>When they reached the firm sand that marked high tide, I was dropped, and none too gently. Yellow Handkerchief kicked me spitefully in the ribs, and then the trio floundered back through the mud to the junk. A moment later I heard the sail go up and slat in the wind as they drew in the sheet. Then silence fell, and I was left to my own devices for getting free.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='684'>I remembered having seen tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes with which they were bound, but though I writhed and squirmed like a good fellow, the knots remained as hard as ever, and there was no appreciable slack. In the course of my squirming, however, I rolled over upon a heap of clam-shells--the remains, evidently, of some yachting party"s clam-bake. This gave me an idea. My hands were tied behind my back; and, clutching a shell in them, I rolled over and over, up <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shell;back;hand' adjectives='' verbs='be;clutch;know;tie;come;roll' valence='5.644375' arousal='3.921875' dominance='5.366875'>the beach</entity>, till I came to <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='shell;back;hand' adjectives='' verbs='be;clutch;know;tie;come;roll' valence='5.644375' arousal='3.921875' dominance='5.366875'>the rocks</entity> I knew to be there.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='685'>Rolling around and searching, I finally discovered a narrow crevice, into which I shoved the shell. The edge of it was sharp, and across the sharp edge I proceeded to saw the rope that bound my wrists. The edge of the shell was also brittle, and I broke it by bearing too heavily upon it. Then I rolled back to the heap and returned with as many shells as I could carry in both hands. I broke many shells, cut my hands a number of times, and got cramps in my legs from my strained position and my exertions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='686'>While I was suffering from the cramps, and resting, I heard a familiar halloo drift across the water. It was Charley, searching for me.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='687'>I returned to the sawing process, and at the end of half an hour succeeded in severing the rope. The rest was easy. My hands once free, it was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the gag out of my mouth. I ran around the island to make sure it _was_ an island and not by any chance a portion of the mainland. An island it certainly was, one of the Marin group, fringed with a sandy beach and surrounded by a sea of mud. Nothing remained but to wait till daylight and to keep warm; for it was a cold, raw night for <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='nothing;wind;skin' adjectives='raw;cold;warm;enough' verbs='be;pierce;keep;remain;shiver;cause;wait' valence='5.58933333333' arousal='3.73933333333' dominance='5.25066666667'>California</entity>, with just enough wind to pierce the skin and cause one to shiver.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='688'>To keep up the circulation, I ran around the island a dozen times or so, and clambered across its rocky backbone as many times more--all of which was of greater service to me, as I afterward discovered, than merely to warm me up. In the midst of this exercise I wondered if I had lost anything out of my pockets while rolling over and over in the sand. A search showed the absence of my revolver and pocket-knife. The first Yellow Handkerchief had taken; but the knife had been lost in the sand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='689'>I was hunting for it when the sound of rowlocks came to my ears. At first, of course, I thought of Charley; but on second thought I knew Charley would be calling out as he rowed along. A sudden premonition of danger seized me. The Marin Islands are lonely places; chance visitors in the dead of night are hardly to be expected. What if it were Yellow Handkerchief? The sound made by the rowlocks grew more distinct. I crouched in the sand and listened intently. The boat, which I judged a small skiff from the quick stroke of the oars, was landing in the mud about fifty yards up the beach. I heard a raspy, hacking cough, and my heart stood still. It was Yellow Handkerchief. Not to be robbed of his revenge by his more cautious companions, he had stolen away from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='revenge;companion' adjectives='cautious' verbs='come;be;rob;steal;have' valence='4.77818181818' arousal='4.10181818182' dominance='5.16909090909'>the village</entity> and come back alone.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='690'>I did some swift thinking. I was unarmed and helpless on a tiny islet, and a yellow barbarian, whom I had reason to fear, was coming after me. Any place was safer than the island, and I turned instinctively to the water, or rather to the mud. As he began to flounder ashore through the mud, I started to flounder out into it, going over the same course which the Chinese had taken in landing me and in returning to the junk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='691'>Yellow Handkerchief, believing me to be lying tightly bound, exercised no care, but came ashore noisily. This helped me, for, under the shield of his noise and making no more myself than necessary, I managed to cover fifty feet by the time he had made the beach. Here I lay down in the mud. It was cold and clammy, and made me shiver, but I did not care to stand up and run the risk of being discovered by his sharp eyes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='692'>He walked down the beach straight to where he had left me lying, and I had a fleeting feeling of regret at not being able to see his surprise when he did not find me. But it was a very fleeting regret, for my teeth were chattering with the cold.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='693'>What his movements were after that I had largely to deduce from the facts of the situation, for I could scarcely see him in the dim starlight. But I was sure that the first thing he did was to make the circuit of the beach to learn if landings had been made by other boats. This he would have known at once by the tracks through the mud.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='694'>Convinced that no boat had removed me from the island, he next started to find out what had become of me. Beginning at the pile of clam-shells, he lighted matches to trace my tracks in the sand. At such times I could see his villainous face plainly, and, when the sulphur from the matches irritated his lungs, between the raspy cough that followed and the clammy mud in which I was lying, I confess I shivered harder than ever.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='695'>The multiplicity of my footprints puzzled him. Then the idea that I might be out in the mud must have struck him, for he waded out a few yards in my direction, and, stooping, with his eyes searched the dim surface long and carefully. He could not have been more than fifteen feet from me, and had he lighted a match he would surely have discovered me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='696'>He returned to the beach and clambered about over the rocky backbone, again hunting for me with lighted matches. The closeness of the shave impelled me to further flight. Not daring to wade upright, on account of the noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud, I remained lying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface by means of my hands. Still keeping the trail made by the Chinese in going from and to the junk, I held on until I reached the water. Into this I waded to a depth of three feet, and then I turned off to the side on a line parallel with <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='into;side;depth;foot;line;parallel' adjectives='' verbs='wade;turn' valence='5.33333333333' arousal='4.0275' dominance='5.37583333333'>the beach</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='697'>The thought came to me of going toward Yellow Handkerchief"s skiff and escaping in it, but at that very moment he returned to the beach, and, as though fearing the very thing I had in mind, he slushed out through the mud to assure himself that the skiff was safe. This turned me in the opposite direction. Half swimming, half wading, with my head just out of water and avoiding splashing, I succeeded in putting about a hundred feet between myself and the spot where the Chinese had begun to wade ashore from the junk. I drew myself out on the mud and remained lying flat.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='698'>Again Yellow Handkerchief returned to the beach and made a search of the island, and again he returned to the heap of clam-shells. I knew what was running in his mind as well as he did himself. No one could leave or land without making tracks in the mud. The only tracks to be seen were those leading from his skiff and from where the junk had been. I was not on the island. I must have left it by one or the other of those two tracks. He had just been over the one to his skiff, and was certain I had not left that way. Therefore I could have left the island only by going over the tracks of the junk landing. This he proceeded to verify by wading out over them himself, lighting matches as he came along.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='699'>When he arrived at the point where I had first lain, I knew, by the matches he burned and the time he took, that he had discovered the marks left by my body. These he followed straight to the water and into it, but in three feet of water he could no longer see them. On the other hand, as the tide was still falling, he could easily make out the impression made by the junk"s bow, and could have likewise made out the impression of any other boat if it had landed at that particular spot. But there was no such mark; and I knew that he was absolutely convinced that I was hiding somewhere in the mud.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='700'>But to hunt on a dark night for a boy in a sea of mud would be like hunting for a needle in a haystack, and he did not attempt it. Instead he went back to the beach and prowled around for some time. I was hoping he would give me up and go, for by this time I was suffering severely from the cold. At last he waded out to his skiff and rowed away. What if this departure of Yellow Handkerchief"s were a sham? What if he had done it merely to entice me ashore?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='701'>The more I thought of it the more certain I became that he had made a little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away. So I remained, lying in the mud and shivering. I shivered till the muscles of the small of my back ached and pained me as badly as the cold, and I had need of all my self-control to force myself to remain in my miserable situation.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='702'>It was well that I did, however, for, possibly an hour later, I thought I could make out something moving on the beach. I watched intently, but my ears were rewarded first, by a raspy cough I knew only too well. Yellow Handkerchief had sneaked back, landed on the other side of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='side;handkerchief' adjectives='other;yellow' verbs='land;return;sneak;have;surprise;creep' valence='5.57' arousal='4.03466666667' dominance='5.48466666667'>the island</entity>, and crept around to surprise me if I had returned.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='703'>After that, though hours passed without sign of him, I was afraid to return to the island at all. On the other hand, I was almost equally afraid that I should die of the exposure I was undergoing. I had never dreamed one could suffer so. I grew so cold and numb, finally, that I ceased to shiver. But my muscles and bones began to ache in a way that was agony. The tide had long since begun to rise and, foot by foot, it drove me in toward the beach. High water came at three o"clock, and at three o"clock I drew myself up on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='water;resistance;o;clock' adjectives='high;helpless;alive;dead;more' verbs='draw;come;swoop;have;offer' valence='5.34608695652' arousal='4.19826086957' dominance='5.25826086957'>the beach</entity>, more dead than alive, and too helpless to have offered any resistance had Yellow Handkerchief swooped down upon me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='704'>But no Yellow Handkerchief appeared. He had given me up and gone back to Point Pedro. Nevertheless, I was in a deplorable, not to say a dangerous, condition. I could not stand upon my feet, much less walk. My clammy, muddy garments clung to me like sheets of ice. I thought I should never get them off. So numb and lifeless were my fingers, and so weak was I that it seemed to take an hour to get off my shoes. I had not the strength to break the porpoise-hide laces, and the knots defied me. I repeatedly beat my hands upon the rocks to get some sort of life into them. Sometimes I felt sure I was going to die.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='705'>But in the end,--after several centuries, it seemed to me,--I got off the last of my clothes. The water was now close at hand, and I crawled painfully into it and washed the mud from my naked body. Still, I could not get on my feet and walk and I was afraid to lie still. Nothing remained but to crawl weakly, like a snail, and at the cost of constant pain, up and down the sand. I kept this up as long as possible, but as the east paled with the coming of dawn I began to succumb. The sky grew rosy-red, and the golden rim of the sun, showing above the horizon, found me lying helpless and motionless among the clam-shells.</paragraph>

Perhaps he was strained most of all, for upon him rested the responsibility of that titanic struggle. He slept most of the time in his clothes, though he rarely slept. He haunted the deck at night, a great, burly, robust ghost, black with the sunburn of thirty years of sea and hairy as an orang-utan. He, in turn, was haunted by one thought of action, a sailing direction for the Horn: _Whatever you do, make westing! make westing!_ It was an obsession. He thought of nothing else, except, at times, to blaspheme God for sending such bitter weather.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='715'>On an average of once a week Captain Dan Cullen caught glimpses of the sun. Once, for ten minutes, the sun shone at midday, and ten minutes afterward a new gale was piping up, both watches were shortening sail, and all was buried in the obscurity of a driving snow-squall. For a fortnight, once, Captain Dan Cullen was without a meridian or a chronometer sight. Rarely did he know his position within half a degree, except when in sight of land; for sun and stars remained hidden behind the sky, and it was so gloomy that even at the best the horizons were poor for accurate observations. A gray gloom shrouded the world. The clouds were gray; the great driving seas were leaden gray gloom shrouded the world. The clouds were gray; the great driving seas were leadening; even the occasional albatrosses were gray, while the snow-flurries were not white, but gray, under the sombre pall of the heavens.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='716'>Life on board the _Mary Rogers_ was gray,--gray and gloomy. The faces of the sailors were blue-gray; they were afflicted with sea-cuts and sea-boils, and suffered exquisitely. They were shadows of men. For seven weeks, in the forecastle or on deck, they had not known what it was to be dry. They had forgotten what it was to sleep out a watch, and all watches it was, "All hands on deck!" They caught snatches of agonized sleep, and they slept in their oilskins ready for the everlasting call. So weak and worn were they that it took both watches to do the work of one. That was why both watches were on deck so much of the time. And no shadow of a man could shirk duty. Nothing less than a broken leg could enable a man to knock off work; and there were two such, who had been mauled and pulped by the seas that broke aboard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='717'>One other man who was the shadow of a man was George Dorety. He was the only passenger on board, a friend of the firm, and he had elected to make the voyage for his health. But seven weeks of Cape Horn had not bettered his health. He gasped and panted in his bunk through the long, heaving nights; and when on deck he was so bundled up for warmth that he resembled a peripatetic old-clothes shop. At midday, eating at the cabin table in a gloom so deep that the swinging sea-lamps burned always, he looked as blue-gray as the sickest, saddest man for"ard. Nor did gazing across the table at Captain Dan Cullen have any cheering effect upon him. Captain Cullen chewed and scowled and kept silent. The scowls were for God, and with every chew he reiterated the sole thought of his existence, which was _make westing._ He was a big, hairy brute, and the sight of him was not stimulating to the other"s appetite. He looked upon <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='god;meal;passenger' adjectives='' verbs='transfer;scowl;look;tell' valence='5.22333333333' arousal='4.13555555556' dominance='5.26555555556'>George Dorety</entity> as a <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='god;meal;passenger' adjectives='' verbs='transfer;scowl;look;tell' valence='5.22333333333' arousal='4.13555555556' dominance='5.26555555556'>Jonah</entity>, and told him so, once each meal, savagely transferring the scowl from God to the passenger and back again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='718'>On Saturday morning, July 24, George Dorety awoke to a feeling of life and headlong movement. On deck he found the _Mary Rogers_ running off before a howling southeaster. Nothing was set but the lower topsails and the foresail. It was all she could stand, yet she was making fourteen knots, as Mr. Turner shouted in Dorety"s ear when he came on deck. And it was all westing. She was going around the Horn at last ... if the wind held. Mr. Turner looked happy. The end of the struggle was in sight. But Captain Cullen did not look happy. He scowled at Dorety in passing. Captain Cullen did not want God to know that he was pleased with that wind. He had a conception of a malicious God, and believed in his secret soul that if God knew it was a desirable wind, God would promptly efface it and send a snorter from the west. So he walked softly before God, smothering his joy down under scowls and muttered curses, and, so, fooling God, for God was the only thing in the universe of which <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='god;thing;curse;universe;joy' adjectives='only;afraid' verbs='fool;be;smother;mutter;scowl;walk' valence='5.09533333333' arousal='4.522' dominance='4.88333333333'>Dan Cullen</entity> was afraid.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='719'>All Saturday and Saturday night the _Mary Rogers_ raced her westing. Persistently she logged her fourteen knots, so that by Sunday morning she had covered three hundred and fifty miles. If the wind held, she would make around. If it failed, and the snorter came from anywhere between southwest and north, back the _Mary Rogers_ would be hurled and be no better off than she had been seven weeks before. And on Sunday morning the wind _was_ failing. The big sea was going down and running smooth. Both watches were on deck setting sail after sail as fast as the ship could stand it. And now Captain Cullen went around brazenly before God, smoking a big cigar, smiling jubilantly, as if the failing wind delighted him, while down underneath he was raging against God for taking the life out of the blessed wind. _Make westing_! So he would, if God would only leave him alone. Secretly, he pledged himself anew to the Powers of Darkness, if they would let him make westing. He pledged himself so easily because he did not believe in the Powers of Darkness. He really believed only in God, though he did not know it. And in his inverted theology God was really the Prince of Darkness.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='720'>At midday, after calling eight bells, Captain Cullen ordered the royals on. The men went aloft faster than they had gone in weeks. Not alone were they nimble because of the westing, but a benignant sun was shining down and limbering their stiff bodies. George Dorety stood aft, near Captain Cullen, less bundled in clothes than usual, soaking in the grateful warmth as he watched the scene. Swiftly and abruptly the incident occurred. There was a cry from the foreroyal-yard of "Man overboard!" Somebody threw a life buoy over the side, and at the same instant the second mate"s voice came aft, ringing and peremptory:--</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='722'>The man at the wheel never moved a spoke. He knew better, for Captain Dan Cullen was standing alongside of him.

Astern, and going astern fast, could be seen the sailor. He had caught the life buoy and was clinging to it. Nobody spoke. Nobody moved. The men aloft clung to the royal yards and watched with terror stricken faces. And the _Mary Rogers_ raced on, making her westing. A long, silent minute passed.</paragraph>

He strolled carelessly, glancing at the passenger out of the corner of his eye. Dorety was looking the other way, standing with head and shoulders outside the companionway, and only the back of his head was to be seen. Captain Cullen, with swift eye, embraced the mainstaysail-block and the head and estimated the distance. He glanced about him. Nobody was looking. Aft, Joshua Higgins, pacing up and down, had just turned his back and was going the other way. Captain Cullen bent over suddenly and cast the staysail-sheet off from its pin.

Without doubt I had seen him with the rest of the kanaka crew on board, but I had not consciously been aware of his existence, for the _Petite Jeanne_ was rather overcrowded. In addition to her eight or ten kanaka seamen, her white captain, mate, and supercargo, and her six cabin passengers, she sailed from <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='box;supercargo;woman;paumotans;passenger;addition;blanket;deck;trade;sleeping-mat;mate;something;clothes-bundle;child;nothing;captain;cabin;man' adjectives='white' verbs='say;sail' valence='5.874' arousal='3.886' dominance='5.6175'>Rangiroa</entity> with something like eighty-five deck passengers--Paumotans and Tahitians, men, women, and children each with a trade box, to say nothing of sleeping-mats, blankets, and clothes-bundles.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='757'>Of course, the _Petite Jeanne_ was overloaded. She was only seventy tons, and she had no right to carry a tithe of the mob she had on board. Beneath her hatches she was crammed and jammed with pearl-shell and copra. Even the trade room was packed full of shell. It was a miracle that the sailors could work her. There was no moving about the decks. They simply climbed back and forth along the rails.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='758'>In the night-time they walked upon the sleepers, who carpeted the deck, I"ll swear, two deep. Oh! and there were pigs and chickens on deck, and sacks of yams, while every conceivable place was festooned with strings of drinking cocoanuts and bunches of bananas. On both sides, between the fore and main shrouds, guys had been stretched, just low enough for the foreboom to swing clear; and from each of these guys at least fifty bunches of bananas were suspended.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='759'>It promised to be a messy passage, even if we did make it in the two or three days that would have been required if the southeast trades had been blowing fresh. But they weren"t blowing fresh. After the first five hours the trade died away in a dozen or so gasping fans.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='760'>The second day a man died--an Easter Islander, one of the best divers that season in the lagoon. Smallpox--that is what it was; though how smallpox could come on board, when there had been no known cases ashore when we left Rangiroa, is beyond me. There it was, though--smallpox, a man dead, and three others down on their backs.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='761'>There was nothing to be done. We could not segregate the sick, nor could we care for them. We were packed like sardines. There was nothing to do but rot or die--that is, there was nothing to do after the night that followed the first death. On that night, the mate, the supercargo, the Polish Jew, and four native divers sneaked away in the large whale-boat. They were never heard of again. In the morning the captain promptly scuttled the remaining boats, and there we were.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='762'>The German, the two Americans, and myself bought up all the Scotch whiskey, and proceeded to stay drunk. The theory was beautiful--namely, if we kept ourselves soaked in alcohol, every smallpox germ that came into contact with us would immediately be scorched to a cinder. And the theory worked, though I must confess that neither Captain Oudouse nor Ah Choon were attacked by the disease either. The Frenchman did not drink at all, while Ah <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ah;drink' adjectives='restricted' verbs='do;drink' valence='5.735' arousal='4.25166666667' dominance='5.41'>Choon</entity> restricted himself to one drink daily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='763'>It was a pretty time. The sun, going into northern declination, was straight overhead. There was no wind, except for frequent squalls, which blew fiercely for from five minutes to half an hour, and wound up by deluging us with rain. After each squall, the awful sun would come out, drawing clouds of steam from the soaked decks.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='764'>The steam was not nice. It was the vapor of death, freighted with millions and millions of germs. We always took another drink when we saw it going up from the dead and dying, and usually we took two or three more drinks, mixing them exceptionally stiff. Also, we made it a rule to take an additional several each time they hove the dead over to the sharks that swarmed about us.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='765'>We had a week of it, and then the whiskey gave out. It is just as well, or I shouldn"t be alive now. It took a sober man to pull through what followed, as you will see when I mention the little fact that only two men did pull through. The other man was the heathen--at least, that was what I heard Captain Oudouse call him at the moment I first became aware of the heathen"s existence. But to come back.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='766'>It was at the end of the week, with the whiskey gone, and the pearl-buyers sober, that I happened to glance at the barometer that hung in the cabin companionway. Its normal register in the Paumotus was 29.90, and it was quite customary to see it vacillate between 29.85 and 30.00, or even 30.05; but to see it as I saw it, down to 29.62, was sufficient to sober the most drunken pearl-buyer that ever incinerated smallpox microbes in Scotch whiskey.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='767'>I called Captain Oudouse"s attention to it, only to be informed that he had watched it going down for several hours. There was little to do, but that little he did very well, considering the circumstances. He took off the light sails, shortened right down to storm canvas, spread life-lines, and waited for the wind. His mistake lay in what he did after the wind came. He hove to on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='equator;hurricane;rub;thing;tack;path;_' adjectives='right;direct' verbs='be;heave;do' valence='5.61' arousal='3.8125' dominance='5.4725'>the port</entity> tack, which was the right thing to do south of the Equator, if--and there was the rub--_if_ one were _not_ in the direct path of the hurricane.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='768'>We were in the direct path. I could see that by the steady increase of the wind and the equally steady fall of the barometer. I wanted him to turn and run with the wind on the port quarter until the barometer ceased falling, and then to heave to. We argued till he was reduced to hysteria, but budge he would not. The worst of it was that I could not get the rest of the pearl-buyers to back me up. Who was I, anyway, to know more about the sea and its ways than a properly qualified captain? was what was in their minds, I knew.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='769'>Of course the sea rose with the wind frightfully; and I shall never forget the first three seas the _Petite Jeanne_ shipped. She had fallen off, as vessels do at times when hove to, and the first sea made a clean breach. The life-lines were only for the strong and well, and little good were they even for them when the women and children, the bananas and cocoanuts, the pigs and trade boxes, the sick and the dying, were swept along in a solid, screeching, groaning mass.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='770'>The second sea filled the _Petite Jeanne"s_ decks flush with the rails; and, as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward, all the miserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft. It was a human torrent. They came head-first, feet-first, sidewise, rolling over and over, twisting, squirming, writhing, and crumpling up. Now and again one caught a grip on a stanchion or a rope; but the weight of the bodies behind tore such grips loose.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='771'>One man I noticed fetch up, head on and square on, with the starboard-bitt. His head cracked like an egg. I saw what was coming, sprang on top of the cabin, and from there into the mainsail itself. Ah Choon and one of the Americans tried to follow me, but I was one jump ahead of them. The American was swept away and over the stern like a piece of chaff. Ah Choon caught a spoke of the wheel, and swung in behind it. But a strapping Raratonga vahine (woman)--she must have weighed two hundred and fifty--brought up against him, and got an arm around his neck. He clutched the kanaka steersman with his other hand; and just at that moment the schooner flung down to starboard.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='772'>The rush of bodies and sea that was coming along the port runway between the cabin and the rail turned abruptly and poured to starboard. Away they went--vahine, Ah <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='steersman;ah;choon;rail;vahine;resignation;grin' adjectives='philosophic' verbs='go;see;swear;clear' valence='5.30272727273' arousal='4.51181818182' dominance='5.17090909091'>Choon</entity>, and steersman: and I swear I saw Ah Choon grin at me with philosophic resignation as he cleared the rail and went under.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='773'>The third sea--the biggest of the three--did not do so much damage. By the time it arrived nearly everybody was in the rigging. On deck perhaps a dozen gasping, half-drowned, and half-stunned wretches were rolling about or attempting to crawl into safety. They went by the board, as did the wreckage of the two remaining boats. The other pearl-buyers and myself, between seas, managed to get about fifteen women and children into the cabin, and battened down. Little good it did the poor creatures in the end.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='774'>Wind? Out of all my experience I could not have believed it possible for the wind to blow as it did. There is no describing it. How can one describe a nightmare? It was the same way with that wind. It tore the clothes off our bodies. I say _tore them off_, and I mean it. I am not asking you to believe it. I am merely telling something that I saw and felt. There are times when I do not believe it myself. I went through it, and that is enough. One could not face that wind and live. It was a monstrous thing, and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='775'>Imagine countless millions and billions of tons of sand. Imagine this sand tearing along at ninety, a hundred, a hundred and twenty, or any other number of miles per hour. Imagine, further, this sand to be invisible, impalpable, yet to retain all the weight and density of sand. Do all this, and you may get a vague inkling of what that wind was like.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='776'>Perhaps sand is not the right comparison. Consider it mud, invisible, impalpable, but heavy as mud. Nay, it goes beyond that. Consider every molecule of air to be a mud-bank in itself. Then try to imagine the multitudinous impact of mud-banks. No; it is beyond me. Language may be adequate to express the ordinary conditions of life, but it cannot possibly express any of the conditions of so enormous a blast of wind. It would have been better had I stuck by my original intention of not attempting a description.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='777'>I will say this much: The sea, which had risen at first, was beaten down by that wind. More: it seemed as if the whole ocean had been sucked up in the maw of the hurricane, and hurled on through that portion of space which previously had been occupied by the air.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='778'>Of course, our canvas had gone long before. But Captain Oudouse had on the _Petite Jeanne_ something I had never before seen on a South Sea schooner--a sea-anchor. It was a conical canvas bag, the mouth of which was kept open by a huge hoop of iron. The sea-anchor was bridled something like a kite, so that it bit into the water as a kite bites into the air, but with a difference. The sea-anchor remained just under the surface of the ocean in a perpendicular position. A long line, in turn, connected it with the schooner. As a result, the _Petite <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='wind;sea;result;_;bow' adjectives='petite' verbs='be;ride' valence='5.88875' arousal='4.1' dominance='5.36875'>Jeanne</entity>_ rode bow on to the wind and to what sea there was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='779'>The situation really would have been favorable had we not been in the path of the storm. True, the wind itself tore our canvas out of the gaskets, jerked out our topmasts, and made a raffle of our running-gear, but still we would have come through nicely had we not been square in front of the advancing storm-centre. That was what fixed us. I was in a state of stunned, numbed, paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact of the wind, and I think I was just about ready to give up and die when the centre smote us. The blow we received was an absolute lull. There was not a breath of air. The effect on one was sickening.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='780'>Remember that for hours we had been at terrific muscular tension, withstanding the awful pressure of that wind. And then, suddenly, the pressure was removed. I know that I felt as though I was about to expand, to fly apart in all directions. It seemed as if every atom composing my body was repelling every other atom and was on the verge of rushing off irresistibly into space. But that lasted only for a moment. Destruction was upon us.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='781'>In the absence of the wind and pressure the sea rose. It jumped, it leaped, it soared straight toward the clouds. Remember, from every point of the compass that inconceivable wind was blowing in toward the centre of calm. The result was that the seas sprang up from every point of the compass. There was no wind to check them. They popped up like corks released from the bottom of a pail of water. There was no system to them, no stability. They were hollow, maniacal seas. They were eighty feet high at the least. They were not seas at all. They resembled no sea a man had ever seen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='782'>They were splashes, monstrous splashes--that is all. Splashes that were eighty feet high. Eighty! They were more than eighty. They went over our mastheads. They were spouts, explosions. They were drunken. They fell anywhere, anyhow. They jostled one another; they collided. They rushed together and collapsed upon one another, or fell apart like a thousand waterfalls all at once. It was no ocean any man had ever dreamed of, that hurricane centre. It was confusion thrice confounded. It was anarchy. It was a hell-pit of sea-water gone mad.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='783'>The _Petite Jeanne_? I don"t know. The heathen told me afterward that he did not know. She was literally torn apart, ripped wide open, beaten into a pulp, smashed into kindling wood, annihilated. When I came to I was in the water, swimming automatically, though I was about two-thirds drowned. How I got there I had no recollection. I remembered seeing the _Petite Jeanne_ fly to pieces at what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was buffetted out of me. But there I was, with nothing to do but make the best of it, and in that best there was little promise. The wind was blowing again, the sea was much smaller and more regular, and I knew that I had passed through the centre. Fortunately, there were no sharks about. The hurricane had dissipated the ravenous horde that had surrounded the death ship and fed off the dead.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='784'>It was about midday when the _Petite Jeanne_ went to pieces, and it must have been two hours afterward when I picked up with one of her hatch-covers. Thick rain was driving at the time; and it was the merest chance that flung me and the hatch-cover together. A short length of line was trailing from the rope handle; and I knew that I was good for a day, at least, if the sharks did not return. Three hours later, possibly a little longer, sticking close to the cover, and, with closed eyes, concentrating my whole soul upon the task of breathing in enough air to keep me going and at the same time of avoiding breathing in enough water to drown me, it seemed to me that I heard voices. The rain had ceased, and wind and sea were easing marvellously. Not twenty feet away from me on another hatch-cover, were Captain Oudouse and the heathen. They were fighting over the possession of the cover--at least, the Frenchman was.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='785'>"_Paien noir_!" I heard him scream, and at the same time I saw him kick the kanaka.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='786'>Now, Captain Oudouse had lost all his clothes, except his shoes, and they were heavy brogans. It was a cruel blow, for it caught the heathen on the mouth and the point of the chin, half stunning him. I looked for him to retaliate, but he contented himself with swimming about forlornly a safe ten feet away. Whenever a fling of the sea threw him closer, the Frenchman, hanging on with his hands, kicked out at him with both feet. Also, at the moment of delivering each kick, he called the kanaka a black heathen.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='787'>"For two centimes I"d come over there and drown you, you white beast!" I yelled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='788'>The only reason I did not go was that I felt too tired. The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating. So I called to the kanaka to come to me, and proceeded to share the hatch-cover with him. Otoo, he told me his name was (pronounced o-to-o); also, he told me that he was a native of Bora Bora, the most westerly of the Society Group. As I learned afterward, he had got the hatch-cover first, and, after some time, encountering Captain <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='captain;time;pain;hatch-cover' adjectives='' verbs='be;offer;get;share;kick;have;learn;encounter' valence='5.596' arousal='4.158' dominance='5.45333333333'>Oudouse</entity>, had offered to share it with him, and had been kicked off for his pains.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='789'>And that was how Otoo and I first came together. He was no fighter. He was all sweetness and gentleness, a love-creature, though he stood nearly six feet tall and was muscled like a gladiator. He was no fighter, but he was also no coward. He had the heart of a lion; and in the years that followed I have seen him run risks that I would never dream of taking. What I mean is that while he was no fighter, and while he always avoided precipitating a row, he never ran away from trouble when it started. And it was ""Ware shoal!" when once Otoo went into action. I shall never forget what he did to Bill King. It occurred in German Samoa. Bill King was hailed the champion heavyweight of the American Navy. He was a big brute of a man, a veritable gorilla, one of those hard-hitting, rough-housing chaps, and clever with his fists as well. He picked the quarrel, and he kicked Otoo twice and struck him once before Otoo felt it to be necessary to fight. I don"t think it lasted four minutes, at the end of which time Bill King was the unhappy possessor of four broken ribs, a broken forearm, and a dislocated shoulder-blade. Otoo knew nothing of scientific boxing. He was merely a manhandler; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='beach;manhandler;bit;something' adjectives='' verbs='receive;be;recover;manhandle' valence='5.96923076923' arousal='4.06846153846' dominance='5.53461538462'>Bill King</entity> was something like three months in recovering from the bit of manhandling he received that afternoon on <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='beach;manhandler;bit;something' adjectives='' verbs='receive;be;recover;manhandle' valence='5.96923076923' arousal='4.06846153846' dominance='5.53461538462'>Apia</entity> beach.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='790'>But I am running ahead of my yarn. We shared the hatch-cover between us. We took turn and turn about, one lying flat on the cover and resting, while the other, submerged to the neck, merely held on with his hands. For two days and nights, spell and spell, on the cover and in the water, we drifted over the ocean. Toward the last I was delirious most of the time; and there were times, too, when I heard Otoo babbling and raving in his native tongue. Our continuous immersion prevented us from dying of thirst, though the sea-water and the sunshine gave us the prettiest imaginable combination of salt pickle and sunburn.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='791'>In the end, Otoo saved my life; for I came to lying on the beach twenty feet from the water, sheltered from the sun by a couple of cocoanut leaves. No one but Otoo could have dragged me there and stuck up the leaves for shade. He was lying beside me.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='792'>We were the sole survivors of the _Petite Jeanne._ Captain Oudouse must have succumbed to exhaustion, for several days later his hatch-cover drifted ashore without him. Otoo and I lived with the natives of the atoll for a week, when we were rescued by a French cruiser and taken to Tahiti. In the meantime, however, we had performed the ceremony of exchanging names. In the South Seas such a ceremony binds two men closer together than blood-brothership. The initiative had been mine; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='initiative' adjectives='mine' verbs='delight;be;have;suggest' valence='6.17' arousal='4.03142857143' dominance='5.77857142857'>Otoo</entity> was rapturously delighted when I suggested it.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='794'>"But Death stuttered." I smiled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='795'>"It was a brave deed you did, master," he replied, "and Death was not vile enough to speak."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='797'>"Yes, master," he answered, his eyes luminous and soft with joy.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='798'>"There you go!" I cried indignantly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='799'>"What does it matter what my lips utter?" he argued. "They are only my lips. But I shall think Otoo always. Whenever I think of myself, I shall think of you.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='800'>I hid my smile, and answered that it was well.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='801'>We parted at Papeete. I remained ashore to recuperate; and he went on in a cutter to his own island, Bora Bora. Six weeks later he was back. I was surprised, for he had told me of his wife, and said that he was returning to her, and would give over sailing on far voyages.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='802'>"Where do you go, master?" he asked after our first greetings.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='803'>I shrugged my shoulders. It was a hard question.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='805'>"I will go with you," he said simply. "My wife is dead."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='806'>I never had a brother; but from what I have seen of other men"s brothers, I doubt if any man ever had a brother that was to him what Otoo was to me. He was brother and father and mother as well. And this I know: I lived a straighter and better man because of Otoo. I cared little for other men, but I had to live straight in Otoo"s eyes. Because of him I dared not tarnish myself. He made me his ideal, compounding me, I fear, chiefly out of his own love and worship; and there were times when I stood close to the steep pitch of Hades, and would have taken the plunge had not the thought of Otoo restrained me. His pride in me entered into me, until it became one of the major rules in my personal code to do nothing that would diminish that pride of his.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='807'>Naturally, I did not learn right away what his feelings were toward me. He never criticised, never censured; and slowly the exalted place I held in his eyes dawned upon me, and slowly I grew to comprehend the hurt I could inflict upon him by being anything less than my best.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='808'>For seventeen years we were together; for seventeen years he was at my shoulder, watching while I slept, nursing me through fever and wounds--ay, and receiving wounds in fighting for me. He signed on the same ships with me; and together we ranged the Pacific from Hawaii to Sydney Head, and from Torres Straits to the Galapagos. We blackbirded from the New Hebrides and the Line Islands over to the westward clear through the Louisades, New Britain, New Ireland, and New Hanover. We were wrecked three times--in the Gilberts, in the Santa Cruz group, and in the Fijis. And we traded and salved wherever a dollar promised in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='wreck;dollar;beche-de-mer;turtle-shell;pearl;hawkbill;pearl-shell;copra' adjectives='' verbs='promise;strand;salve;trade' valence='5.34888888889' arousal='4.07555555556' dominance='5.35888888889'>the way</entity> of pearl and pearl-shell, copra, beche-de-mer, hawkbill turtle-shell, and stranded wrecks.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='809'>It began in Papeete, immediately after his announcement that he was going with me over all the sea, and the islands in the midst thereof. There was a club in those days in Papeete, where the pearlers, traders, captains, and riffraff of South Sea adventurers foregathered. The play ran high, and the drink ran high; and I am very much afraid that I kept later hours than were becoming or proper. No matter what the hour was when I left the club, there was Otoo waiting to see me safely home.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='810'>At first I smiled; next I chided him. Then I told him flatly that I stood in need of no wet-nursing. After that I did not see him when I came out of the club. Quite by accident, a week or so later, I discovered that he still saw me home, lurking across the street among the shadows of the mango-trees. What could I do? I know what I did do.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='811'>Insensibly I began to keep better hours. On wet and stormy nights, in the thick of the folly and the fun, the thought would persist in coming to me of Otoo keeping his dreary vigil under the dripping mangoes. Truly, he had made a better man of me. Yet he was not strait-laced. And he knew nothing of common Christian morality. All the people on Bora Bora were Christians; but he was a heathen, the only unbeliever on the island, a gross materialist, who believed that when he died he was dead. He believed merely in fair play and square dealing. Petty meanness, in his code, was almost as serious as wanton homicide; and I do believe that he respected a murderer more than a man given to small practices.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='812'>Otoo had my welfare always at heart. He thought ahead for me, weighed my plans, and took a greater interest in them than I did myself. At first, when I was unaware of this interest of his in my affairs, he had to divine my intentions, as, for instance, at Papeete, when I contemplated going partners with a knavish fellow-countryman on a guano venture. I did not know he was a knave. Nor did any white man in Papeete. Neither did Otoo know, but he saw how thick we were getting, and found out for me, and without my asking him. Native sailors from the ends of the seas knock about on the beach in Tahiti; and Otoo, suspicious merely, went among them till he had gathered sufficient data to justify his suspicions. Oh, it was a nice history, that of Randolph Waters. I couldn"t believe it when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='home;waters;steamer;t;murmur' adjectives='' verbs='sheet;couldn;get;give;believe;narrate' valence='6.00461538462' arousal='4.27692307692' dominance='5.56615384615'>Otoo</entity> first narrated it; but when I sheeted it home to Waters he gave in without a murmur, and got away on the first steamer to Aukland.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='813'>At first, I am free to confess, I couldn"t help resenting Otoo"s poking his nose into my business. But I knew that he was wholly unselfish; and soon I had to acknowledge his wisdom and discretion. He had his eyes open always to my main chance, and he was both keen-sighted and far-sighted. In time he became my counsellor, until he knew more of my business than I did myself. He really had my interest at heart more than I did. Mine was the magnificent carelessness of youth, for I preferred romance to dollars, and adventure to a comfortable billet with all night in. So it was well that I had some one to look out for me. I know that if it had not been for Otoo, I should not be here to-day.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='814'>Of numerous instances, let me give one. I had had some experience in blackbirding before I went pearling in the Paumotus. Otoo and I were in Samoa--we really were on the beach and hard aground--when my chance came to go as recruiter on a blackbird brig. Otoo signed on before the mast; and for the next half-dozen years, in as many ships, we knocked about the wildest portions of Melanesia. Otoo saw to it that he always pulled stroke-oar in my boat. Our custom in recruiting labor was to land the recruiter on the beach. The covering boat always lay on its oars several hundred feet off shore, while the recruiter"s boat, also lying on its oars, kept afloat on the edge of the beach. When I landed with my trade-goods, leaving my steering sweep apeak, Otoo left his stroke position and came into the stern-sheets, where a Winchester lay ready to hand under a flap of canvas. The boat"s crew was also armed, the Sniders concealed under canvas flaps that ran the length of the gunwales. While I was busy arguing and persuading the woolly-headed cannibals to come and labor on the Queensland plantations Otoo kept watch. And often and often his low voice warned me of suspicious actions and impending treachery. Sometimes it was the quick shot from his rifle, knocking a savage over, that was the first warning I received. And in my rush to the boat his hand was always there to jerk me flying aboard. Once, I remember, on _Santa Anna_, the boat grounded just as the trouble began. The covering boat was dashing to our assistance, but the several score of savages would have wiped us out before it arrived. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='direction;trade-goods;tobacco;tomahawk;hand;leap;bead;calico;knife' adjectives='' verbs='fly;dig;take;scatter' valence='4.985' arousal='4.36416666667' dominance='4.96833333333'>Otoo</entity> took a flying leap ashore, dug both hands into the trade-goods, and scattered tobacco, beads, tomahawks, knives, and calicoes in all directions.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='815'>This was too much for the woolly-heads. While they scrambled for the treasures, the boat was shoved clear, and we were aboard and forty feet away. And I got thirty recruits off that very beach in the next four hours.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='816'>The particular instance I have in mind was on Malaita, the most savage island in the easterly Solomons. The natives had been remarkably friendly; and how were we to know that the whole village had been taking up a collection for over two years with which to buy a white man"s head? The beggars are all head-hunters, and they especially esteem a white man"s head. The fellow who captured the head would receive the whole collection. As I say, they appeared very friendly; and on this day I was fully a hundred yards down the beach from the boat. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='grief' adjectives='usual' verbs='come;do;caution;heed;have' valence='4.778' arousal='4.235' dominance='5.266'>Otoo</entity> had cautioned me; and, as usual when I did not heed him, I came to grief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='817'>The first I knew, a cloud of spears sailed out of the mangrove swamp at me. At least a dozen were sticking into me. I started to run, but tripped over one that was fast in my calf, and went down. The woolly-heads made a run for me, each with a long-handled, fantail tomahawk with which to hack off my head. They were so eager for the prize that they got in one another"s way. In the confusion, I avoided several hacks by throwing myself right and left on the sand.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='818'>Then Otoo arrived--Otoo the manhandler. In some way he had got hold of a heavy war club, and at close quarters it was a far more efficient weapon than a rifle. He was right in the thick of them, so that they could not spear him, while their tomahawks seemed worse than useless. He was fighting for me, and he was in a true Berserker rage. The way he handled that club was amazing. Their skulls squashed like overripe oranges. It was not until he had driven them back, picked me up in his arms, and started to run, that he received his first wounds. He arrived in the boat with four spear thrusts, got his Winchester, and with it got a man for every shot. Then we pulled aboard the schooner and doctored up.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='819'>Seventeen years we were together. He made me. I should to-day be a supercargo, a recruiter, or a memory, if it had not been for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='820'>"You spend your money, and you go out and get more," he said one day. "It is easy to get money now. But when you get old, your money will be spent, and you will not be able to go out and get more. I know, master. I have studied the way of white men. On the beaches are many old men who were young once, and who could get money just like you. Now they are old, and they have nothing, and they wait about for the young men like you to come ashore and buy drinks for them.</paragraph>

The captain has a double awning, and drinks beer out of long bottles. I have never seen him haul a rope or pull an oar. He gets one hundred and fifty dollars a month. I am a sailor.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='822'>Otoo spurred me on to it. He sailed with me as second mate on my first schooner, and he was far prouder of my command than I was myself. Later on it was:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='824'>"True, but a schooner costs five thousand dollars--an old schooner at that," I objected. "I should be an old man before I saved five thousand dollars."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='827'>"Between this river mouth and the next it is two miles," he said. "The flat land runs far back. It is worth nothing now. Next year--who knows?--or the year after, men will pay much money for that land. The anchorage is good. Big steamers can lie close up. You can buy the land four miles deep from the old chief for ten thousand sticks of tobacco, ten bottles of square-face, and a Snider, which will cost you, maybe, one hundred dollars. Then you place the deed with the commissioner; and the next year, or the year after, you sell and become the owner of a ship."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='828'>We did not go seafaring so much as in the old days. I was too well off. I married, and my standard of living rose; but Otoo remained the same old-time Otoo, moving about the house or trailing through the office, his wooden pipe in his mouth, a shilling undershirt on his back, and a four-shilling lava-lava about his loins. I could not get him to spend money. There was no way of repaying him except with love, and God knows he got that in full measure from all of us. The children worshipped him; and if he had been spoilable, my wife would surely have been his undoing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='829'>The children! He really was the one who showed them the way of their feet in the world practical. He began by teaching them to walk. He sat up with them when they were sick. One by one, when they were scarcely toddlers, he took them down to the lagoon, and made them into amphibians. He taught them more than I ever knew of the habits of fish and the ways of catching them. In the bush it was the same thing. At seven, Tom knew more woodcraft than I ever dreamed existed. At six, Mary went over the Sliding Rock without a quiver, and I have seen strong men balk at that feat. And when <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fathom;shilling;bottom' adjectives='' verbs='turn;have;bring' valence='5.18125' arousal='3.68875' dominance='5.17625'>Frank</entity> had just turned six he could bring up shillings from the bottom in three fathoms.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='831'>I say one of _our_ schooners, though legally at the time they belonged to me. I struggled long with him to enter into partnership.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='832'>"We have been partners from the day the _Petite Jeanne_ went down," he said at last. "But if your heart so wishes, then shall we become partners by the law.

I do not pay for the playing of billiards, for I play on your table; but still the money goes. Fishing on the reef is only a rich man"s pleasure. It is shocking, the cost of hooks and cotton line. Yes; it is necessary that we be partners by the law. I need the money. I shall get it from the head clerk in the office."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='833'>So the papers were made out and recorded. A year later I was compelled to complain.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='834'>"Charley," said I, "you are a wicked old fraud, a miserly skinflint, a miserable land-crab.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='835'>"Is there any owing me?" he asked anxiously.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='836'>"I tell you thousands and thousands," I answered.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='837'>His face brightened, as with an immense relief.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='838'>"It is well," he said. "See that the head clerk keeps good account of it. When I want it, I shall want it, and there must not be a cent missing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='839'>"If there is," he added fiercely, after a pause, "it must come out of the clerk"s wages."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='840'>And all the time, as I afterward learned, his will, drawn up by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='beneficiary;consul;s;time' adjectives='safe;sole' verbs='draw;lay;make;learn' valence='5.72307692308' arousal='3.98923076923' dominance='5.95230769231'>Carruthers</entity>, and making me sole beneficiary, lay in the American consul"s safe.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='841'>But the end came, as the end must come to all human associations. It occurred in the Solomons, where our wildest work had been done in the wild young days, and where we were once more--principally on a holiday, incidentally to look after our holdings on Florida Island and to look over the pearling possibilities of the Mboli Pass. We were lying at <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='curio' adjectives='' verbs='be;trade;run;have;lie' valence='5.35' arousal='4.29' dominance='5.528'>Savo</entity>, having run in to trade for curios.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='842'>Now, Savo is alive with sharks. The custom of the woolly-heads of burying their dead in the sea did not tend to discourage the sharks from making the adjacent waters a hang-out. It was my luck to be coming aboard in a tiny, overloaded, native canoe, when the thing capsized. There were four woolly-heads and myself in it, or, rather, hanging to it. The schooner was a hundred yards away. I was just hailing for a boat when one of the woolly-heads began to scream. Holding on to the end of the canoe, both he and that portion of the canoe were dragged under several times. Then he loosed his clutch and disappeared. A shark had got him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='843'>The three remaining savages tried to climb out of the water upon the bottom of the canoe. I yelled and struck at the nearest with my fist, but it was no use. They were in a blind funk. The canoe could barely have supported one of them. Under the three it upended and rolled sidewise, throwing them back into the water.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='844'>I abandoned the canoe and started to swim toward the schooner, expecting to be picked up by the boat before I got there. One of the savages elected to come with me, and we swam along silently, side by side, now and again putting our faces into the water and peering about for sharks. The screams of the man who stayed by the canoe informed us that he was taken. I was peering into the water when I saw a big shark pass directly beneath me. He was fully sixteen feet in length. I saw the whole thing. He got the woolly-head by the middle, and away he went, the poor devil, head, shoulders, and arms out of water all the time, screeching in a heartrending way. He was carried along in this fashion for several hundred feet, when he was dragged beneath the surface.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='845'>I swam doggedly on, hoping that that was the last unattached shark. But there was another. Whether it was the one that had attacked the natives earlier, or whether it was one that had made a good meal elsewhere, I do not know. At any rate, he was not in such haste as the others. I could not swim so rapidly now, for a large part of my effort was devoted to keeping track of him. I was watching him when he made his first attack. By good luck I got both hands on his nose, and, though his momentum nearly shoved me under, I managed to keep him off. He veered clear, and began circling about again. A second time I escaped him by the same maneuver. The third rush was a miss on both sides. He sheered at the moment my hands should have landed on his nose, but his sandpaper hide (I had on a sleeveless undershirt) scraped the skin off one arm from elbow to shoulder.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='846'>By this time I was played out, and gave up hope. The schooner was still two hundred feet away. My face was in the water, and I was watching him maneuver for another attempt, when I saw a brown body pass between us. It was Otoo.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='847'>"Swim for the schooner, master!" he said. And he spoke gayly, as though the affair was a mere lark. "I know sharks. The shark is my brother."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='848'>I obeyed, swimming slowly on, while <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='shark' adjectives='encouraging' verbs='swim;foil;obey;rush;keep' valence='5.4075' arousal='4.87166666667' dominance='5.50083333333'>Otoo</entity> swam about me, keeping always between me and the shark, foiling his rushes and encouraging me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='849'>"The davit tackle carried away, and they are rigging the falls," he explained, a minute or so later, and then went under to head off another attack.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='850'>By the time the schooner was thirty feet away I was about done for. I could scarcely move. They were heaving lines at us from on board, but they continually fell short. The shark, finding that it was receiving no hurt, had become bolder. Several times it nearly got me, but each time Otoo was there just the moment before it was too late. Of course, Otoo could have saved himself any time. But he stuck by me.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='851'>"Good-bye, Charley! I"m finished!" I just managed to gasp.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='852'>I knew that the end had come, and that the next moment I should throw up my hands and go down.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='857'>I changed my course and struck out blindly. I was by that time barely conscious. As my hand closed on the line I heard an exclamation from on board.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='858'>"Otoo!" he called softly. And I could see in his gaze the love that thrilled in his voice.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='867'>But the man was undisturbed. His head had slipped from the folded newspaper, and the straggling, unkempt hair was matted with the foxtails and burrs of the dry grass on which it lay. He was not a pretty sight. His mouth was open, disclosing a gap in the upper row where several teeth at some time had been knocked out. He breathed stertorously, at times grunting and moaning with the pain of his sleep. Also, he was very restless, tossing his arms about, making jerky, half-convulsive movements, and at times rolling his head from side to side in the burrs. This restlessness seemed occasioned partly by some internal discomfort, and partly by the sun that streamed down on his face and by the flies that buzzed and lighted and crawled upon the nose and cheeks and eyelids. There was no other place for them to crawl, for the rest of the face was covered with matted beard, slightly grizzled, but greatly dirt-stained and weather-discolored.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='868'>The cheek-bones were blotched with the blood congested by the debauch that was evidently being slept off. This, too, accounted for the persistence with which the flies clustered around the mouth, lured by the alcohol-laden exhalations. He was a powerfully built man, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, with sinewy wrists and toil-distorted hands. Yet the distortion was not due to recent toil, nor were the callouses other than ancient that showed under the dirt of the one palm upturned. From time to time this hand clenched tightly and spasmodically into a fist, large, heavy-boned and wicked-looking.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='869'>The man lay in the dry grass of a tiny glade that ran down to the tree-fringed bank of the stream. On either side of the glade was a fence, of the old stake-and-rider type, though little of it was to be seen, so thickly was it overgrown by wild blackberry bushes, scrubby oaks and young madrono trees. In the rear, a gate through a low paling fence led to a snug, squat bungalow, built in the California Spanish style and seeming to have been compounded directly from the landscape of which it was so justly a part. Neat and trim and modestly sweet was the bungalow, redolent of comfort and repose, telling with quiet certitude of some one that knew, and that had sought and found.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='870'>Through the gate and into the glade came as dainty a little maiden as ever stepped out of an illustration made especially to show how dainty little maidens may be. Eight years she might have been, and, possibly, a trifle more, or less. Her little waist and little black-stockinged calves showed how delicately fragile she was; but the fragility was of mould only. There was no hint of anemia in the clear, healthy complexion nor in the quick, tripping step. She was a little, delicious blond, with hair spun of gossamer gold and wide blue eyes that were but slightly veiled by the long lashes. Her expression was of sweetness and happiness; it belonged by right to any face that sheltered in the bungalow.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='871'>She carried a child"s parasol, which she was careful not to tear against the scrubby branches and bramble bushes as she sought for wild poppies along the edge of the fence. They were late poppies, a third generation, which had been unable to resist the call of the warm October sun.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='872'>Having gathered along one fence, she turned to cross to the opposite fence. Midway in the glade she came upon the tramp. Her startle was merely a startle. There was no fear in it. She stood and looked long and curiously at the forbidding spectacle, and was about to turn back when the sleeper moved restlessly and rolled his hand among the burrs. She noted the sun on his face, and the buzzing flies; her face grew solicitous, and for a moment she debated with herself. Then she tiptoed to his side, interposed the parasol between him and the sun, and brushed away the flies. After a time, for greater ease, she sat down beside him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='873'>An hour passed, during which she occasionally shifted the parasol from one tired hand to the other. At first the sleeper had been restless, but, shielded from the flies and the sun, his breathing became gentler and his movements ceased. Several times, however, he really frightened her. The first was the worst, coming abruptly and without warning. "Christ! How deep! How deep!" the man murmured from some profound of dream. The parasol was agitated; but the little girl controlled herself and continued her self-appointed ministrations.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='874'>Another time it was a gritting of teeth, as of some intolerable agony. So terribly did the teeth crunch and grind together that it seemed they must crush into fragments. A little later he suddenly stiffened out. The hands clenched and the face set with the savage resolution of the dream. The eyelids trembled from the shock of the fantasy, seemed about to open, but did not. Instead, the lips muttered:</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='875'>"No; no! And once more no. I won"t peach." The lips paused, then went on. "You might as well tie me up, warden, and cut me to pieces. That"s all you can get outa me--blood. That"s all any of you-uns has ever got outa me in this hole."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='876'>After this outburst the man slept gently on, while the little girl still held the parasol aloft and looked down with a great wonder at the frowsy, unkempt creature, trying to reconcile it with the little part of life that she knew. To her ears came the cries of men, the stamp of hoofs on the bridge, and the creak and groan of wagons heavy laden. It was a breathless California Indian summer day. Light fleeces of cloud drifted in the azure sky, but to the west heavy cloud banks threatened with rain. A bee droned lazily by. From farther thickets came the calls of quail, and from the fields the songs of meadow larks.

This was severe under any circumstances, but with him it had been especially severe, because there had been no prior convictions against him.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='878'>Young Ross Shanklin had toiled terribly in jail; he had escaped, more than once; and he had been caught and sent back to toil in other and various jails. He had been triced up and lashed till he fainted had been revived and lashed again. He had been in the dungeon ninety days at a time. He had experienced the torment of the straightjacket. He knew what the humming bird was. He had been farmed out as a chattel by the state to the contractors. He had been trailed through swamps by bloodhounds. Twice he had been shot. For six years on end he had cut a cord and a half of wood each day in a convict lumber camp. Sick or well, he had cut that cord and a half or paid for it under a whip-lash knotted and pickled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='879'>And Ross Shanklin had not sweetened under the treatment. He had sneered, and raved, and defied. He had seen convicts, after the guards had manhandled them, crippled in body for life, or left to maunder in mind to the end of their days. He had seen convicts, even his own cell mate, goaded to murder by their keepers, go to the gallows reviling God. He had been in a break in which eleven of his kind were shot down. He had been through a mutiny, where, in the prison yard, with gatling guns trained upon them, three hundred convicts had been disciplined with pick handles wielded by brawny guards.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='880'>He had known every infamy of human cruelty, and through it all he had never been broken. He had resented and fought to the last, until, embittered and bestial, the day came when he was discharged. Five dollars were given him in payment for the years of his labor and the flower of his manhood. And he had worked little in the years that followed. Work he hated and despised. He tramped, begged and stole, lied or threatened as the case might warrant, and drank to besottedness whenever he got the chance.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='881'>The little girl was looking at him when he awoke. Like a wild animal, all of him was awake the instant he opened his eyes. The first he saw was the parasol, strangely obtruded between him and the sky. He did not start nor move, though his whole body seemed slightly to tense. His eyes followed down the parasol handle to the tight-clutched little fingers, and along the arm to the child"s face. Straight and unblinking he looked into her eyes, and she, returning the look, was chilled and frightened by his glittering eyes, cold and harsh, withal bloodshot, and with no hint in them of the warm humanness she had been accustomed to see and feel in human eyes. They were the true prison eyes--the eyes of a man who had learned to talk little, who had forgotten almost how to talk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='882'>"Hello," he said finally, making no effort to change his position. "What game are you up to!"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='883'>His voice was gruff and husky, and at first it had been harsh; but it had softened queerly in a feeble attempt at forgotten kindliness.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='884'>"How do you do?" she said. "I"m not playing. The sun was on your face, and mamma says one oughtn"t to sleep in the sun."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='885'>The sweet clearness of her child"s voice was pleasant to him, and he wondered why he had never noticed it in children"s voices before. He sat up slowly and stared at her. He felt that he ought to say something, but speech with him was a reluctant thing.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='886'>"I hope you slept well," she said gravely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='887'>"I sure did," he answered, never taking his eyes from her, amazed at the fairness and delicacy of her. "How long was you holdin" that contraption up over me?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='888'>"O-oh," she debated with herself, "a long, long time. I thought you would never wake up."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='889'>"And I thought you was a fairy when I first seen you."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='890'>He felt elated at his contribution to the conversation.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='891'>"No, not a fairy," she smiled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='892'>He thrilled in a strange, numb way at the immaculate whiteness of her small even teeth.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='893'>"I was just the good Samaritan," she added.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='894'>"I reckon I never heard of that party."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='895'>He was cudgelling his brains to keep the conversation going. Never having been at close quarters with a child since he was man-grown, he found it difficult.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='896'>"What a funny man not to know about the good Samaritan. Don"t you remember?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='899'>"What spot?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='900'>"Why, where he fell among thieves and was left half dead. And then the good Samaritan went to him, and bound up his wounds, and poured in oil and wine--was that olive oil, do you think?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='901'>He shook his head slowly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='902'>"I reckon you got me there. Olive oil is something the dagoes cooks with. I never heard of it for busted heads."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='903'>She considered his statement for a moment.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='904'>"Well," she announced, "we use olive oil in _our_ cooking, so we must be dagoes. I never knew what they were before. I thought it was slang."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='905'>"And the Samaritan dumped oil on his head," the tramp muttered reminiscently. "Seems to me I recollect a sky pilot sayin" something about that old gent. D"ye know, I"ve been looking for him off "n on all my life, and never scared up hide nor hair of him. They ain"t no more Samaritans."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='906'>"Wasn"t I one!" she asked quickly.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='907'>He looked at her steadily, with a great curiosity and wonder. Her ear, by a movement exposed to the sun, was transparent. It seemed he could almost see through it. He was amazed at the delicacy of her coloring, at the blue of her eyes, at the dazzle of the sun-touched golden hair. And he was astounded by her fragility. It came to him that she was easily broken. His eye went quickly from his huge, gnarled paw to her tiny hand in which it seemed to him he could almost see the blood circulate. He knew the power in his muscles, and he knew the tricks and turns by which men use their bodies to ill-treat men. In fact, he knew little else, and his mind for the time ran in its customary channel. It was his way of measuring the beautiful strangeness of her. He calculated a grip, and not a strong one, that could grind her little fingers to pulp. He thought of fist blows he had given to men"s heads, and received on his own head, and felt that the least of them could shatter hers like an egg-shell. He scanned her little shoulders and slim waist, and knew in all certitude that with his two hands he could rend her to pieces.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='908'>"Wasn"t I one?" she insisted again.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='909'>He came back to himself with a shock--or away from himself, as the case happened. He was loath that the conversation should cease.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='910'>"What?" he answered. "Oh, yes; you bet you was a Samaritan, even if you didn"t have no olive oil." He remembered what his mind had been dwelling on, and asked, "But ain"t you afraid?"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='911'>"Of ... of me?" he added lamely.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='912'>She laughed merrily.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='913'>"Mamma says never to be afraid of anything. She says that if you"re good, and you think good of other people, they"ll be good, too."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='914'>"And you was thinkin" good of me when you kept the sun off," he marveled.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='915'>"But it"s hard to think good of bees and nasty crawly things," she confessed.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='916'>"But there"s men that is nasty and crawly things," he argued.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='917'>"Mamma says no. She says there"s good in everyone.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='919'>"But she doesn"t. Mamma isn"t afraid of anything. That"s why she lets me play out here alone when I want. Why, we had a robber once. Mamma got right up and found him. And what do you think! He was only a poor hungry man. And she got him plenty to eat from the pantry, and afterward she got him work to do."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='920'>Ross Shanklin was stunned. The vista shown him of human nature was unthinkable. It had been his lot to live in a world of suspicion and hatred, of evil-believing and evil-doing. It had been his experience, slouching along village streets at nightfall, to see little children, screaming with fear, run from him to their mothers. He had even seen grown women shrink aside from him as he passed along the sidewalk.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='921'>He was aroused by <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='hand' adjectives='' verbs='be;arouse;cry;clap' valence='5.74166666667' arousal='5.09' dominance='5.16333333333'>the girl</entity> clapping her hands as she cried out:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='923'>He felt a grim desire to laugh, but repressed it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='924'>"And that"s what tramps are--open air cranks," she continued. "I often wondered. Mamma believes in the open air. I sleep on the porch at night. So does she. This is our land. You must have climbed the fence. Mamma lets me when I put on my climbers--they"re bloomers, you know. But you ought to be told something. A person doesn"t know when they snore because they"re asleep. But you do worse than that. You grit your teeth. That"s bad. Whenever you are going to sleep you must think to yourself, "I won"t grit my teeth, I won"t grit my teeth," over and over, just like that, and by and by you"ll get out of the habit.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='925'>"All bad things are habits. And so are all good things. And it depends on us what kind our habits are going to be. I used to pucker my eyebrows--wrinkle them all up, but mamma said I must overcome that habit. She said that when my eyebrows were wrinkled it was an advertisement that my brain was wrinkled inside, and that it wasn"t good to have wrinkles in the brain. And then she smoothed my eyebrows with her hand and said I must always think _smooth_--_smooth_ inside, and _smooth_ outside. And do you know, it was easy. I haven"t wrinkled my brows for ever so long. I"ve heard about filling teeth by thinking. But I don"t believe that. Neither does mamma."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='926'>She paused rather out of breath. Nor did he speak. Her flow of talk had been too much for him. Also, sleeping drunkenly, with open mouth, had made him very thirsty. But, rather than lose one precious moment, he endured the torment of his scorching throat and mouth.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='956'>He looked at her, numb and hungry with the stir of the father-love, sorry for his ill temper, puzzling his brain for something to say.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1003'>He strolled to the corner and glanced up and down the intersecting street, but saw nothing save the oases of light shed by the street lamps at the successive crossings. Then he strolled back the way he had come. He was a shadow of a man sliding noiselessly and without undue movement through the semi darkness. Also he was very alert, like a wild animal in the jungle, keenly perceptive and receptive. The movement of another in the darkness about him would need to have been more shadowy than he to have escaped him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1004'>In addition to the running advertisement of the state of affairs carried to him by his senses, he had a subtler perception, a _feel_, of the atmosphere around him. He knew that the house in front of which he paused for a moment, contained children. Yet by no willed effort of perception did he have this knowledge. For that matter, he was not even aware that he knew, so occult was the impression. Yet, did a moment arise in which action, in relation to that house, were imperative, he would have acted on the assumption that it contained children.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1005'>In the same way, he knew not how, he knew that no danger threatened in the footfalls that came up the cross street. Before he saw the walker, he knew him for a belated pedestrian hurrying home. The walker came into view at the crossing and disappeared on up the street. The man that watched, noted a light that flared up in the window of a house on the corner, and as it died down he knew it for an expiring match. This was conscious identification of familiar phenomena, and through his mind flitted the thought, "Wanted to know what time." In another house one room was lighted. The light burned dimly and steadily, and he had the feel that it was a sick room.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1006'>He was especially interested in a house across the street in the middle of the block. To this house he paid most attention. No matter what way he looked, nor what way he walked, his looks and his steps always returned to it. Except for an open window above the porch, there was nothing unusual about the house. Nothing came in nor out. Nothing happened. There were no lighted windows, nor had lights appeared and disappeared in any of the windows. Yet it was the central point of his consideration. He rallied to it each time after a divination of the state of <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='state;divination;time' adjectives='' verbs='rally' valence='5.426' arousal='4.22' dominance='5.516'>the neighborhood</entity>.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1007'>Despite his feel of things, he was not confident. He was supremely conscious of the precariousness of his situation.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1008'>Far down the street he caught a glimpse of something that moved. And he knew it was no late home-goer, but menace and danger. He whistled twice to the house across the street, then faded away shadow-like to the corner and around the corner. Here he paused and looked about him carefully. Reassured, he peered back around the corner and studied the object that moved and that was coming nearer. He had divined aright. It was a policeman.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1168'>Again the unseen thing of gloom had fluttered, and his being was vibrant with premonition of impending misfortune. He felt a disruptive influence at work in the flesh of him, and in all his muscles there was a seeming that they were about to begin to twitch. He sat back suddenly, and as suddenly leaned forward with his elbows on the table. A tremor ran dimly through the muscles of his body. It was like the first rustling of leaves before the oncoming of wind. He clenched his teeth. It came again, a spasmodic tensing of his muscles. He knew panic at the revolt within his being. His muscles no longer recognized his mastery over them. Again they spasmodically tensed, despite the will of him, for he had willed that they should not tense. This was revolution within himself, this was anarchy; and the terror of impotence rushed up in him as his flesh gripped and seemed to seize him in a clutch, chills running up and down his back and sweat starting on his brow. He glanced about the room, and all the details of it smote him with a strange sense of familiarity. It was as though he had just returned from a long journey. He looked across the table at his partner. Matt was watching him and smiling. An expression of horror spread over <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='horror;spread;expression;s' adjectives='' verbs='face' valence='5.24333333333' arousal='4.86666666667' dominance='5.45'>Jim</entity>"s face.</paragraph>

His muscles tensed and twitched and knotted, hurting him and crushing him in their savage grip. And in the midst of it all, it came to him that Matt was acting queerly. He was traveling the same road. The smile had gone from his face, and there was on it an intense expression, as if he were listening to some inner tale of himself and trying to divine the message. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='walk;sit;get' valence='5.798' arousal='3.158' dominance='5.694'>Matt</entity> got up and walked across <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='' adjectives='' verbs='walk;sit;get' valence='5.798' arousal='3.158' dominance='5.694'>the room</entity> and back again, then sat down.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1181'>He thrust Jim back into the middle of the room and shot the bolts into place. As he went across the floor to the food shelf, he passed one hand over his brow and flung off the beaded sweat. It spattered audibly on the floor. Jim watched agonizedly as Matt got the mustard can and a cup and ran for the sink. He stirred a cupful of mustard and water and drank it down. Jim had followed him and was reaching with trembling hands for the empty cup. Again Matt shoved him away. As he mixed a second cupful, he demanded:</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1188'>And Jim supported his twitching body by holding on to the sink, the while he yearned toward the yellowish concoction that stood for life.

Matt drank the third cupful, and with difficulty managed to get to a chair and sit down. His first paroxysm was passing. The spasms that afflicted him were dying away. This good effect he ascribed to the mustard and water. He was safe, at any rate. He wiped the sweat from his face, and, in the interval of calm, found room for curiosity. He looked at his partner.</paragraph>

And in the midst of the paroxysm, with his body and all the parts of it flying apart and writhing and twisting back again into knots, he clung to the chair and shoved it before him across the floor.

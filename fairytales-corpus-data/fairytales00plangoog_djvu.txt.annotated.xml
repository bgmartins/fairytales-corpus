	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>This assertion may appear startling to those who are  familiar with many English versions of the most popular  of them ; but it is, nevertheless, a fact, as the examina-  tion of this little volume will prove.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>Early in the last century, three volumes of Fairy  Tales were published, under the title of " A Collection  of Novels and Tales of the Fairies, written by that cele-  brated wit of France, the Countess d"Anois, translated  from the best edition of the original French, by several  hands." And in 1817 the same collection reappeared in  two small volumes, with a new preface, and entitled,  " Fairy Tales, translated from the French of the Coun-  tess d"Anois." Now, it will scarcely be believed that,  although the collectors introduced the novels which link  the second series of her Fairy Tales together, after the  fashion of the old Italian novelists, they not only omitted  the whole of the first series, but also several of the b  of the second ; substituting, in the place o? \\ve. \^.^</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>Nor was the injustice to the author limited to this  singular caprice. The tales, instead of being faithfully  translated, were recklessly abridged and loosely para-  phrased ; while the incidental couplets occasionally, and  the versified morals invariably, were dispensed with  altogether.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>Other abridgments and paraphrases of a few of these  stories have appeared in sundry juvenile publications ;  and, in a very recent one, the rising generation was pre-  sented with " Babiole,"^ " Princess Rosette,^^ " Princess  Printaniere^" (called "Princess Maia"), " The Beneficent  Frog," and " The Good Little Mouse ;" but still abridged,  and adapted to the atmosphere of the nursery. I beg to  disclaim any intention of depreciating these latter pro-  ductions, which are avowedly addressed to the youngest  class of readers ; but the first was a literary fraud, which  cannot be too severely denounced, whether it be regarded  as an imposition on the public or an injustice to the  original author. And yet the writer of the Preface to the  fifth edition (<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='edition;writer;preface' adjectives='' verbs='say;pretend' valence='5.56428571429' arousal='4.09714285714' dominance='5.56142857143'>London</entity>, 1766) says, " I shall not pretend</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='75'>Had not the many liberties I have taken with the  Fairy Tales of Madame d"Aulnoy, in adapting them to  the stage, made it a point of conscience with me to  adhere as rigidly as possible to the original text on this  occasion, I should have been stimulated to it by another  circumstance, which evidently had a precisely contraij  effect on my predecessors. The numberless allusions to  the persons, events, works, manners, and customs of the  age in which they were written, were doubtlessly con-  sidered incumbrances by those whose only object wb  to provide amusement for the Nursery ; and I do not  dispute the discretion with which they might have been  altered or omitted in abridgments made for that special  purpose ; but such a plea cannot be put in for the  translators of " the best edition of the original French,^"  who professed to give the general English Public the  works of a " celebrated wit of France," whose " thoughts  are so elegant and refined, their beauties would be lost  in a paraphrase.^^</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'>The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, says the author  of " A Discourse on the Origin of Fairy Tales," had frozen  every pen. No one dared to write anything for fear of dis-  pleasing the king, who had appointed royal censors of the  press as substitutes for the Doctors of the Sorbonne, who had  themselves superseded the Inquisitors of the Holy Office. But  this congelation was merely temporary. Since Madame de  Maintenon had arisen from the rank of governess to the chil-  dren of Madame de Montespan to that of the wife, though  not the queen, of Louis XIV., the Court had adopted a tone  which had been properly assumed by a pious woman sur-  rounded by legitimate princes still young, and to whom good  examples were indispensable. Age, public misfortunes, and  the character of his connexion with Madame de Maintenon,  had brought Louis himself back to the steps of the altar and  the calm of private society. Amongst the tutors selected  for the princes of the blood were Bossuet and Fenelon. The  talent of these justly celebrated men popularized the purest  morals, by covering them with flowera, and dressing them in  the most pleasing forms. Books for the instruction of princes  were eagerly multiplied, a select library was printed of them ;  it seemed as if the whole nation had determined to purify its  gallantry in the crucible of a wise yet infantile morality. At  this period there lived a number of women who cultivated  letters successfully; others, who esteemed them, vjto\.q ^xiOc</paragraph>

To quote the words of one of the most  popular writers of the present day, " It woidd be hard to  estimate the amount of gentleness and mercy that lias made  its way among us through these slight channels.

In merit and person I eagerly admit your supe-  riority. I have loved you long ; I have been often near you  in these gardens without your perceiving me. The Fairy  power bestowed upon me at my birth has been of great ser-  vice in procuring me the pleasure of beholding you. I will  accompany you everywhere to-day in this habit, and, I trust,  not altogether without being of service to you." The princess  gazed at him while he spoke, in a state of astonishment from  which she could not recover. " It is you, then, handsome  Percinet !" said she to him. " It is you whom I have so much  wished to see, and of whom such surprising things are related !  How delighted I am that you desire to be my firiend !

A few more words passed between them, and  then Gracieuse repaired to the palace, where she found a horse  ready saddled and caparisoned, which Percinet had placed in  the stables, and which it was supposed must be intended for  her.

Is this creature to have a finer horse than It  I had rather never be a queen and return to my precious  castle, than be treated in this manner ! ** The king immediately  commanded the princess to dismoimt, and to b^ Grognon  would do her honour to ride her horse. The princess obeyed  without a murmur. Grognon neither looked at her, nor thanked  her. She was hoisted up on the beautiful horse, and looked  like a bundle of dirty clothes. Eight gentlemen held her for  fear she should fall otf. Still she was not satisfied, but mut-  tered threats between her teeth. They inquired what was the  matter with her. " The matter is," said she, " that^ being  the mistress, I choose that the green page shall hold the rein  of my horse as he did when Gracieuse rode it." The king  ordered the green page to lead the queen"s horse. Percinet  looked at the princess, and she at him, without speaking a  word.

She was dragged  for some distance over stones and thorns into a heap of mud  where she was almost smothered. As everybody had ran  after her as fast as they could, they soon came up to her:  but her skin was scratched all over, her head cut open in four  or five places, and one of her arms broken.

" Percinet !" she cried, twice or thrice,  **Percinet! Where are you? Is it possible you can have  abandoned me?" As she uttered the last words, she suddenly  beheld the most surprising thing in the world. It was an  illumination so magnificent that there was not a tree in the  forest on which there were not several chandeliers filled with  wax lights, and at the far end of an avenue she perceived  a palace built entirely of crystal, which blazed like the son.  She began to imagine Percinet had some hand in this new  enchantment, and felt her joy a little mingled with fear. "I  am alone," she said, " the prince is young, amiable, in love^  and I owe him my life ! Ah ! It is too much !  Let me fly  from him !  Better for me to die than love him !" So saying;  she managed to rise from the ground, notwithstanding hex  weariness and weakness, and without casting another look  towards the splendid palace, she hurried off in an opposite  direction, so distressed and so bewildered by the various feel-  ings which agitated her, that she did not know what she was  doing.</paragraph>

It was  throughout as light as day. There were shepherds and shep-  herdesses gallantly dressed who danced to the sound of flutes  and bag-pipes. In other spots, by the side of fountains," she  saw village swains and maidens feasting and singing gaily.  " I thought this forest was uninhabited," said she to the  prince; "but it seems full of happy people." "From the  moment you set foot in it," replied Percinet, " this gloomy  solitude became the abode of pleasure and mirth. The loves  accompany you and flowers grow beneath your feet." Gracieuse  feared to enter into such a conversation : she therefore re-  quested him to conduct her to his mother, the queen. \He &gt;y^  immediately ordered the stags to proceed to the feiry palace.  As she approached it she heard most exquisite music, and  the queen with two of her daughters met her, embraced her,  and led her into a large saloon, the walls of which were of  rock-crystal. She observed, with great astonishment, that all  her own history to that very day was engraved upon the walls,  even the promenade she had just made with the prince in the  sledge, and the execution of the work was so fine that the  master-pieces of Phidias and all that Greece ever could boast  were not to be compared to it. "You have very diligent artists,"  said Gracieuse to Percinet, " every action, every gesture of  mine is instantly sculptured." " Because I would not lose  the recollection of the slightest circumstance relating to you,  my princess," replied he. "Alas, in no place am I happy or  contented!" She made him no answer; but thanked the  queen for the manner in which she had received her. A grand  banquet was served up, to which Gracieuse did justice, for she  was delighted to have found Percinet in lieu of the bears and  lions she had dreaded to meet in the forest. Although she  was very tired, the prince persuaded her to pass into a saloon  dazzling with gold and painting, in which an opera was per-  formed before her. The subject was the Loves of Cupid and  Psyche, and it was interspersed with dances and allusive  songs. A young shepherd came forward, and sang the fol-  lowing words :</paragraph>

She was waited on by four-and-twenty miaidemi  attired as nymphs, the eldest was but eighteen, and each a  miracle of beauty.

Gracieuse told him she had not been able  to sleep ; that the recollection of her misfortunes tormented  her, and that she could not help dreading the consequences.  " What can alarm you, madam ?" said he ; " you are sovereign  here  you are here adored  ^would you abandon me for your  cruel enemy?" *"If I were my own mistress,** she replied, "I  would accept your proposal; but I am accountable to the  king, my &amp;ther, for my actions, and it is better to suffer than  fiedl in my duty." Percinet said everything in the world he  could think of to persuade her to marry him ; but she would  not consent, and it was almost in spite of herself that she was  induced to remain one week, during which he invented a  thousand new pleasures for her entertainment. She often  said to the prince, ""I should much like to know what is  passing in Grognon"s Court, and how she has glossed over her  conduct to me r V PcJ^cinet told her he would send his squire  to ascertain, who was an intelligent person. She replied that  she was convinced he had no need of any one to inform him  of what was going on, and that therefore he could tell her  immediately if he chose. " Come then with me," said he,  " into the great tower, and you shall see for yourself." There-  upon he led her to the top of an exceedingly high tower which  was all of rock-crystal, like the rest of the chateau. He told  her to place her foot on his, and her little finger in his mouth,  and then to look in the direction of the city. She imme-  diately perceived that the wicked Grognon was with the king,  and that she was saying to him, " That wretched princess has  hanged herself in the cellar ; I have just seen her, she is a  most horrible sight  she must be buried immediately, and  you will soon get over so trifling a loss." The king began to  weep for the death of his daughter. Grognon turned her  back upon him, retired to her apartments, caused a log of wood  to be dressed up in a cap, and well wrapped in grave-clothes,  put into a coffin, and then by order of the king there was a  grand funeral, which was attended by everybody, weeping and  cursing the cruel stepmother, whom they accused of having  caused the death of the princess.

It was of no use  talking; she would go. She took leave of the prince"s  mother and sisters, entered the sledge with him, and the  stags started off. As she left the palace she heard a great  noise.

I want to pimish her, by giving her such difficult tasks  to execute that she will not be able to perform them, and so  that I may break her bones without giving her a right to  complain. Help me to find a new torment for her every day."  The Fairy told her she would think of it, and that she should  see her again the next morning. She kept her word. She  brought a skein of thread as big as four grown-up people, so  finely spun that it would break if you breathed on it, and so  tangled that it was in a bundle without beginning or end.  Grognon, delighted, sent for her beautiful prisoner, and said  to her  " There, my good little gossip, set your great powers  at work to wind off this skin of thread ; and rest assured that  if you break the least bit of it, you are lost, for I will flay you  alive, myself !

I am not capable  of deserting you, notwithstanding the poor return you make  to my affection." He struck the skein three times with his  wand; the broken threads were immediately rejoined, and  two more taps unravelled it with most astonishing perfection.  He inquired if there was any other service he could render  her, and whether she would never call on him but when she  was in trouble. " Do not reproach me, handsome Percinet,"  said she ; " I am already sufficiently miserable." " But, my  Princess, it is in your own power to Uberate yourself from the  tyramiy of which you are the victim. Come with me. Com-  plete our mutual happiness.

""Find out something," she said, "so difficult  that she cannot possibly accomplish it." The Fairy departed,  and the next day returned with a great barrel full of feathers.  There were some of all sorts of birds  nightingales, canaries,  greenfinches, goldfinches, linnets, redwings, parrots, owls, spar-  rows, doves, ostriches, bustards, peacocks, larks, partridges;   I should never have finished if I attempted to name them all.  These feathers were so mixed together, that the birds them-  selves could not have recognised their own. " Here," Siiid the  Fairy to Grognon, " is what will try the skill and patience of  your prisoner. Order her to pick out these feathers, and put  the peacock"s, the nightingale"s, and every other sort, each by  themselves in separate heaps. It would be a task for a fairy."  Grognon was r^dy to die with joy, picturing to herself the  perplexity of the wretched princess.

She saw him appear instantly in his  splendid green dress. " If it were not for the wicked Grog-  non," said he, " beautiful princess, you would never think of  me."* " Oh, think better of my sentiments," she replied; " I  am not so insensible to merit, nor so ungrateful for benefits  conferred on me. It is true I try your constancy ; but it is to  reward it when I am convinced." Percinet, more happy than  he had ever been before, tapped the box thrice with his wand,  and immediately the little men and women, fiddlers, cooks,  and roast-meat, were all packed into it as neatly as if they  had never been out of it. Percinet had left his chariot in the  wood. He begged the princess to make use of it to go to  the rich ch&amp;teau.

The prince in his turn knelt at her feet ; and at the same  instant the palace rang with shouts and music, and the mar-  riage was celebrated with the greatest magnificence.

These mischief-makers went  immediately to the king, and said, " Sire, you know not what  Avenant asserts,  That if you had sent him to the Fair with  Grolden Hair he would have brought her back with him.

He has not a sub-  ject more loyal than I am,  I have never done anything to  offend him !"* The king by chance passed dose by the tower,  and hearing the voice of one he had loved so dearly, he stopped  to listen, notwithstanding those who were with him, who hatod  Avenant, and said to the king, " What interests you, Sirel   Do you not know he is a rogue?" The king replied^ " Leave me  alone ; I would hear what he has to say." Having listened to  his complaints, the tears stood in his eyes: he opened the  door of the tower and called to the prisoner. Avenant came^  and knelt before him in deep sorrow, and kissed his feet  " What have I done. Sire, that I am thus severely treated!"  " Thou hast made game of me, and of my ambassador,** an-  swered the king.

Sire," rejoined Avenant, " that I should have  so impressed her with the sense of your majesty"s high qua-  lities, that I feel persuaded she could not have refused you;  and in saying that, Sire, I uttered nothing that could be dis-  agreeable to you," The king saw clearly that Avenant was  innocent. He cast an angry look upon the traducers of his  favourite, and brought him away with him, sincerely repent-  ing the wrong he had done to him. After giving him an  excellent supper he called him into his cabinet and said to  him : " Avenant, I still love the Fair with Golden Hair ; her  refusal has not discouraged me : but I know not what course  to take to induce her to marry me. I am tempted to send  thee to her to see if thou couldst succeed." Avenant re-  plied that he was ready to obey him in everything, and that  he would set out the next day. " Hold," said the king; "I  would give thee a splendid equipage." ** It is unnecessary,"  answered Avenant ; " I need only a good horse, and letters of  credence from your majesty." <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='' adjectives='delighted' verbs='be;embrace;find;prepare;start' valence='6.44285714286' arousal='4.45428571429' dominance='6.11857142857'>The king</entity> embraced him, for  he was delighted to find him prepared to start so quickly.</paragraph>

He had a writing-case in his pockety and when a  happy idea occurred to him for his introductory address, he  alighted from his steed and seated himself under the trees to  commit it to paper, so that he might not forget anything.  One morning ^at he had set out at the first peep of day, in  passing through a large meadow, a charming idea came into  his head: he dismounted, and seated himself beside some  willows and poplars which were planted along the bank of a  little river that ran by the edge of the meadow. After he  had made his note, he looked about him, delighted to find  himself in so beautiful a spot. He perceived on the grass  a large gilded carp gasping and nearly exhausted, for in try-  ing to catch some little flies it had leaped so far out of the  water that it had fallen on the grass, and was all but dead.  Avenant took pity upon it, and, although it was a fast-day,  and he might have carried it off for his dinner, he picked it  up and put it gently back into the river. As soon as my  friend the carp felt the freshness of the water, she began to  recover herself, and glided down to the very bottom, then  rising again joyously to the bank of the stream, " Avenant,"  said she, " I thank you for the kindness you have done me ;  but for you I should have died. You have saved me ; I will  do as much for you." After this little compliment she darted  down again into the water, leaving Avenant much surprised  at her intelligence and great civility.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='346'>Another day, as he continued his journey, he saw a crow in  great distress. The poor bird was pursued by a large eagle  (a great devourer of crows), which had nearly caught it, and  would have swallowed it like a lentil if Avenant had not felt  compassion for its misfortune. " Thus," he cried, " do the  strong oppress the weak. What right has the eagle to eat the  crow ? " He seized his bow and arrow, which he always carried  with him, and taking a good aim at the eagle, whizz ! he sent  the shaft right through its body; it fell dead, and the crow,  enraptured, came and perched on a tree. " Avenant," it cried  to him, " it was very generous of you thus to succour me,  I who am only a poor crow ; but I will not be ungrateful,  I will do as much for you."</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='359'>Avenant was ushered into the hall of audience. He was so  struck with admiration, that he has since declared frequently  that he could scarcely speak ; nevertheless, he took courage,  and delivered his oration to perfection. He beseeched the  princess that he might not have the mortification of returning  without her. "Gentle Avenant," she replied, **the argu-  ments you have adduced are all of them exceedingly good,  and I assure you I should be very happy to favour yon more  than another, but you must know that about a month ago I  was walking by the river side, with all my ladies in waiting,  and in pulUng off my glove in order to take some refreshment  that was served me I drew from my finger a ring, which un-  fortunately fell into the stream. I valued it more than my  kingdom. I leave you to imagine the grief its loss occasioned  me. I have made a vow never to listen to any offers of mar-  riage, if the ambassador, who proposes the husband, does not  restore to me my ring.

When he returned to his lodgings, he went  to bed without eating any supper, and his little dog, whose  name was Cabriolle, would take none himself, and went and  laid down beside his master. All night long Avenant never  ceased sighing. " Where can I hope to find a ring that fell a  month ago into a great river]" said he; "it would be folly to  attempt looking for it. The princess only named this condi-  tion to me because she knew it was impossible for me to fulfil  it."* And then he sighed again and was very sorrowfuL  Cabriolle, who heard him, said, " My dear master, I entreat  you not to despair of your good fortune : you are too amiable  not to be happy.

Avenant!"  He looked all around him, and could see nobody : he thought  he was dreaming. He resumed his walk, when again the  voice called, "Avenant! Avenant!" "Who calls meV he  asked. Cabriolle, who was very little and was looking close  down into the water, replied, " Never trust me if it be not a  golden carp that I see here." Immediately the carp appeared  on the surface, and said to Avenant, " You saved my life in  the nettle-tree meadow,^ where I must have perished but for  your assistance. I promised to do as much for you. Here,  dear Avenant, is the ring of the Fair with Golden Hair.

Avenant was intro-  duced, and presented her with the ring, saying, " Madam, I  have obeyed your commands. Will it please you to accept  the king my master for your husband?" When she saw her  ring quite perfect she was so astonished  so astonished  that  she thought she was dreaming ! *" Really," said she, "* cour-  teous Avenant, you must be favoured by a fairy, for by  natural means this is impossible." " Madam," he answered,  ** I am not acquainted with any fairy, but I was very anxious  to obey you." "As you are so obliging," continued she, " you  must do me another service, without which I never will be  married. There is a prince not far from here, named Gali-  fron, who has taken it into his head he will make me his  wife. He declared to me his determination, accompanying it  by the most terrible threats, that if I refused him he would  lay waste my kingdom ; but judge if I could accept him. He  is a giant taller than a high tower; he eats a man as a  monkey eats a chestnut ; when he goes into the country he  carries in his pockets small cannons which he uses for pistols,  and when he speaks very loud those who are near him become  deaf I sent word to him that I did not wish to marry, and  that he must excuse me, but he has never ceased to persecute  me.

" Madam," said  Avenant to the princess, " your enemy is dead : I trust you  wiU no longer refuse the king my master." " Ah ! pardon  me,"* said the Fair with Golden Hair; "but, indeed, I must  refuse him, unless you can find means, before my departure,  to bring me some water from the Gloomy Grotto. Hard by  there is a deep cavern, full six leagues in extent. At the  mouth of it are two dragons, who prevent any one from  entering : flames issue from their jaws and eyes. Inside the  cavern is a deep pit, into which you must descend : it is full  of toads, adders, and serpenta At the bottom of this pit  there is a small cavity, through which flows the fountain of  Health and Beauty. Some of that water I must absolutely  obtain. Whatever is washed with it becomes something mar-  vellous. If persons are handsome, they remain so for ever ;  if ugly, they become beautiful : if young, they remain always  young; if old, they become young again. You may well  imagine, Avenant, that I would not quit my kingdom without  some of this wonderful water." " Madam," he replied, " you  are so beautiful already, that this water will be quite useless  to you; but I am an unfortunate ambassador, whose death  you desire. I go in search of that which you covet, with the  certainty that I shall never return." The Fair with Golden  Hair was immovable, and Avenant set out with the little dog  Cabriolle to seek in the Gloomy Grotto the water of beauty.  Everybody who met him on the road exclaimed, " "Tis a pity  to see so amiable a youth wantonly court destruction. He  goes alone to the grotto, when, even if he had a hundred men  to back him he could not accomplish his object. Why will  the princess only demand impossibilities ? " Avenant passed  on without saying a word, but he was in very low spirits.</paragraph>

He knew that the Gloomy Grotto was not  far from that spot, and looked about to see if he could dis-  cover it. He perceived a horrible rock, as black as ink, out  of which issued a thick smoke ; and the next minute one of  the dragons, casting out fire from his mouth and eyes. lt\ia.^</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='570'>On the other hand, the Fairy Soussio sent Truitonne back  to the queen, who was anxiously waiting to know how the  nuptials had gone off. When she saw her daughter, and  heard from her lips all that had happened, she put herself in  a terrible passion, which recoiled upon the poor Florine.  ^She shall repent more than once," said the queen, ""her  fiiscination of Charmant!" She ascended the tower, with  Truitonne, whom she had dressed in her richest clothes, with  a crown of diamonds on her head, a royal mantle, the train  of which was borne by three daughters of the richest barons  in the realm, and on her thumb King Charmant"s ring, which  Elorine had noticed the day they conversed together. Florine  was greatly surprised to see Truitonne in such pompous  appareL "* My daughter has come to bring you a wedding  present," said the queen. ^ King Charmant has espoused her;  he loves her to distraction; never has there been such a  happy couple." Thereupon they displayed to the princess  heaps of gold and silver tissues, jewels, lace, and ribbons, con-  tained in large baskets of gold filigree work. In presenting  these objects, Truitonne took care Florine should see King  Charmant"s brilliant ring, so that not being able to doubt her  misfortune, she told them, with an air of desperation, to take  from her sight such &amp;tal gifts, that she would wear nothing  but black, and, indeed, that she should soon be dead. So  saying, she fronted, and the cruel queen, delighted to have  succeeded so well, would not permit any one to assist her;  but left her alone in the most wretched state imaginable, and  went and maliciously reported to the king that his daughter  was so madly in love, that nothing could equal the extrava-  gancies she committed, and that great care shoidd be taken  to prevent her quitting the tower. J"he king told her to  manage ^e matter exactly as she pleased, and that he should  be perfectly satisfied.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='573'>When the princess recovered from her swoon, and began to  reflect on the conduct they had pursued towards her^, on the  ill-treatment of her wicked stepmother, and the utter extino-  tion of her hope one day to become the wife of King  Charmant, her anguish became so keen that she wept the  whole night long. In this wretched condition she sat at an  open window uttering the most tender and touching lamentft-  tions. When day began to break she shut the window, but  continued to weep. The following night she again opened  the window, sobbing and sighing profoundly, and shedding a  torrent of tears. Morning dawned, and she hid herself in the  recesses of her chamber. In the meanwhile King Charmant, or,  to speak more correctly, the beautiful Blue Bird, never ceased  flying round the palace. He believed his dear princess was  confined in it, and if her lamentations were distressing, hia  were no less so. He approaohed the windows as near as he  could in order to look into the apartments; but the dread of  being perceived and recognised by Truitonne prevented his  doing exactly as he wished. " It would cost me my life,"  said he to himself " Should these wicked princesses discover  where I am they would be revenged upon me ; I must keep  aloof, or be exposed to the utmost peril." For these reasons  he took the greatest precautions, and rarely sang except  during the night. There happened to be an excessively lo&amp;y  cypress immediately in front of the window at which Florine  usually sat. The Blue Bird perched upon it, and had scarcely  done so when he heard some one complaining. " How mudi  longer shall I suffer?" said the mourner; "will not death  kindly come to my aid ? Those who fear him see him too  soon  I long for his coming, and he cruelly flies me.  Oh,  barbarous queen ! what have I done to thee that thou shouldst  detain me in this horrible captivity? Hast thou not ways  enough to torment me? Thou hast only to make me witness  of the happiness tby unworthy daughter enjoys in the society  of King Charmantl" The Blue Bird had not lost one  syllable of this complaint. He was so surprised that he  awaited daylight with the greatest impatience in order to  behold the aficted lady, but before the morning dawned she  had closed her window and retired. The Bird, whose curiosity  "&gt; Vened, &amp;iled not to return the following night.

The Blue Bird listened  attentively, and the more he did so, the more convinced he  became Ihat it was his amiable princess who was thus  bewailing. ""Adorable Florine," he cried, "wonder of our  days, why do you desire so speedily to terminate your own?  Your misfortunes are not without remedy!" "Ah! who  speaks to me," cried she, " in such consoling language?" " An  unfortunate king," replied the Bird, "who loves you, and wDl  never love any other than you."

"No, my Princess," replied the Bird; "the lover  who addresses you is incapable of betraying you,"  and as he  uttered these words he flew to the window. Florine was at  first much alarmed at the appearance of so extraordinary a  bird, who spoke with as much sense as if he had been a man,  and yet in the small sweet voice of a nightingale. The  beauly of his plumage, however, and the words he uttered,  soon reassured her. "^ Am I then permitted once more to  behold you, my Princess!" he exclaimed. "Can I taste of  such perfect happiness and not die with joy!

They observed, that, if she were  protected by some fairy or enchanter, any frirther persecution  of her would only irritate her powerful friend, and that it  would be better, first, to endeavour to discover the mystery.  The queen approved of this idea. She sent a young girl, who  affected extreme simplicity, to sleep in Florine"s apartment,  under the pretence that she was placed there to wait upon  her. But it was not likely Florine would Mi into so evident  a tnC^. The princess looked on her, of course, as a spy, and  it was impossible for her to feel more poignant affliction.  "" What, then ! shall I never be able to converse again with  the Bird that is so dear to me !" said she. " He assisted me  to support my misfortunes. I consoled him under his. Our  affection was everything to us ! What will become of him 1  What will become of me." Thinking of all these things, she  shed rivers of tears. She tio longer dared go to the little  window, though she heard the Bird fluttering around it. She  was dying to open it; but she feared exposing the life of her  dear lover. She passed a whole month, without appearing at  the casement The Blue Bird was in despair.

The principal puppet-show was that of Brioche, who is  said to have been the inventor of " Les Marionettes." He is mentioned by Boileau  in his Seventh Epistle : " Non loin de la place oii Brioch6 preside," which was in  Uie Rue Mazarine. It is of him Leander, in the next story (Prince Sprite) buys the  monkeys {vide p. 91). The name of Jieance does not occur in the earliest list of  dancers I have seen, or amongst those mentioned by the Marquis de Dangeau in his  Diaiy ; I am therefore in doubt whether Madame d"Aulnoy alludes to a celebrated  ballet-dancer or an equally popular puppet. The saraband was a dance introduced  into Spain by the Moors. The- jig, from the Teutonic gieg, a fiddle, though of ng^  Jtih invention, was adopted in most European nations.</paragraph>

He ru^ed into the queen s  chamber in this state, and vowed he would kill himself before  her eyes, if she did not instantly find some means of destroy-  ing Leander. The queen, who hated the poor youth, because  he was handsomer than her monkey of a son, replied that  she had long looked upon Leander as a traitor, that she would  willingly put him to death with her own hand. She advised  Furibon to go out hupting with the most trustworthy of his  confidants, ^t Leander would join the chase, and that then  they might teach him how to make himself loved by everj--  body. Furibon accordingly went out hunting. When  Leander heard the hounds and horns in the wood, he mounted  his horse and rode to see who the himters were. He was  much surprised at meeting suddenly the prince. He dis-  mounted and saluted him respectfully. Furibon received  him more graciously than he could have hoped, and bade him  follow in his suite. At the same time, turning to the asstis-  sins, he made signs to them to make sure of their blow. Ho  then galloped away, when suddenly a lion of an enormous  size rushed out of a cavern, and springing upon him puUcil  him to the ground. His attendants fled in every direction,  leaving Leander alone to combat the furious animal. Sword  in hand, he advanced at the hazard of being torn to pieces,  and by his courage and skill rescued his most cruel enemy.</paragraph>

Think  how I can be useful to you, and depend upon my friendship."  The young prince, who had never before held any com-  munication with furies, was so astonished, that it was some  time before he could speak. But at length, making her a  profound bow,  " Madam,"* said he, " after the honour I have  enjoyed of being of service to you, it appears to me I have  notlung more to desire of Fortune.*" " I shall be very sorry,"  replied |he, ""if you do not put me in the way of rendering  you some service. Consider that I have the power to make  you a great king, to prolong your life, to make you still more  amiable, to give you mines full of diamonds and houses full  of gold. I can make you an excellent orator, poet, musician  and painter, the idol of the women; render your nature more  ethereal, make you a spirit of air, water and earth.**  Leander  interrupted her at this point. " Permit me, Madam, to ask  you,** said he, " what advantage should I derive from becom-  ing a spirit? " "" It would enable you to do a thousand useful  and agreeable things,*" replied the fairy. " You are invisible  whenever you please, you traverse in au instant the vast  expanse of the imiverse, you rise in the air without wings, you  dascend to the centre of the earth without dying, you plunge  into the depths of the ocean without being drowned, you  enter everywhere, though the windows and doors are fastened  ever so carefully, and, at any moment you please, you re-ap-  pear in your natural form."* " Ah, Madam ! ** exclaimed  Leander, ^ 1 will be a spirit I am about to travel; I can  imagine an infinite number of pleasures to be enjoyed under  such circumstances, and I prefer that gift to all the others  which you have so generously offered me." "Be a spirit,  then," replied Gentille, passing her hand three times over his  eyes and face. "^ Be a beloved spirit, an amiable spirit, and  a frolicksome spirit." She then embraced him, and gave him  a little red hat ornamented with two parrot"s feathers. " When  jrou put on this cap," continued she, " you wiU be invisible ;  when you take it off you appear again.** Leander, enraptured^</paragraph>

Lieander entered the grand hall of the palace with his little  red cap on his head, and was of course inyifdble. As soon as  he caught sight of Furibon listening, he took a nail and a  hammer and nailed his ear to the door-post. Furibon, dis-  tracted, raved and thumped at the door like a madman,  uttering piercing shrieks. The queen, at the sound of his  voice, ran to open the door to him, and in so doing pulled off  her son"s ear.

The queen called out she  was being murdered, massacred. The king stared, the attend-  ants rushed in, no one was to be seen, and it was whispered  about that her majesty was out of her wits, and that it must  be from grief at seeing Furibon"s ear torn off. The king  believed the rumour, and avoided the queen when she ap-  proached him. The scene was altogether very amusing. The  merry Sprite gave Furibon another good switching, and then,  quitting the apartment, he went into the garden and became  visible. There he boldly gathered the cherries, apricots, and  strawberries, and the rarest flowers in the queen"s parterre,   those she took special care of herself, and which it was death  to touch. The gardener, thunderstruck, ran to tell their ma-  jesties that Prince Leander was stripping the fruit-trees and  plundering the flower-garden. " What insolence ! " exclaimed  the queen. " My little Furibon, my dear poppet !  forget, for  a moment, the pain of your ear, and run after that wretch ;  take with you our guards, our musqueteers, our police, our  courtiers.

He had not made up his mind  whither he would go. He mounted his beautiful horse called  Gnsdelin, and allowed him to take whatever road he pleased.  He passed throu^ woods and plains, over hills and valleys,  without number, resting occasionally, and eating and sleeping,  without meeting with anythiDg worthy of notice. At length  he came to a forest, in which he stopped and dismounted, for  the sake of a little shade, the day being very hot The next  moment he heard some one sighing and sobbing : he looked  all about him, and saw a man, now running, now stopping,  now uttering cries of despair, then silent, tearing his hair, and  striking himself violent blows. There was no doubt he must  be some miserable madman. The prince, touched with com-  passion, accosted him. " I see you," said he, ^" in so pitiable a  condition, that I cannot help inquiring the cause, and offering  you any assistance in my power." " Oh, my lord," answered  the young man, "there is no remedy for my misfortunes.  This very day my beloved is to be sacrificed to a jealous old  wretch, who is very wealthy, but who will make her the most  miserable person in the world." " She loves you, then ? " said  Leander. " I may flatter myself she does," replied he. " And  where is she?" continued the prince. "In a castle at the  further end of this forest," answered the lover. ** Well," said  Leander, " wait here for me ; I will shortly bring you some  good news." So saying, he put on the little red hat, and  wished himself in the castle. He had scarcely arrived, when  he heard a strain of sweet music ; and on entering the build-  ing, it echoed with the sound of violins and other instru-  ments. He walked into a grand hall, filled with the relations  and friends of the old man and the young lady. Nothing  could be more lovely than the latter; but the paleness of  her cheeks, the melancholy imprinted on her coimtenance,  and the tears which occasionally filled her eyes, sufi&amp;ciently  expressed her grief. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='corner;spirit;person' adjectives='invisible' verbs='watch;become;place;be' valence='5.674' arousal='3.982' dominance='5.629'>Leander</entity>, become an invisible spirit,  placed himself in a corner, to watch the persons who were</paragraph>

He saw the &amp;ther and mother of this beautiful girl,  who in whispers scolded her for the disinclination she mani-  fested, and then returned to their places. The Sprite glided  behind the mother, and said in her ear,  "^ As thou dost con-  Btrain thy child to give her hand to this old baboon, assure  thyself that within a week thou shalt be punished by death."  The woman, terrified at hearing a voice and seeing no one,  Eind still more so by the threat it uttered, gave a loud shriek,  BUid fell on the floor. Her husband asked what was the  Knatter with her. She explained that she should be a dead  woman if her daughter"s marriage took place, and that she  would not consent to the match for all the treasures in the  world. The husband was inclined to laugh at her, and treat  her as a dreamer; but the Sprite approached him, and said,  ^"Incredulous old mau, if thou dost not believe thy wife, it  will cost thee thy lifa. Break ofif this match, and give thy  daughter immediately to him she loves.^ These words pro-  duced an astonishing effect The intended bridegroom was  Etbruptly bowed out, on the excuse that they broke off the  match solely in obedience to commands from heaven. He  doubted, and attempted some chicanery, for he was a Nor-  Enandy man;^ but the Sprite shouted such a terrible " Aha !"  In his ear, that it almost deafened him; and, to settle the  tnatter, trod on his gouty feet hard enough to crush them.  So they ran to seek out the lover in the wood. The Sprite  awaited his coming with great impatience,  ^his young mis-  tress alone could feel more. The lovers were ready to die with  joy. The banquet which had been prepared for the old man"s  nuptials, served for those of this happy pair; and the Spiite,  Tesuming his visible form, appeared suddenly at the hall-  door, like a stranger who had been attracted by the sounds of  festivity. As soon as the bridegroom perceived him, he ran  and flung himself at his feet, calling him by every name his  gratitude could suggest. Leander passed two days in their  castle, and might have remained there if he had chosen, for  they offered him all they were worth in the world. He left  such good company with much regret.</paragraph>

Without waiting for her answer, he  departed, leaving his splendid carriage and horses to his  equerries and gentlemen. He paid the rest of his people  handsomely, and mounted his &amp;ithful Grisdelin, determined  never to love again after the trick that had been played him.  Leander rode away at fuU speed. He was for a long time  a prey to griei^ but reason and absence gradually worked a  cure. He arrived at another city, where he learned that  a great ceremony was about to take place that very day, on  the occasion of a yoimg maiden being admitted into the order  of Vestals, although contrary to her own inclinations. The  prince pitied her. It seemed as if his little red hat was given  him expressly to repair public injuries and console the afflicted.  He ran to the temple. The young creature was crowned  with flowers, dressed in white, with her hair flowing on her  shoulders; two of her brothers led her by the hand, and her  mother followed her, with a large company of both sexes.  The eldest Vestal was in waiting at the gates of the temple.  At this moment the Sprite shouted, "Stop! stop! Wicked  brothers! Eeckless parent! Stop! Heaven is opposed to  this unjust ceremony. If you venture to proceed you shall  be crushed like frogs."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='906'>They stared about them without being able to discover  whence proceeded these terrible threats.

I The stick was seen to rise and fall on their shoulders like a  bammer upon an anviL Nobody could doubt that the blows  were reaL Terror seized the Vestals, they fled, and everybody  followed their example.

If you think I am right, I will venture to give you a little  advice. Let us bum the picture immediately."

Leander wanted no other inducement to  range the universe. He .pushed his little red hat almost  over his eyes, and wished himself in China. He bought the  richest stuff he could find there, and took copies of all the  dresses. From thence he flew to Siam, where he did the  same thing. In brief, he visited the four quarters of the  world in three days; and as fast as he could load himself he  returned to the Palace of Peaceful Pleasures, to hide what he  had purchased in one of the apartments. When he had  thus collected an infinite number of curiosities, (for money  was nothing to him; his rose famished him with it in-  cessantly,) he went and bought five or six dozen dolls,  which he had dressed in Paris; the place of all the world  in which fashion has most temples.

The nurse, who told the Princess all the news, informed  her of this, and assured her that nothing in the world could  be a finer sight than the entry of Fanfarinet. " Ah ! how  unfortunate am I!" exclaimed the Princess. ""They coop  me up here in a dark tower, as if I had committed some great  crime.

The king and queen  say that they will take me out of this place when I am twenty ;  but they only say so to make me patient, and I am certain  they will let me &lt;fie here, without my having done anything to  offend them.** Thereupon she began to cry so much  so much   that her eyes swelled as big as one"s fist; and the wet-nurse,  and the foster-sister, and the cradle-rocker, and the dresser,  and the nursery-maid, who all loved her passionately, began  also to cry so much  so much  that nothing was to be heard  but sobs and sighs.

Decide amongst  yourselves, whether you had rather I should cut my throat  on the spot, than that you should procure me this gratifi-  cation!** At these words the nurse and all the others recom-  menced crying still more bitterly, and resolved unanimously  that they would enable her to see Fanfarinet, or die them-  selves in the attempt. They passed the rest of the night in  proposing various schemes, without finding any that were  feasible, and Printaniere, who was almost out of her wits,  continually exclaimed, " Never again try to make me believe  that you love me 1  ^you would find plenty of ways if you did.

The queen  having Bumptuously entertained the Fairies who had oome to  see her, said to them, when they were preparing to depart,  " Do not forget your jjoud custom, but tell me what will  happen to Bosette" (the name they had given to the little  princeBs). The Fairies replied that they had left their con-  juring books at home, and that they would come and tell her  another time, "Ah," said the queen, "tliat bodea me no  good; you do not wish to af&amp;ict mo by predicting aome hug-  fortune : but I entreat you to let me know all hide nothing  from me." Thoy made every sort of excuae, and only  increased the queen"s deaire for information. At last the  principal Fairy said to her, " We fear, Madam, that Rosette  will be the cause of some great misfortune to her brothers;  that some affair of hers will cost thent their lives. That is  all tliat we can foresee respecting this beautifal little girl, and  we are very sorry we cannot tell you anything more agree-  able."

He rarely  suflFered himself to be seen, and put his subjects to death  on the slightest suspicion. They called him King Brun,^  because he was always frowning. King Brun had a son  who was not in the least like him. Nothing could equal his  intelligence, his sweet temper, his liberality, and his general  capacity; but he had crooked legs, a hunch on his back which  Was higher than his head, squinting eyes, a wry mouth, in  short, he was a little monster, and never had so beautiful  a soul animated so deformed a body. Nevertheless, by a sin-  gular fate, he was doted upon by everybody whom he wished  to please. He was so superior in mind to all around him,  that it was impossible to listen to him with indifference.  The queen, his mother, chose that he should be called  Torticoli, either because she liked that name, or that the  prince being actually all of a twist, she considered that she  had hit upon the one most appropriate for him. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='daughter;son;neighbour;dominion;greatness;eye;happiness' adjectives='powerful;sovereign;more' verbs='cast;join;think' valence='6.25692307692' arousal='4.48923076923' dominance='5.69538461538'>King Brun</entity>, who thought more of the greatness than the happiness  of his son, cast his eyes upon the daughter of a powerful  sovereign, his near neighbour, and whose dominions joined to</paragraph>

In my Extravaganza, founded on this story, I took the  liberty of designating his majesty, King Brown ; but though the translation  as literal, it did not so completely convey the idea of the author as the other  sense in which the word " brun" is used, namely, that of dark, gloomy, dusky, &amp;c.  We say, in English, a man " looks black" when he frowns,  not brown. *" A brown  study." implies deep thought, but not melancholy or anger.

He accepted the proposals of King  Brun, and though, to apeak the truth, he had not been greatly  atruck by the portrait of Prince Torticoli, which had been  brought to him, he had it, in its turn, placed in a magnificent  gsllery. Trognon was brought thither to see it. As soon as  she had looked on it, she cast down her eyes, and b^an to  weep. Her &amp;ther, incensed at the repugnance she evinced,  took a looking-glass, and placing it before her, said, *" You  weep, my daughter I Ah ! look at yourself, and then admit  that you have no right to complain." " If I were in any  hurry to be married, my liege," said she, "* it woidd, perhaps,  be wrong in me to be so fastidious; but I can bear my  shame whilst I am alone. I desire no one to share with me  the misery of beholding me. Let me remain the unfortunate  Princess Trognon all my life, and I shall be contented  at  least I will not complain." However excellent her reasons,  the king would not listen to them. She was compelled to  depart with the ambassadors who had been sent to propose  for her. Whilst she is travelling in a litter, in which she  was stuck like a stump, we must return to the tower, and  see what the Prince is about. None of his guards dared  to speak to him. They had been ordered to let him grow  melancholy, to give him bad food, and vex him with all  kinds of ill-usage. King Brun knew how to make himself  obeyed. If they did not do it for love, they did it from fear ;  but the affection they bore to the <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='fear;love;suffering;affection' adjectives='' verbs='do;alleviate;induce;bear' valence='5.707' arousal='4.442' dominance='5.244'>Prince</entity> induced them to  alleviate his sufferings as much as they could.</paragraph>

At these words  ^ Prinoe was seised with sueh a yiolent panic, (for he had  teen trombling for some time,) that he let the book drop on  epp side, and fell on the other like a dead man.

His guardians, mudii afflicted, gave him something good  to eat^ in spite of the King"s prohibition. When he had  eaten, he took up the book again before them, and no longer  fcfond anything he had seen in it. This convinced him that  he had been under a delusion.</paragraph>

It had a dress exactly like  his own; It ascended into the keep of the tower, and dis-  ooveced the golden ramrod. As the Prinoe had eaten a good  "breakfEust, he could no longer imagine this was the work of  fimcy. ^ This is too mysterious," said he, "^ for me to neglect  tiie means of knowing more.

He consulted the  windows; he saw that the wainscot lifted up. He immediately  raised it, and found himself in a vestibule all of porphyry,  ornamented with statues.

Oh, how frightened the Princess was !  ^how she regretted at  that moment her shepherd, her sheep, and her dog! She  thought only of flight ; and, without saying a word to this  terrible man, she ran to the door : but it was covered with  spiders* webs.

"I have resolved never to love," said  she. "Oh, how silly thou. art 1" continued the Magician.

Thou shalt be  green, because thou art still in thy greenest youth; thou  shalt be agile and sprightly ; thou shalt live in the fields, as  thou hast done ; and they shall call thee Grasshopper." At  the same moment Princess BriUiante became the most beau-  tiful grasshopper in the world, and availing herself of her  liberty, skipped quickly into the garden. As soon as she  was able to reflect on her situation, she exclaimed mournfully,  "Oh, my bowl! my dear bowl! what has become of you?   Behold the result of your promises, Trasimene ! This, then,  is the fate which has been reserved for me so carefully these  two hundred years!  a beauty as fleeting as that of the  flowers of spring ; and as a conclusion, a dress of green crape,  a singular little form, which is neither flesh nor fish, and  without blood or bones. I am very unfortunate !  Alas ! a  crown would have covered all my defects; I should have  found a husband worthy of me; and if I had remained a  shepherdess, the charming Sans-pair wished but for the  possession of my heart ! He is but too amply revenged for  my unjust disdain. Here am I, a grasshopper! doomed to  chirrup day and night, whilst my heart, full of bitterness,  invites me to weep!"

The Princess, delighted, flung herself into the arms of Be-  nigne, and by the tears which flowed down her cheeks, proved  to her that excess of joy had rendered her speechless. Sans-  pair knelt before the generous Fairy, respectfully kissed  her hands, and uttered a thousand unconnected sentences.  Trasimene embraced him heartily ; and Benigne, in a few  words, informed them that she had hardly ever quitted them,   that it was she who had proposed to Brilliante to blow  into the white and yellow muff,  ^that she had assumed the  form of an old shepherdess in order to take the Princess as  a lodger,  and that it was she also who had directed the Prince  which way he should go in search of his shepherdess.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1854'>There was once upon a time a King and a Queen who  wanted nothing to^make them happy but children. The  Queen was akeady aged; she had lost all hopes of having  any  when she found herself likely to become a mother, and  in due time brought into the world the most beautiful girl  that was ever seen. Joy was extreme in the palace; each  person was endeavouring to find a name for the Princess that  would express their feeling towards her. At last they called  her Aim6e. The Queen had engraved upon a turquoise-  heart the name of Aim6e, daughter of the King of the Happy  Island ; she tied it round the Princess"s neck, believing that  the turquoise would bring her good fortune. But the rule  failed in this case; for one day, when, to amuse the nurse,  they took her out to sea in the finest summer weather, all  at once there arose so tremendous a tempest that it was  impossible to land, and as she was in a little boat, which was  only used for pleasure trips close in-shore, it soon went to  pieces. The nurse and all the sailors perished. The little  Princess, who was sleeping in her cradle, remained floating  upon the water, and was ultimately thrown by the waves on  the coast of a very pretty country, but which was scarcely  inhabited since the Ogi*e Eavagio and his wife Tourmentine  had come to live there : they ate up everybody. The Ogres  are terrible people : when once they have tasted fresh meat  (it is thus they term human flesh), they will hardly ever eat  anything else ; and Tourmentine always found out some secret  manner of attracting a victim, for she was half a feiiry.</paragraph>

Her beauty increased with her age,  and they might well say of her that Love, the Graces, and  all the goddesses combined, never possessed so many  charm&amp; It appeared, when she was in the dark cavern with  Ravagio, Toormentine, and the yoimg Ogres, that the sun,  stars, and skies had descended into it. llie cruelty of these  monsters had the effect of making her still gentler j and from  the moment she was aware of their terrible inclination  for human flesh, she was always endeavouring to save the  unfortunate people who fell into their hands, so much so  that she often exposed herself to their fury. She would have  been sacrificed to it had not the young Ogre guarded her like  the apple of his eye. Ah! what will not love do? This little  monster"s nature had become softened by seeing and loving  this beautiful Princess; but, alas! what was her grief when  she thought she must marry this detestable lover ! Although  she knew nothing of her birth, she had rightly guessed from her  rich clothes, the gold chain, and the turquoise, that she was  of good birth, and she believed so still more from the feelings  of her heart. She neither knew how to read or write, nor  any language ; she spoke the jargon of the Ogres ; she lived  in perfect ignorance of all worldly matters; she possessed,  however, as fine principles of virtue, and as sweet and un-  affected manners, as though she had been brought up in the  most pob"shed court in the universe. She had made herself a  tiger-skin dress, her arms were half naked, she wore a quiver  and arrows over her shoulder, and a bow at her side. Her  fiur hair was &amp;stened only by a platted band of sea-rushes,  and floated in the breeze over her neck and shoulders. She  also wore buckskins, made of the same rush. In this attire,  she walked about the woods like a second Diana ; and she  would never have known she was beautiful if the crystal foun-  tains had not been innocent mirrors for her  which she gazed  into without their inducing her to be vain, or think more of  herself. The sun had a similar effect upon her complexion,  as upon wax ; it made it whiter, and the sea air could not tan  it. She never ate anything but what she took in hunting or  fishing, and under this pretext she often absented herself from  the horrible cavern, to avoid looking at the most deformed  objects in nature. " Heavens!" cried she, in shedding tears,  *" what have I done, that thou hast destined me to be the</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1913'>When the weather was rough, and she thought the sea had  cast some unfortunate persons on shore, she would carefiiUy go  and assist them, and prevent them from approaching the Ogieflf  cavern. It had been blowing fearfully throughout one night:  she arose as soon as it was day, and ran towai"ds the sea. She  perceived a man, who, with his arms locked round a plank,  was trying to gain the shore, notwithstanding the violence of  the waves, which continually repulsed him. The Princess was  most anxious to help him; she made signs to him, to indi-  cate the easiest landing places ; but he neither saw nor beard  her. Sometimes he came so close, that it appeared he had  but one step to make, when a wave would cover him, and he  disappeared. At last he was thrown upon the sand, and lay  stretched on it without motion. Aimee drew near him, and,  notwithstanding his death-like appearance, she rendered him  all the assistance she could. She always carried about her  certain herbs, the odour of which was so powerful, it recovered  any one from the longest fainting-fit. She pressed them in  her hands, and rubbed his lips and temples with some of  them. He opened his eyes, and was so astonished at the  beauty and the dress of the Princess, that he could hardly  determine if it were a dream or reality. He spoke first ; she  spoke in her turn. They could not understand each other,  and looked at one another with much attention, mingled with  astonishment and pleasure. The Princess had only seen some  poor fishermen that the Ogres had entrapped, and whom she  had saved, as I have already said. What must she, then, have  thought, when she saw the handsomest and best made man in  the world, most magnificently dressed ! It was, in short, the  Prince Aim^, her cousin-german, whose fleet, driven by a  tempest, had gone to pieces on these shoals, and their crews,  at the mercy of the winds and waves, had perished, or been  cast upon unknown shores.

The Prince, fearing  she was about to faint, evinced great anxiety, and would have  taken her hand, but she rrptdsed him, and endeavoiu*ed, as  well as she could, to impress upon him that he must go away.  She b^an to run before him ; then retiuned, and made signs  to him to do so. He accordingly ran from her, and returned.  When he returned, she was angry with him; she took her  arrows, and pointed them to her heart, to signify to him that  he would be killed. He thought she wished to kill him ; he  knelt on one knee, and awaited the blow. When she saw  that, she knew not what to do, or how to express herself; and,  looking at him tendierly, " What," said she, " must thou, then,  be the victim of my frightful hosts 1  ^must these very eyes,  which now gaze on thee with so much pleasure, see thee torn  in pieces, and devoured without mercy?" She wept; and the  Prince was quite at a loss to comprehend the meaning of her  actions. She succeeded, however, in making him understand  she did not wish him to follow her. She took him by the  hand, and led him into a cave in a rock, the mouth of which  opened towards the sea. It was very deep : she often went  there to deplore her misfortunes ; sometimes she slept there,  when the sun was too powerful to return to the Ogres" cavern ;  and, as she had great neatness and skill, she had furnished it  with hangings of butterflies" wings, of various colours; and  upon canes, twisted and passed one within the other, which  formed a sort of couch, she had spread a carpet of sea-rushes.  She had placed clusters of flowers in large and deep shells,  answering the purpose of vases, which she filled with water,  to preserve her bouquets. There were a thousand pretty  little things she had manu&amp;ctured, some with fish-bones and  shells, and others with the sea-rush and cane ; and these arti-  cles, notwithstanding their simplicity, were so exquisitely  made, it was easy to judge from them of the good taste and  ingenuity of the Princess.

He constrained himself to have patience, but the longer In  waited, the less hope he had. At length he determined to  die, and rushed out resolyed at all risks to seek his amiable   princess. He walked on, he knew not whither; he followed ^  a beaten path that he saw at the entrance of the wood ; after ^  walking for about an hour, he heard a noise, and perceived i  the cavern, from whence came a thick smoke; he expected  he should obtain some information there. He entered;  and he had scarcely taken a step when he saw Bavagio, who,  instantly seizing him with immense strength, would have  devoured him, had not the cries he uttered in defending him-  self reached the ears of his dear love. At the sound of that &lt;^  voice she felt nothing could stop her; she rushed out of the )  hole she slept in, and entered that part of the cavern where u  Bavagio was holding the poor Prince; she was pale and ^  trsmUing as though he would have eaten her.

When he  saw her enter his joy diminished his wretchedness, but his  grief was renewed when she showed him her wounded foot.  They wept together for some time. The Prince could not  eat, but his dear mistress cut such delicate pieces with her  own hands, and presented them to him with so much kind-  ness, that it was impossible to refuse them. She made the  young Ogres bring fresh moss, which she covered with birds"  feathers, and caused the Prince to understand it was for his  bed. Tourmentine called her; she could only bid adieu to  him by stretching out her hand; he kissed it with transports  of affection which cannot be described, and in her eyes he read  the expression of her feelings. Ravagio, Tourmentine, and  tiie Princess, slept in one of the recesses of the cavern. The  young Ogre, and five little Ogres, slept in the other, where the  Prince was. It is the custom in Ogreland, that the Ogre,  Ogress^ and the young Ogres, always sleep in their fine gold  erowna. This is the only pomp they indulge in ; and they would  rather be hung or strangled than forego it. When they were  all asleep, the Princess, who was thinking of her lover, re-  membered, that although Bavagio and Tourmentine had  given her their word of honour they would not eat him ; if  they felt hungry in the night, (which was almost always the  case when there was fi"esh meat near them,) it would be all over  with him; and the anxiety occasioned by this horrid thought,  wrought on her to such a degree, she was ready to die with  fright. After pondering for some time, she arose, hastily  threw on her tiger-skin, and groping her way without making  my noise, she entered the cavern, where the little Ogres were  uleep. She took the crown from tb.e head of the first she  came to, and put it upon that of the Prince, who was wide  Etwake, but did not dare appear to be, not knowing who was  perfonning this ceremony. The Princess then returned to  her own little bed. She had scarcely crept into it, when  Bavagio, dreaming of the good meal he might have made of  the Prince, and his appetite increasing while he thought of  it, arose in his turn, and went into the hole where the little  Ogres were sleeping.

Morning relieved the Princess of her terrible anxiety; aha  quickly sought for the Prince, and by her signs, made him  sufficiently understand her fears, and her impatience to see  him safe from the murderous teeth of these monsters. She  spoke kindly to him, and he would have uttered a thousand  kinder words to her, but for the arrival of the Ogress, iHio  came to look at her children. She perceived the oavem filled  with blood, and missed her yoimgest Ogre. She uttered  horrible shrieks. Ravagio soon found out what he had done   ^biit the evil could not be remedied. He whispered to her,  that being hungry, he had chosen the wrong, for he thou^t  he had eaten the fresh meat.</paragraph>

He could not make up his mind to go away bo  long as she was there  death would have been preferable to a  separation. He made her understand this by repeated signs;   she implored him to fly, and save his own life ; they shed  tears, pressed each other"s hands, and in their respective lan-  guages, vowed to each other reciprocal faith and everlasting  love. She could not resist showing him the clothes she had  on when Tourmentine found her, and also the cradle she was  in. The Prince recognised the arms and device of the King  of the Happy Island. At this sight he was in raptures; the  Princess remarked his transports of joy, which led her to be-  lieve that he had learned something of importance from the  sight of this cradle. She was dying to know what it meant   but how could he make her aware whose daughter she was,  and how nearly they were related? All she could make out  was, that she had great reason to rejoice.

She glided,  without uttering a word, into the young Ogres" cavern ; she  gently touched those that had crowns on their head (the  Prince was of the number), and one of the little Ogres was  gone in three mouthsfuL Aim6 and his lady-love heard all,  and trembled with fear; but Tourmentine, having accom-  plished, her purpose, now only wanted to go to sleep ; so they  were safe for the remainder of the night. "^ Heaven aid us !"  cried the Princess. " Suggest to me what we can do in such  a pressing extremity!" The Prince prayed as fervently;  sometimes he felt inclined to attack these two monsters, and  fight with them ; but what hope had he of obtaining any advan-  tage over them?  they were as tall as giants, and their skin  was proof against pistol-shot; so that he came to the more  prudent conclusion, that ingenuity could alone extricate  them from this frightful position. As soon as it was day,  and Tourmentine found the bones of her little Ogre, she  filled the air with fearful howls. Ravagio appeared in as  much despair. They were a hundred times very nearly  throwing themselves upon the Prince and Princess, and  devouring them without mercy. They had hidden them-  selves in a little dark corner, but the cannibals knew full  well where they were, and of all the perils they had encoun-  tered, this seemed the most imminent. Aim6e, racking her  brains, all at once remembered that the ivory wand which  Tourmentine possessed performed wonders; why, she herself  could not tell. "* If, notwithstanding her ignorance," said  she, " these surprising things occur, why should not my  words have as much effect?"

She told him of the power of the enchanted  wand, and he informed her of her birth, and their relation to  each other. The Princess was transported with joy; and as  nature had endowed her with extraordinary intellect, she ex-  pressed it in such choice and well-turned phrases, that the  Prince was more in love with her than ever. They had not  much time to lose in settling their affairs ; it was a question of  flight from these irritated monsters, and speedily to seek an  asylum for themselves. They promised to love each other  for ever ; and to unite their destinies, the moment they were  able to be married. The Princess told her lover, that as  soon as she saw Ravagio and Tourmentine were asleep, she  would fetch their great camel, and that they would get  on it, and go wherever it pleased heaven to conduct them.  The Prince was so delighted he could with diJ0Biculty con-  tain his joy, and many things, that still alarmed him, were  effaced by the charming prospect of the future.

" added the Ogress. *" I am  there,*" said ^e bean, *"and none ever warmed themselves  nearer." They still continued talking, for the bean kept up  the conversaticm, like a very clever b^n. Towards the morn-  ing, Tourmentine again called the Princess; but the bean  was baked, and did not answer. This silence made her  uneasy,  she got up very angry; looked about her; called;  alarmed everybody; and searched in every direction. No  Princess ! no Prince ! no little wand 1 She shrieked so loudly,  that the rocks and valleys echoed again. "" Wake up, my  poppet; awake, dear Ravagio; thy Tourmentine is betrayed.  Our firesh-meat has run away." Ravagio opened his eye, and  bounded into the middle of the cavern like a lion ; he roared,  he bellowed, he howled, he foamed. ""Quick, quick; give  me my seven-leagued boots, that I may pursue our fugitives ;  I will catch them, and swallow them before long." He put on  his boots, with which at one stride he went seven leagues.  Alas ! how was it possible to fly fast enough to escape from  such a runner?

Immediately, the pond, the  boat, and the old woman were there, and Bavagio arrived at  the water"s edge. " Hola ho ! old mother," he cried, " have  you seen a camel, and a young man and woman, pass by  here?" The old woman, who kept her boat in the middle  of the pond, put her spectacles on her nose, and looking at  Ravagio, made signs to him, that she had seen them, and that  they had passed through the meadow. The Ogre believed  her ; he went to the left. The Princess wished to take her  natural form ; she touched herself with the wand three times,  and struck the boat and the pond. She and the Prince  became young and beautiful again. They quickly mounted  the camel, and turned to the right, that they might not meet  their enemy.</paragraph>

Afl^r he had consented to her going there, and  they had taken a tender and afiectionate farewell of each  other, she started for that part of the world, with instinct  done for her guide. But to speak more correctly. Love carried  her there; and as he flies faster than the swiftest of winged  beings, he enabled her rapidly to perform this long journey.  She brought back wondeifiil balm upon her wings, and about  her little feet, with which she cured her Prince. It is true,  it was not so much by the excellence of the balm, by as the  pleasure it aflbrded him, in seeing the Princess Bee take so  much care of his wound. She applied the balm every day,  and he had much need of it ; for the severed branch was one  of his fingers ; so had they continued to treat him as Linda  had done, he would neither have had legs nor arms. Oh,  how acutely did the Bee feel for the sufierings of the Orange-  tree ! She reproached herself with being the cause, by the  impetuosity with which she defended its flowers. Linda,  alarmed at what she had seen, could neither sleep nor eat.  At last she resolved to send for some Fairies, in the hope of  being enlightened upon a matter that seemed so extraordinary.  She despatched ambassadors, laden with handsome presents,  to invite them to her court</paragraph>

In uttering these words he took hold of  the little Bee, whom he never ceased gazing upon. " Thou  shalt be satisfied," answered the generous Trufio.

They laughed, they sang, they played a thousand  tricks to amuse themselves  in short, it was the happiest of  times. Their subjects followed the example of the King and  Queen ; they emulated each other in their pastimes. For all  these reasons they called this kingdom the Land of Joy. It  happened that a king who was the neighbour of King Joyeux  lived veiy diflFerently. He was a declared enemy to pleasure.  He desired nothing but wounds and blows. He had a grim  countenance, a large beard, hollow eyes; he was all skin and  bones, always dressed in black, with hair which stood on end,  very greasy and dirty. To please him, they knocked down  and killed all travellers. He hung all criminals himself and  delighted in torturing them. When a mother was dotingly  fond of her little girl or boy, he would send for her, and  before her eyes would break the child"s arms, or wring its  neck.

Everybody trembled with fear.  They said, "With whom is he going to warl He wiU give  him no quarter." When everything was ready, he marched  towards the country of King Joyeux, who at this bad news  speedily took measures for his defence. The Queen was  frighcened to death, and crying said, "Sire, we must fly  let  us collect as much money as we can, and go to the other end  of the world." The King replied, "Fie, Madam, I have  too much courage for that. It is better to die than be  branded as a coward." He assembled all his men-at-arms,  took an affectionate farewell of his wife, moimted his beautiful  horse, and departed. When she lost sight of him, she began  to weep sadly, and clasping her hands together, said, " Alas !  if I should have an infant, and the King should be killed in  battle, I shall be a widow and a prisoner, and the wicked  King wi!l inflict a thousand cruelties upon me. This thought  prevented her from eating and sleeping. She wrote to him  every day; but one morning, looking from the battlements,  she saw a courier coming at full speed. She called to him,  "Ho, Courier, ho! What news?" "The King is dead," said  he; "the battle is lost; the wicked King will be here imme-  diately." The poor Queen swooned, and they carried her to  bed. All her ladies were around her, crying one for her  father, another for her son, and tearing their hair: it was  the most distressing thing in the world. All on a sudden  they heard cries of "Murder! Thieves!" It was the wicked  King, who had arrived with all his wretched followers, killing  every one they met with. He entered the Royal Palace in com-  plete armour, and ascended to the Queen"s chamber. When she  saw him enter, she was so frightened that she hid herself in the  bed, and pulled the counterpane over her head. He called to  her two or three times, but she never spoke a word. He  grew angry, and said very fiercely, " Dost thou make sport of  me ! dost know that I might strangle thee instantly 1" He  pulled the bed-clothes off her, and tore off her cap : her  beautiful hair fell all about her shoulders ; he twisted it three  times round his hand, and threw her over his shoulders like a  sack of com; he carried her thus down-stairs, and mounted  with her upon his large black horse.

He carried  her into his own country, and to wed all the way that he would  bang her, but he was told it would be a pity, as she was about  to become a mother. When he discovered that, it occurred to  him, that if she had a daughter, he would marry his son to  her, and to ascertain which it would be, he sent for a Faiiy  who lived near to his dominions. When she arrived, he  entertained her better than was his custom ; he then took hex  up into a tower, at the top of which the poor Queen occupied  a very small and iU-f unused room. She was lying on the  ground, upon a mattress not worth two-pence, and where she  cried day and night When the Fairy saw her, she could not  help pitying her; she curtsied to her, and, embracing her,  said in a low voice, " Take courage. Madam, your misfortunes  will not last for ever. I hope to hasten the term of them."  The Queen was consoled a little by these words, returned the  Fairy"s embraces, and begged her to have pity upon a poor  princess who had enjoyed the greatest happiness, and was  now equally miserable. They were in close conversation,  when the wicked King exclaimed, " Come ! no more compli-  ments.

" My liege," said the Princess, " to indi-  cate that we should unceasingly implore for you the protec-  tion of the Gods, and also that the sight of you is to me like  that of heaven and all the starry host!" "You speak like  an oracle ! " said the King. " And you, Merveilleuse ; what  reason had you for dressing yourself in white?" "Because,  Sire," she answered, " it becomes me better than any colour.**  " How ! " cried the King, very much ofiFended ; " was that  yoiu* only motive, you little coquette?" " My motive was to  please you," said the Princess; "it appears to me that I  ought to have no other." The King, who loved her dearly,  was so perfectly satisfied with this explanation, that he  declared himself much pleased by the little turn she had  given to her meaning, and the art with which she had at first  concealed the compliment. *" There! there!" said he, "I  have made an excellent supper. I shall not go to bed yet  Tell me what you all dreamed of the night before my return."  The eldest said she dreamed that he had brought her a  gown, the gold and jewels of which shone brighter than the  sun. The second said she dreamed that he had brought her a  golden distaff to spin herself some shifts with. The youngest  said she dreamed that he had married her second sister,  and that on the wedding-day he held a golden ewer, and said,  " Merveilleuse, come hither and wash."</paragraph>

"* If I were an ill-natured girl^" said she to  herself, " I should go home directly and leave my sisters to  die here, for they beat me and scratch me till the blood  comes. But notwithstanding all their malice, I will not  abandon them." She aroused them, and told them the whole  story. They began to cry, and begged her to take them with  her, promising that they would give her beautiful dolls, a  child"s set of silver plate, and all their other toys and sweet-  meats. " I am quite sure you will do no such thing," said  Finette ; " but I will behave as a good sister should, for all  that." And so saying she rose, and followed the clue with  the two princesses, so that they reached home almost as soon  as the Queen. Whilst they were at the door, they heard the  King say, ** It gives me the heart-ache to see you come back  alone." " Pshaw !" said the Queen, " our daughters were too  great an incumbrance to us." " But," said the King, "if you  had brought back my Finette, I might have consoled myself  for the loss of the others, for they loved nothing and nobody."  At that moment they knocked at the door  ^rap, rap. "Who  is there 1" said the King. "Your three daughters," they  replied, "Fleur d" Amour, Belle-de-Nuit, and Fine-Oreille."  The Queen began to tremble. " Don"t open the door," she  exclaimed; "it must be their ghosts, for it is impossible  they could find their way back alive." The King, who was  as great a coward as his wife, called out, " It is false; you are  not my daughters ! " but Fine-Oreille, who was a shrewd girl,  said to him, " Papa, I will stoop down, and do you look at  me through the hole made for the cat to come through, and  if I am not Finette, I consent to be whipped." The King  looked as she told him to do, and as soon as he recognised  her, he opened the door. The Queen pretended to be de-  lighted to see them again, and said, " that she had forgotten  something, and had come home to fetch it ; but that most  assuredly she should have returned to them." They pre-  tended to believe her, and went up to a snug little hay-loft,  in which they always slept.</paragraph>

When they  had beaten her as much as they chose, they let her go to bed,  but as she was covered with wounds and bruises, she could not  sleep, and she heard the Queen say to the King, "" I will take  them in another direction, much further, and I am confident  they will never return." When Finette heard this plot, she  rose very softly to go and see her godmother again. She went  into the hen-yard and took two hens and a cock, and wrung  their necks, also two little rabbits that the Queen was fatten-  ing upon cabbages, to make a feast of on the next occasion.  She put them all into a basket and set off: but she had not  gone a league groping her way and quaking with fear, when  the Spanish horse came up at a gallop, snorting and neighing.  She thought it was all over with her; that some soldiers were  about to seize her.

You will walk on the ashes, and when you wish to return you  will have only to follow your footmarks; but do not bring  your sisters back with you. They are too malicious, and if  you do bring them back I will never see you again." Finette  took leave of her, taking away by her order thirty or forty  millions of diamonds in a little box, which she put in her  pocket. The horse was ready in waiting, and carried her  home as before. At daybreak the Queen called the Princesses.  They came to her, and she said to them, " The King is not  very well; I dreamed last night that I ought to go and  gather for Mm some flowers and herbs in a certain country  " where they grow in great perfection.

Although she was perfectly prepared for it,  she could not help crying, trusting for her return much more  to the power of her fairy godmother than to the cleverness of  her sisters. She went to them in a great fright, and said,  "The Queen is gone; we must follow her as quickly as pos-  sible." " Hold thy tongue, little mischievous animal," replied  Fleur d" Amour; "we can find our way well enough when we  choose; you are making a great fuss at a wrong season,  gossip." Finette durst not make any answer. When, how-  ever, they did try to retrace their steps, there were no signs or  paths to be found. There are immense flocks of pigeons in  that country, and they had eaten up all the peas. The Prin-  cesses began to cry and scream with grief and terror. After  being two days without food, Fleur d"Amour said to Belle-de-  Kuit, ""Sister, hast thou nothing to eat?" ** Nothing," she  replied. She put the same question to Finette. " Nor liave  I," she answered, " but I have just found an acorn." " Ah !  give it to me," said one ; " Give it to me," said the other.  Each insisted on having it. "An acorn will not go far  amongst three of us," said Finette ; " let us plant it ; there may  spring a tree from it which may be useful to us." They con-  sented, although there was little chance of a tree growing in  a country where none were to be seen. They could find  only cabbages and lettuces, on which the Princesses lived.

It began  to grow so fast that you could see it grow.

Belle-de-Nuit was not more  successful. Finette, being lighter, managed to get up and  remain a long time. Her sisters called to her, " Canst thou  see anything, sister?" She answered, " No, I can see nothing."  " Ah, then, the oak is not tall enough," said Fleur d" Amour;  so they continued to water it, and say, " Grow, grow, beautiful  acorn!" Finette never failed climbing it twice a-day. One  morning when she was up in the tree, Belle-de-Nuit said to  Fleur d" Amour, " I have found a bag which our sister has  hidden from us. What can there be in it?" Fleur d" Amour  replied, " She told me it contained some old lace she bad got  to mend." " I believe it is full of sugar-plums," said BeUe-  de-Nuit. She had a sweet tooth, and determined to ascertain  the fact She opened the bag, and found in it actually a  quantity of old lace belonging to the King and Queen, but  hidden beneath it were the fine clothes the Fairy had given  to Finette, and the box of diamonds. " Well, now ! was there  ever such a sly little rogue?" exclaimed Belle-de-Nuit; "we  will take out all the things, and put some stones in their  place."

They immediately opened a saloon paved  with marble, painted and gilded, which was one of the best in  the palace. He entered it with part of his suite, but as  monkeys are always great ferreters by profession, they found  a certain comer in which had been arranged a quantity of jars  of preserves.

It was not a very difficult matter ; since  she had spoken they no longer tied her up; she went out and  came in and entered her room as often by the window as by  the door. She hiuried, therefore, away, jumping from tree to  tree, from branch to branch, till she came to the banks of a  river. The excess of her despair prevented her from compre-  hending the peril she should incur by attempting to swim  across, and without pausing even to look at it, she flung her-  self in, and immediately went to the bottom ; but as she did  not lose her senses, she perceived a magnificent grotto, orna-  mented with shells. She entered it quickly, and was received  by a very old man, whose long white beard descended to his  waist : he was reclining on a couch of reeds and flags, and  was crowned with poppies and wild lilies, and was leaning  against a rock, out of which flowed several fountains which  fed the river. " Ah ! what brings thee here, little Babiole 1"  said he, holding out his hand to her. " My Lord," she replied,  *" I am an unfortunate ape I I am flying from a horrible  fnonkey, whom they want me to marry."

The  Queen"s ladies disturbed the whole palace by their screams.  The King put on his dressing-gown, and ran to the Queen"s  apartments. The fii-st thing he saw was the cat, in the  swaddling clothes of cloth-of-gold, worn usually by his infant  son. They had thrown it on the ground, where it was squall-  ing wonderfully. The King was much alarmed, and inquired  what it meant. They told him that they knew nothing at  all about it, but that the little Prince was not to be seen,  that they sought for him in vain, and that the Queen was  much hurt.

The  man who carried him gathered some figs, and put them in his  mouth ; the sweetness of the fimit quieted him a little^ and  thus the man continued to carry him till the following night,  when he came to a large and dark forest. He would not  enter it at that hour, for fear of being devoured himself but  the next morning he resumed his journey, still carrying the  basket. The forest was so large that whichever way he  looked he could see no end to it, but in a spot thickly ear-  rounded with trees, he perceived a rock, terminating in several  3^8S^ peaks. " Here, no doubt," said he, " is the retreat of  the most savage beasts. I must leave the in&amp;nt here, since  I am not in a situation to save it." He approached the rock.  Immediately an eagle, of a prodigious size, rushed out, flying  round and round, as though she had left something in her  nest; in &amp;ct it was her young ones, whom she was feeding,  at the bottom of a sort of grotto. " Thou wilt be the prey  of these birds, who are the kings of others, poor child," said  the man. With that he unswathed it, and laid it down  beside the three eaglets. Their nest was large, and sheltered  firom the inclemency of the weather. He had much trouble  in putting the Prince there, because the side of the rock by  which it could be approached was very rugged and overhimg  a frightful precipice. He withdrew sighing, and saw the eagle  returning swiftly to its nest. ** Ah," said he, " there is an end  of it ! the child will soon be no more." He hurried away,  that he might not hear its last cries. He returned to the  humpback, and assured him that he no longer had&gt; a brother.  At this news the barbarous Prince embraced his faithful  minister, and gave him a diamond ring, assuring him that  when he became king he would make him captain of his army.  The eagle, on returning to her nest, was perhaps- surprised to  find the new guest in it; surprised or not, she exercised the  rights of hospitality better than many people could have done.  She nestled close to her nursling, covered him with her wings,  and warmed him. It seemed as if she had no longer any care  but for him ; a peculiar instinct induced her to seek fruits for  him, to peck them, and to pour the juice into the rosy mouth  of the little Prince; in short, she fed him so well that his  royal mother could not have nursed him better. As soon as  the eaglets became stronger, the eagle took them out by</paragraph>

The eagles sometimes left their mother, and  flew a little around her, hut the little Prince could do nothing  of this sort, and when c^e carried him in the air, he ran great  risks of fidling and killing himself Fortune befriended him.  It was she who had provided so extraordinary a nurse for him;  it was she who prevented his falling. Four years passed in  this manner. The eagle lost all her young ones, they flew  away when they were big enough ; they never returned to see  their mother or their nest. The Prince, who had not strength  to go far, remained upon the rock, for the prudent and  anxious eagle, apprehensive of his Mling down the precipicCi  carried him to the other side, and lodged him in so narrow a  cleft that the wild beasts could not get to him. Loye, whom  they paint as perfect, was far less so than this young Prince.  The heat of the sun could not tarnish the lUies and roses  of his complexion ; there was so much regularity in all his  features, that the finest painters could not imagine anything  to equal them ; his hair was already long enough to fisdl over  his [Moulders, and he had so lofty a mien that there had never  been seen in a child anything so noble and grand. The ea^e  loved him with an overwhelming affection ; she fed him with  nothing but fruit, making this difference between him and  her eaglets, to whom she gave only raw flesh. She ruined all  the shepherds around in carrying away all their lambs|, with-  out mercy; nothing was talked of but the ravages of the  eagle. At last, tired of feeding her at the expense of their  flocks, they resolved amongst themselves to discover her  retreat They separated in "several parties, following her  flight ; roaming the mountains and the valleys for a long time  without success ; but one day they saw her ahght upon a  groat rock; the most courageous of the party ventured to  ascend it, although surrounded by a thousand dangers. The  bird had at that time two little eaglets that she carefully  tended, but dear as they were to her. her affection was still  stronger for the young Prince, with whom she bad been  longer acquainted. As she was not in her nest when the  shepherds discovered it, they had not much diflBculty in pull-  ing it to pieces, and carrying off" its contents ; but what was  thoir surprise at beholding the Prince ! There was something</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3397'>They carried away the child and the eaglets, all three  screaming together. The eagle heard them, and came swoop-  ing down upon the ravishers of her property. They would  have felt the effects of her fury if she had not been shot  dead by an arrow which one of the shepherds let fly at her.  The young Prince, full of natural feeling, seeing her fall,  uttered pitiful cries, and wept bitterly. After this adven-  ture the shepherds returned to their villages. A cruel cere-  mony was to take place the next morning, for the following  reason:  ^This country, for a long time past, had been the  resort of ogres. The inhabitants, alarmed at such dangerous  neighbours, had tried every means to get rid of them, with-  out success. These terrible ogres, incensed by the hatred that  was manifested towards them, redoubled their cruelties, and  deyoured, without exception, all who fell into their hands.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3398'>One day that the shepherds had assembled to deliberate on  the steps that should be taken against the ogres, all at once,  in the midst of them appeared a man of tremendous size ;  half of his body was like that of a stag, covered with a blue  skin. He had the feet of a goat, a club over his shoulder, and  a buckler in his hand. He said to them, " Shepherds, I am  the Blue Centaur ; if you give me a child every three years,  I promise to bring here a hundred of my brothers, and make  such fierce war upon the ogres, that we will drive them out,  whatever may be their numbers."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3399'>The shepherds hesitated to agree to do anything so cruel, but  the most venerable amongst them said, "WImt then, my  friends, is it more advantageous to us that the ogres should  each day eat our fethers, our children, and our wives? By  sacrificing one we should save many. Do not let us then  refuse the offer the Centaur has made us." Upon this they  all consented to it. They pledged themselves by sacred oaths  to keep their word with the Centaur, and that the child  should be ready for him.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3400'>He departed, and returned, as he promised, with his  brothers, who were all as monstrous as himself. The ogres  were as brave as they were cniel. They fought several battles,  in which, however, the Centaurs were always victorious, and  at last obliged them to fly. The Blue Centaur appeared to</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3403'>daim his reward. Every one said nothing could be more just ;  but when they came to select the proooosed child, there was  not a &amp;mily who would make up their minds to give one of  theirs ; the mothers hid their in&amp;mts almost in the bosom of  the earth. The Centaur, who would not be trifled with, after  having waited twice four-and-twenty hours, told the shepherds  that he expected they would give him as many children as  he stayed days with them, and the delay cost iiiexn six httk  boys and six little girls. From that time forth they rogu-  lated this serious a^r, and every third year they made a  solemn ceremony on the delivery of the poor child to the  Centaur.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='3404'>It was, then, the following morning after the Prince bad  been taken from the eagle"s nest that this tribute was due,  and although the child had been already chosen, it is easy  to believe the shepherds willingly substituted the Prince:  the imcertainty of his birth  ^for they were so simple they  sometimes believed the eagle was his mother  and his wonder-  ful beauty, decided them absolutely to present him to the  Centaur, for he was so dainty he would not eat children that  were not very pretty. The mother of the infanfc they had  selected, relieved from the horror of contemplating the death  of"her child, found her despair thus suddenly changed into joy.  They desired her to adorn the young Prince for the sacrifice,  as she had previously her son. She carefully combed his long  hair, and made him a crown of little red and white hedge-  roses. She dressed him in a long robe of fine white linen,  with a girdle of flowers; thus adorned, he marched at the  head of several children who were to accompany him ; but  how can I describe his lofty air, or the nobleness that already  sparkled in his eyes. He who had never seen anything but  eagles, and who was still of so tender an age, appeared neither  frightened nor wild; it seemed to him that all those shepherds  had assembled "merely to please him. "Ah, what a pity!"  said they to each other; " what, is this child going to be de-  voured] can we not save it?" Many wept, but it was impos-  sible to avoid making the sacrifice.</paragraph>

This wise old man was able to give  him the best advice; for he had been a king of a fine and  flourishing kingdom, but a usurper, a neighboiur and an  enemy, successfully conducted his secret intrigues, and gained  over certain factious spirits, who rose in rebellion, and enabled  him to surprise <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='kingdom;king;family;usurper;enemy;advice;spirit;^;neighboiur;rebellion;intrigue;fortress;man' adjectives='old;certain;factious;able;secret;wise;fine;best;flourishing' verbs='be;shut;enable;intend;perish;give;rise;gain;have;conduct;surprise;order' valence='5.63432432432' arousal='4.27135135135' dominance='5.57216216216'>the king</entity> and all his family, whom he imme-  diately ordered to be shut up in a fortress^ where he intended  them to perish miserably.</paragraph>

At the end of three  years the king gained over one of his guards, who agreed to  bring a small boat for him to cross the lake, in the middle of  which the fortress was built. He provided them with a file  to cut the iron bars of their rooms, and with cords to descend  by. They fixed upon a very dark night. Everything was  favourable ; and without any noise, the guard assisted them to  slide down the walls, that were frightfiiUy high : the king went  down first, then followed the daughters, afterwards the queen,  then the little princess in a large basket ; but, alas ! they had  tied her in badly, and suddenly they heard her fall into the  lake. If the queen had not feinted from grief, she would  have awakened all the garrison by her shrieks and lamenta-  tions. The king, distressed at this accident, sought for the  child as much as it was possible in so dark a night : he found  the basket, and hoped the princess was in it; but she waa not  there, and he was obliged to row to save himself and the rest of  the family.

Here they enjoyed more peace than they  had on their throne ; no one envied them their poverty, they  feared neither traitors nor flatterers; their days flew by  without sorrow, and the king often said, "" Ah ! if men could  cure themselves of ambition, how happy they would be !

How could she have entered it?  It was the road by which the fairies went to the foimtain,  and was generally closed by brambles and thorns ; but when  the Queen and her conductress presented themselves, roses  immediately appeared upon the brambles, jasmine and orange-  trees interlaced their branches, to form an arbour covered by  leaves and flowers.

" Alas !" said she, "I thought I had nothing to  fear but the Fairv of the Fountain, and fiie cruel inhabitants  of the forests ; but to-day I have been pursued by a young  hunter, whom I scarcely saw, so hasty was my flight. A  thousand arrows, shot after me, threatened me with inevitable  death; I am still ignorant by what good fortime I could  have been able to escape." "You must not go out any more,  my Princess," replied Giroflle ; " pass in this chamber the  fatal time of your penance.

There were even some  J whispers in circulation that they sought to make partizans  ivith a view of depriving him of his kingdom. The King felt  he was growing old; but his mental capacity being undi-  minished, he had no fancy for vacating in their fevour a place  he filled so worthily. He thought, therefore, that the best  way to live in peace, was by amusing them with promises  which he could always elude the performance of He called  them into his closet, and after having spoken very kindly to  them he added, " You will agree with me, my dear children,  that my great age forbids my applying myself to the business  of the State with so much assiduity as formerly. I fear my  subjects may suffer from this circumstance. I wish to trans-  fer my crown to one of you ; but to deserve such a gift, it is  but just that you should on your parts seek to please me.  Now, as I contemplate retiring into the country, it appears  to me that a pretty, faithful, and intelligent little dog would  be an excellent companion for me. So in lieu of prefening  my eldest to my youngest son, I declare to you, that which-  ever of you three shall bring me the handsomest little dog  shall forthwith become my heir."</paragraph>

He recounted to her the success of his journey,  whi|4i she knew perhaps better than he did, and that the  king wanted a piece of cloth which could pass through the  eye of a needle ; that in truth he believed it was impossible  to find such a thing, but that he had not hesitated to make  the attempt, relying implicitly upon her friendship and assist-  ance. White Cat, assuming a more serious air, told him it  was a matter that demanded consideration ; that, fortunately,  there were some cats in her castle who spun exceeding]br "^^W*^  that she would put a ciaw to it herself, and iotwx^^</paragraph>

Four cats were to be  burnt there, that had been tried and sentenced in due form.  They were accused of having eaten the roast meat provided  for the White Cat"s supper, her cheese, her milk, and even  of having conspired against her life with Martafisix and L"Her-  mite, two famous rats of that country, and held as sach by  La Fontaine, a very faithful historian : but with all that, it 1  was well known there was a great deal of eabal in the matter,  and that the majority of the witnesses had been tampered  with. However this might be, the Prince obtained their par-  don. The fireworks did no injury to any one, and never yet  were seen such splendid sky-rockets.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='4309'>After this, a very nice supper was served, which gave the  Prince more gratification than the fireworks, for he was very  hungry, and the wooden horse had brought him at such  a pace that he had never ridden so hard before in his life.  The following days were passed like those that had preceded  them, in a thousand various entertainments with which the  ingenious White Cat regaled her guest.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='4310'>It is true that White Cat was possessed of agreeable,  sweet, and almost universal talent. She was wiser than a cat  is allowed to be. The Prince was sometimes astonished at  her knowledge. " No," said he, *" it is not natural for you to  possess all these wonderful qualities I discover in you. If you  love me, charming Pussy, explain to me by what miracle you  are enabled to think and speak so perfectly, that you might  be elected a member of the most famous Academy of .Aits  and Sciences"?" "Cease to question me, Son of a King,"  said she to him ; " I am not allowed to answer; and thou  mayest carry thy conjectures as far as thou wilt without my  contmdicting thee. Let it suffice that I have always a velvet  paw for thee, and that I take an affectionate interest in all  that concerns thee."</paragraph>

The Prince could scarcely think of anything that the diligent  hands did not instantly provide him with, whether books,  jewels, pictures, antique medals ; in short, he had but to say,  i want a certain gem that is in the cabinet of the Great  Mogul or of the King of Persia, or such a statue in Corinth  or any part of Greece, and he saw it instantly before him,  without knowing how it came or who brought it. This was  not without its charms, and as a relaxation, it is sometimes  very agreeable to see oneself the possessor of the finest trea-  sures in the world.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='4314'>White Cat, who was ever watchful for the Prince"s welfare,  warned him that the hour of departure was approaching, that  he might make himself easy about the piece of cloth which  he required, and that she had made a most wonderful one  for him. She added, that it was her intention, this time, to  furnish him with an equipage worthy his birth ; and, without  waiting for his reply, she compelled him to look into the  great court-yard of the castle. He saw in it an open caleche,  of gold, enamelled flame-colour, with a thousand gallant  devices, which satisfied the mind as much as the eye. It was  drawn by twelve horses as white as snow, four-and-four  abreast, their harness being of flame-coloured velvet em-  broidered with diamonds and plated with gold. The caliche  was hned to match, and a hundred coaches, each with eight  horses, filled with noblemen of high bearing, very superbly  attired, followed the caliche. There was also an escort of  a thousand body-guards, whose uniforms were so covered  with embroidery that you could not see the stuff they were  made of It was a remarkable feature of this cavalcade that  the portrait of White Cat was to be observed in every part  of it, either in the devices on the caliche or on the uniforms  of the body-guard, or attached by a riband to the doublets of  those who formed the train, as if it were a new order with  which she had decorated them.</paragraph>

We should have some  difficulty in believing the speed with which he travelled if we  were not already aware of the way in which the wooden  horse had carried him in less than two days a distance of five  hundred leagues from the castle; so that, impelled by the  same power, these other steeds travelled so swiftly that thej  were only four and twenty hours on the road, stopping  nowhere till they reached the King"s palace, to which the two  elder brothers had already repaired, and, not seeing their  youngest, congratulated themselves on his negligence, and  whispered to each other, "&lt; Here s a piece of good luck !

He cracked that also, and was surprised to see in it a  oherry-stone. Everybody looked at one another, and the King  laughed in his sleeve, and jeered at the notion of his son being  credulous enough to believe he could bring a whole piece of  cloth in a walnut; but why should he not have believed it,  when he had already given him a little dog that had come  out of an acorn 1 He therefore cracked the cherry-stone,  which was fiUed vdth its kernel. A great murmur then arose  in the apartment. Nothing was heard but the opinion that  the young Prince had been duped in this adventure. He  made no answer to the raillery of the courtiers ; he opened  the kernel and found in it a grain of wheat, and in the grain  of wheat a millet seed. Ah ! In truth, he began to doubt, and  muttered between his teeth, "White Cat, White Cat, thou hast  fooled me!** At that moment he felt a cat"s claw upon his  hand, which gave him such a scratch that the blood came.  He knew not whether this scratch was given to encourage or  to dishearten him; nevertheless, he opened the millet seed,  and great was the astonishment of the whole company when  he drew out of it a piece of cloth four hundred ells in length,  so wonderfully wrought, that all the birds, beasts, and fishes  were seen in their natural colours, with the trees, fruits, and  plants of the earth ; the rocks, curiosities, and E^ells of the  ocean; the sun, the moon, the great and lesser stars and  planets of the sky. There were sdso the portraits of all the  kings and other sovereigns at that time reigning in the  world, with those of their wives, of their mistresses, of their  chil4ren, and of all their subjects, not forgetting the  tiniest little urchin ; -every one, in his particular class of  life, accurately represented, and dressed in the habit of his  country.</paragraph>

All his train followed him, and he  took the road back to his dear White Cat. She luiew the  day and the moment he would arrive. All the way was  strewn with flowers; thousands of vases of perfume smoked  on all sides, and particularly within the castle. White Cat  was seated on a Persian carpet, under a pavilion of cloth of  gold, in a gallery, from whence she could see him approach.  He was received by the hands that had always attended upon  him.

He was reposing beneath a rich pavilion of cloth of  gold, and surroimded by a very numerous Court. I felt  aotisfied he was the son of some king who reigned in the  Ticinity of the Fairies" Palace. As I feared that if he returned  to the tower he would be discovered by the terrible Dragon,  I went and fetched my parrot, and told him to fly to that  mountain, where he would find the person who had spoken to  me, and beg him in my name never to come again, as I was  alarmed at the vigilance of my guardians, and the probability  of their doing him some mischief. Perroquet executed his  commission like a parrot of sense. The courtiers were all  surprised to see him come flying at full speed, perch upon  their master"s shoulder and whisper in his ear. The King (for  such he proved to be) was both delighted and troubled by this  message. My anxiety on his account was flattering to his heart ;  but the many difficulties there were in the way of his speaking  with me, distressed without being able to dissuade him from  the attempt to make himself agreeable to me. He asked Per-  roquet a hundred questions, and Perroquiet asked him as many  in return, for he was naturally inquisitive. The King gave  him a ring to bring me in return for my turquoise. It was a  turquoise also ; but much finer than mine, and cut in the shape  of a heart, and surrounded with diamonds. " It is fit," said  he to the parrot, " that I should treat you as an ambassador.

They  named several, and fixed at last upon little King Migonnet,  whose kingdom was about five hundred leagues off; but that  was a trifle. Perroquet overheard this fine councU. He  flew to give me an account of it, and said to me, " Ah, how  I pity you, my dear mistress, if you should become the Queen  of Migonnet !

The noise  they both made woke me ; they acquainted me with the cause  of it. I ran, or rather flew, to my window. I saw the King,  who extended his arms towards me, and said through his  trumpet that he could no longer live without me; that he  implored me to find means to escape from my tower, or to  enable him to enter it.

"And who  has told you," I exclaimed, * that I desire to be married? It  is very far from my intention. Send King Migonnet away  again, I will not add a pin to my dress; let him think me  handsome or ugly, I am not going to be his." " Hey day !  Hey day!" rejoined the Fairy, * Here"s a little rebel! Here"s  a head without any brains in it !

What dost thou mean by that term?" interrupted Fortune.  " Gifted means, that he has received one or more gifts from  fairies," added the horse ; " you must engage him to go with  us." At the same time, advancing to where the woodcutter  was at work, the young Chevalier accosted him with a gentle  and winning air, and asked him several questions about the  place they were in ; whether there were any wild beasts in the  forest, and if he would be permitted to hunt in it The  "woodcutter replied to everything like an intelligent man.  Fortune then inquired, where the men were gone, who had  been helping him to fell so many trees. The woodcutter  replied that he had felled them all by himself, that it had  been the work of a few hours, and that he must cut down  many others to make a load for himself. " What ! Do you  pretend you will carry all this wood to-day?" said the Che-  valier. " Oh, my Lord," replied Strong-back^ (for thus people  called him,) " my strength is extraordinary." " You make a  great deal of money, then," said Fortun6.

Come with me, you shall not want for anything,  and when you would wish to return, I will give you money  for your journey."

He was not satisfied with dressing  himself magnificently; he wished his seven attendants who  accompanied him to make as good an appearance: and as  ithey had all of them excellent horses, and Comrade seemed  rather to fly through the air, than to gallop over the ground,  they arrived in a very little time at the capital city in which  the Emperor Matapa resided. It was larger than <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='constantinople;cellar;garret;eome;loft' adjectives='larger;populated' verbs='put;be;inhabit' valence='5.58166666667' arousal='3.48833333333' dominance='5.37166666667'>Paris</entity>,  Constantinople, and Eome put together, and so populated,  that all the cellars, garrets, and lofts were inhabited.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='4768'>F^rtun6 waa surprised to see a city of such a prodigious  extent. He demanded an audience of the Emperor; but  when he announced the subject of his embassy, although  with a grace which added much to the effect of his arguments,  the Emperor could not help smiling. " If you were at the  head of five hundred thousand men,*" said he, " one might  listen to you ; but they tell me you have but seven." ** I  never undertook, my Lord," said Fortun6, "to make you  restore what my master wishes by force, but by my very  humble remonstrances." " Neither one way nor the other,"  added the Emperor. "You will never succeed, unless you  can accomplish something that has just occurred to me. It  is, that you should find a man who has so good an appetite,  that he can eat for his breakfast all the hot bread baked for  the inhabitants of this great city."</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='4769'>The Chevalier was most agreeably surprised at this propo-  sition ; but as he did not answer directly, the Emperor burst  into a fit of laughter. " You see," said he, " it is natural to  return a ridiculous answer to a ridiculous request." " Sire,"  said Fortune, ^- 1 accept your offer. To-morrow I will bring  a man who shall eat all the new bread, and likewise all the  stale bread in this city. Oi*der it to be brought into the great  square, and you will have the pleasure of seeing him demolish  it all, to the very crumbs." The Emperor gave his assent.  Nothing was talked of for the rest of the day, but the folly  of the new ambassador; and <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='ambassador;death;word;folly;rest;t;nothing;^' adjectives='new' verbs='be;do;keep;swear;w;talk' valence='5.51142857143' arousal='4.14357142857' dominance='5.29928571429'>Matapa</entity> swore he w^^""^"^ ^^^t  him to death, if he did not keep his word.</paragraph>

He thereupon told him vhik  he had promised the Emperor. " Do not make yourself un-  easy, master," said Eater ; " I shall eat till they will be tired  of feeding me." Fort\m6, however, coidd not help fearing liie  result of his exertions, and forbade them to give him any  supper, that he might eat his breakfast the better; but this  precaution was useless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='4773'>The Emperor, the Empress, and the Princess, placed than-  selves in a balcony, that they might better see all that took  place. Fortun6 arrived with his little retinue; and he perceived  in the great square six large mountains of bread, higher than  the Pyrennees : he could not avoid turning pale. With Sater  it had a contrary effect ; for the anticipation of eating w  much good bread delighted him : he begged they would not  keep the smallest morsel from him, declariug he would not  leave a bit for a mouse. The Emperor and all the Court  amused themselves at the expense of Fortun6 and his atten-  dants ; but Eater, becoming impatient, demanded the signal  to commence. It was given to him by a flourish of drums  and trumpets : at the same instant he threw himself upon  one of the mountains of bread, which he devoured in less  than a quarter of an hour, and gulped down all the rest at  the same rate. Never was greater astonishment. Everybody  asked if their eyes had not deceived them, and went, to  satisfy themselves, by touching the place where they had placed  the bread. Every creature that day, from the Emperor to the  cat, was compelled to dine without bread.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='4774'>Fortune, delighted with his great success, approached the  Emperor, and very respectfully asked if it was agreeable for  him to keep his word with him. The Emperor, rather irri-  tated at being so duped, said, " Mr. Ambassador, it will not  do to eat so much without drinking, therefore you, or some  one of your people, must drink all the water out of the  fountains, aqueducts, and reservoirs that are in the city, and  all the wine that can be found in the cellars."

The Chevalier asked the Emperor if he would  be present ; he replied, it would be so extraordinary a thing,  that it deserved his attention, and getting into a magnificent  chariot, he drove to the Fountain of Lions: there were  seven marble lions, which threw from their mouths torrents  of water, which formed a river, upon which the inhabitants  traversed the city in gondolas. Tippler approached the great  bason, and without taking breath, he drained it as dry as  though there had never been any water in it. The fish in  the river cried vengeance against him, for they knew not  what had happened; in like manner he did by all the other  fountains, aqueducts, and reservoirs; in fact, he could have  drunk the sea, he was so thirsty. After such an example the  Emperor did not doubt but that he could drink the wine as  easily as the water, and everybody was too much provoked to  be willing to give him their own. But Tippler complained of  the great injustice they were doing him ; he said he should  have the stomach-ache, and that he not only expected the  wine, but that the spirits were also his due ; so that Matapa,  fearing he might appear covetous, consented to Tippler"s  request. Fortune took his opportunity of begging the Em-  peror to recollect his promise. At these words he looked  very stem, and told him he would think of it. In fact he  called his council together, and expressed his extreme vex-  ation at having promised this young ambassador to return  all he had won from his master ; that he had considered the  conditions he had attached thereunto were impossible to be  accomplished, and quite sufficient to prevent his compliance.  The Princess, his daughter, who was one of the most lovely  creatures in the world, having heard him speak thus, said,  " You are aware, Sire, that up to the present moment I have  beaten all those who have dared to dispute the prize in a race  with me. You must tell the ambassador that if he can  reach before me a certain spot that shall be marked out, you  will no longer hesitate to keep your word with him." The  Emperor embraced his child, thought her advice admirable,  and the next morning received Fortune very graciously.</paragraph>

The King renewed his intercessions, but they only  served to exasperate her. At length, the day fixed for this  terrible execution arrived. They came to lead the Chevalier  rom the prison in which they had placed him, and where he  had been living without a single person in the world to speak  to. He was therefore ignorant of what crime the Queen had  accused him, and merely imagined it some new persecution  his indifference to her had brought upon him; and that  which distressed him the most was, that he believed the  .King participated with the Princess in her rage against him.  Horide, inconsolable at seeing the situation in which her lover  was placed, took a most violent resolution, which was to poison  the Queen and herself if Fortun6 should be doomed to a cruel  death. From the moment she knew the sentence, despair  seized her; she thought but of how to put her intentions  into effect. The poison she procured, however, was not as  powerful as she desired, for although she had given it to the  Queen, that Princtas, not feeling the effects of it, caused the  charming Cheralier to be brought into the great square of  the palace, that the execution might take plafe in her pre-  -aenoe. The exeoutioners brought him from his dimgeon  Aocoiding to their custom, and led him like a tender kmb  to the alaiighter.

He dared not follow her, great as was his anxiety  to renew the couversatiou. He flung himself upon the spot  she had just quitted, and after recalling to his memory the  verses he had heard her sing, he wrote them down in his  tablets, and examined them carefully.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='4979'>He was immediately permitted to mix with the rural com-  pany. He was very gallant, and easily succeeded in making  himself agreeable to the shepherdesses generally ; but with  regard to Constancia, he found she possessed a spirit so fox  above what she appeared to be, that he could not reconcile  the existence of so much beauty, wit, and merit with the rude  and countiy life she led. It was in vain he followed her ; he  always found her alone in the depths of the forest, singing  abstractedly. He observed no shepherd venture to attempt  to please her; it seemed to be too difficult a task. Mirtain  made that great attempt himself; he courted her assiduously,  and learned from his own experience that she declined form-  ing any engagement. Every evening he reported to the  Prince the state of affairs; all the information he gave him  had only the effect of distracting him. "Do not deceive  yourself, my Lord," said Mirtain one day to him ; " if this  beautiful girl does love, it must be some one in her own  country." " If that were the case," said the Prince, " would  she not return to it 1" " How do we know," rejoined Mirtain,  "" that she has not some reasons which prevent her returning  to her native landl She may have quarrelled with her  lover." " Alas 1 " exclaimed the Prince, " she sang with too  much tenderness the words I heard." " It is a fact," con-  tinued Mirtain, "that all the trees are covered with the  initials of their names ; and as no one seems to please her in  these parts, some one undoubtedly must have done so else-  -where."

" No, no," said the Queen, " I give  it yoU;fbr your trouble; do not omit to wear it : but, tell me,  what did you see on your road?" " I saw," she replied,  " some elephants, who were so intelligent, and displayed so  miueh ingenuity, that there is not a country in tiie world  where they would not excite admiration. It seems that forest  is their kingdom, and that there are in it some that rule the  rest." The Queen was greatly mortified, and did not say all  she thought, but she was still in hopes that nothing on  eajiih would prevent the girdle from burning the Princess.  " Though the elephants have spared thee," she muttered to  herself, " the girdle will avenge me !

Constancio," said she, "you will  shortly receive sad tidings of me. You ought not to have  gone and abandoned me to the fury of your mother !  ^you  might have protected me, or you would have received my  last sigh in lieu of my being delivered over to her tyrannical  power, and bereft of every consolation ! " She went to her  work in the garden at day-break as usual ; she found in it  still a thousand venomous reptiles, from which, however, her  ring preserved her. She had put on the blue velvet girdle,  and when the Queen saw her gathering flowers as calmly as  if she had only a thread round her waist; nothing had ever  equalled her vexation. "What mysterious power interests  itself for this shepherdess ! " cried she ; " she bewitches my  son by her beauty, and restores him to^ health by the appli-  cation of innocent simples. Snakes and asps crawl at her  feet without stinging her. The wild elephants become gentle  and kind at her sight. The fairy-girdle, which should have  reduced her to ashes, serves but to adorn her. I must have  recourse, then, to more certain remedies."</paragraph>

In vain she assured them that Prince Gonstancio would ran-  som her with all he possessed in the world; the more she  convinced them of the value he set upon her, the greater was  the speed they made in the fear that he would be informed of  her abduction, and that he would overtake and snatch from  them their prey. At length, after having sailed half over  the globe, they encountered a terrific storm: the PrinceBB,  overwhelmed by her grie^ and the effects of her voyage, was  almost dying. They feared they should lose her, and Uxk  refuge in the nearest port; but as they were landing they  saw approaching them, a Giant of the most tremendous size.  He was followed by several others, who all cried out in a  breath, that they wanted to see what curiosities were on board  the ship. The first thing that struck the giant"s si^t^ on  stepping aboard, was the young Princess. They knew each  other again immediately. * Hah ! little wretch," exclaimed  the monster, * the just and merciful gods have placed thee  again in my power! Dost thou remember the day I found  thee, and that thou didst cut open my sack ? I am much  mistaken if thou playest me such a trick this time." So  saying, he pounced on her as an eagle would on a chicken,  and, despite the resistance and entreaties of the merchants,  carried her off in his arms, running as fast as he could to his  great tower. This tower is on a high mountain. The En-  chanters, who built it, have neglected nothing that could  make it beautiful and curious. It has no door ; it is entered  by the windows, which are placed very high ; the walls are  of diamonds, which sparkle like the sun, and are impervious  to any force. In short, all that art and nature combined  could display of splendour, is outshone by what is to be seen  there.

I prefer passing one hour where you  are to all the grandeur you desire for me." When she made  a similar speech to her brothers, they answered frankly that  they should be delighted, and when to prove them she added,  ""Yes, I would that ye sat on the highest thrones in the  world, though I should never see ye more." They imme-  diately answered, " You are right, sister, it would be well worth  the sacrifice." " You would consent then, in that case," said  she, " not to see me again?"

It was then  that love, disguised under the specious form of natural affec-  tion, established itself in these young hearts. At fourteen,  Belle-Etoile began to reproach herself with the injustice she  felt she was doing her brothers by not loving them all equally  welL She imagined that the attentions and caresses of Cheri  were the cause of it. She forbade him to seek more oppor-  tunities of pleasing her, " You have already found but too  many," said she to him graciously; "and you have suc-  ceeded in causing me to make a great difference between our  brothers and yourself."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='5317'>They were as yet ignorant both of the extent and of the  nature of their affection, when one day some new books were  brought to Belle-Etoile. She took up the first that came to  hand. It was the history of two young lovers, whose passion  had commenced whilst they considered themselves brother  and sister. They had afterwards been discovered by their  families, and eventually, after passing through infinite troubles,  espoused each other.^ As Cheri read remarkably well, and not  only understood what he read, but had the faculty of convey-  ing the full sense of it to others, the Princess requested him  to read to her, while she finished some work in flock-silk  which she was anxious to complete. He read, therefore, the  above story, and it was not without much emotion that he  discovered in it a perfect description of all his feelings. Belle-  Etoile was not less surprised. It seemed as though the author  had read all that was passing in her soul. The more Cheri  read the more he was agitated. The more the Princess  listened, the more was she affected. Despite of all her efforts  her eyes filled with tears, and they ran down her cheeks.  Cheri, also, struggled in vain against his feelings. He turned  pale, his voice faltered. Each of them suffered all that can  be imagined under such circumstances. "Ah, sister," he  exclaimed, gazing on her sadly and dropping the book, " how  happy was Hippolyte in not being the brother of Julie !

As it  sailed out of port, Cleopatra, with her Antony, and even the  whole crew of Venus"s Galley, would have lowered their flag  to it.

" Ah ! what should  I have done," continued Belle-Etoile, " if they had brought  me my dear brother, dead or dying?" "He should not go  any more," said the old woman ; "the others ought to oblige  you in their turn, and the enterprise is not so dangerous."

" Ah ! my  Xiord," replied the stranger, " you are not aware, then, of the  dangers attending the undertaking; here is a book that men-  tions it ; it makes one tremble to read it." " No matter for  that," saidCheri, "the danger will not dismay me,  only inform  me where I shall find it." "This book indicates," continued the  young man, " that it is in a vast desert in Lybia ; that one can  hear it sing eight leagues off; and that the dragon, which guards  it, has already devoured five hundred thousand persons, who  have had the temerity to go there." " I shall make the number  five hundred thousand and one," replied the Prince smiling;  and saluting him, set forward towards the deserts of Lybia ;  his fine horse, which was of the Zephyrine race, for Zephyr  was his grandsire, went like the wind ; so that the Prince"s  progress was incredibly swift. He listened in vain; he could  not hear the singing of the apple anywhere ; he was distressed  at the length of the way and the inutility of his journey,  when he perceived a poor tiu:tle-dove fell at his feet ; it was  not dead, but very nearly so. As he saw no one who could  have wounded it, he thought, perhaps, it belonged to Venus,  and having escaped from its dovecot, little mischievous Love,  to try his arrows, had let fly at it.

"I am persuaded," said dhe, "that  nothing else hat the apple could be so melodious ; for it  plays all the different parts of music of itself, and without  touching any instrumeut, it appears to perform on them in  a most enchanting manner," They approached nearer to it.

He  had smelt the Prince from afar off, and expected to devour  him, as he had every one who had preceded him, and upon  -whom he had made some excellent meals. Their bones were  piled around the apple-tree, upon which was the beautiful  apple, and they were heaped up so high, that it was not  possible to see it.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='5465'>The frightful animal came bounding along, covering the  ground with a froth which was very poisonous: out of his  infernal throat issued fire, and young dragons, which he  hurled like darts in the eyes and ears of the knights-errants  who wished to carry away the apple. But when he saw his  alarming figure multiplied a hundred and a hundred times in  the Prince"s mirrors, it was he that was frightened in his turn.  He stopped, and looking fiercely at the Prince laden with  dragons, he took flight. Cheri, perceiving the happy effect  of his armour, pursued him to the entrance of a deep chasm,  into which the monster precipitated himself to avoid him.  The Prince closed up the aperture securely, and returned  with all speed to the singing apple. After mounting upon  the top of all the bones that surrounded it, he looked with  admiration upon the beautiful tree; it was of amber, the  apples being topazes, and the most beautiful of all, which he  sought so carefully and at so much peril, appeared at the top,  composed of a single ruby, with a crown of diamonds upon it.  The Prince, transported with joy at being able to give Belle-  Etoile so perfect and rare a treasure, quickly broke the  amber branch, and, quite proud of his good fortune, mounted  his white horse ; but he could nowhere see the Dove,  she  had flown away as soon as there was no further need of her  assistance.

The King,  "who loved him dearly, was as much delighted at this occur-  rence as the Queen-Mother was displeased to hear the applause  that was bestowed upon the Princes. After silence was re-  stored, Belle-Etoile placed the singing apple upon the water;  it was made out of a single ruby, surrounded by diamonds,  with a branch of amber; it commenced so harmonious a  concert, that a hundred musicians would have been less  effectiYe. This enchanted the King and all his Court, whose  admiration increased when Belle-Etoile drew from her muff  a little golden cage, of beautiful workmanship, in which was  the green bird that told everything ; it was fed upon diamond  dust, and drank only the water from distilled pearls. She  took it very gently and placed it on the apple, which was  silent out of respect, and to give the bird the opportunity  of talking ; its feathers were so beautifully delicate, that they  were ruffled by people even shutting and opening their eyes  near it They were of all the shades of green that could be  imagined. The bird addressed itself to the King, and asked  him what he would like to know 1 " We should like to learn,"  said the King, "who this beautiful girl and these three cavaliers  arel" "Oh, King," answered the green bird, with a loud  and intelligible voice ; " she is thy daughter, and two of these  princes are thy sons, the third, called Cheri, is thy nephew;"  and it then related with wonderful eloquence the whole his-  tory, without omitting the least circumstance. The King  wept, and the afflicted Queen, who had quitted the cauldron,  the bones, and the dogs, approached gently, weeping for joy  and love for her husband and her children ; for could she doubt  the truth of this statement, when she perceived all the tokens  by which they could be recognised.

In this  very first story the effects of Madame d"Aulnoy"s residence at  the court of Madrid is to be seen.

The Queen, she tells us, rode on a fine Andalusian horse,  which the Marquis de Villa Mayna, her first gentleman-usher,  led by the reins. Her clothes were so richly embroidered  that you could not see the stuff they were made of. Shd  wore a hat trimmed with white and scarlet feathers, and the  pearl called the Peregrina,^ which is as big as a small pear,  and of inestimable value, hanging from the agraffe of dia-  monds which looped up her hat. Her hair hung loose upon  her shoulders and forehead : her neck was a little bare, and  she wore a farthingale.

The Queen, sleeping one day in a garden, dreams  that three feiries appear in the air above her head, and, ex-  pressing their concern for her, determine that she shall have  a son, whom the first two endow with all the graces of form,  feature, and intellect. The third, however, merely laughs  and mutters some words between her teeth, which are not  iiit^gible to the Queen. She wakes, sees no one, returns to  the palace in great agitation, and reveals her dream to the  King, expressing her alarm at the intentions of the third fairy.  In due time, the promised heir to the throne makes his appear-  ance ; but, instead of a beautiful boy, he is a horrible wild  boar-pig, called in French, Marcassin, The terrible misfor-  tune is concealed for some time from the Queen; but when  they are compelled to tell her the truth, her distress is, of  course, overwhelming. She, however, resists the King"s pro-  posal to destroy the little monster, and by degrees becomes  attached to it. Prince Marcassin, as he is named, grows up,  and exhibits considerable capacity and courage ; but has  much of the ferocity, as well as all the appearance, of a  wild-boar. His manners and dress are descvibed with soma  humour. A lady of quality, reduced in circumstances, ai^-  plies to the Queen for protection for laexefcYl ^.xA "^^^^ ^Vx:&lt;</paragraph>

The wedding takes  place, and oa the bridal night Marcossin sees lament ani  CoridoQ fall by their own hands. He has scarcely recovered  &amp;om the shock of this catastrophe, when he iaik in love ^th  the seooad daughter, Zdonide, who ia also conapelled to  marry him, but determines to destroy him by strangling him  when he is asleep. He diacoveja her intention, and kills her  with two blows of his tenifio tusks. Disgusted with tha  world, aud also with himself, he flics from the palace, sud  lives in the woods witb otber wild boars. One day he en-  counters by accident Maithesie, the third sister, and proposes  to her. She is not so much startled by the offer as the reader  may imagine ; she aska only for time for consideration.  Another meeting takes place, and she ia persuaded to vmi  his oavem, under a promise ta be allowed to leave it again,  which he breaks, and inakea her first his prisonor, and then  his wife.

This whimsical event is followed hy  a voice declaring t^t Marcaasin and Uarthesie shall be made  happy, if they can guess what the distafis signify. Marcaasin  guesses that the three white distafb are the three Fairies, and  Marthesie divines that the three black are her two sisters and  Condon, The conjectures prove correct  the transformations  take place.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='5689'>^ This story details the adventures of an exceedingly ugly  prince named Alidor, who, travelling in disguise, falls in love  with a beautiful princess named Livorette, and by the assist-  ance of a dolphin, the life of which he preserves while fishing,  acquires the power of assuming at pleasure the form of  a canary-bird. Under this form he becomes a feivourite with  Livorette, who had laughed at his attentions as Alidor. A  mock marriage with the canary-bird leads to a real scandal  through the instrumentality of a spiteful feiry accidentally  offended by Alidor ; and the prince, his wife, and infant are  thrown into the sea in a tub by order of the infuriated father  of Livorette, and are only saved from destruction by the  intervention of the friendly dolphin, who conveys them to his  own island, and ultimately restores the princess to the arms  of her relenting parents, and Alidor to the crown of his father.  There is nothing in the purport of the story to cause the  reader to regret, while there is sufficient in its details to  justify its omission.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='59'>This assertion may appear startling to those who are  familiar with many English versions of the most popular  of them ; but it is, nevertheless, a fact, as the examina-  tion of this little volume will prove.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='60'>Early in the last century, three volumes of Fairy  Tales were published, under the title of " A Collection  of Novels and Tales of the Fairies, written by that cele-  brated wit of France, the Countess d\"Anois, translated  from the best edition of the original French, by several  hands." And in 1817 the same collection reappeared in  two small volumes, with a new preface, and entitled,  " Fairy Tales, translated from the French of the Coun-  tess d\"Anois." Now, it will scarcely be believed that,  although the collectors introduced the novels which link  the second series of her Fairy Tales together, after the  fashion of the old Italian novelists, they not only omitted  the whole of the first series, but also several of the b  of the second ; substituting, in the place o? \\\\ve. \\^.^</paragraph>

"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='64'>Nor was the injustice to the author limited to this  singular caprice. The tales, instead of being faithfully  translated, were recklessly abridged and loosely para-  phrased ; while the incidental couplets occasionally, and  the versified morals invariably, were dispensed with  altogether.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='65'>Other abridgments and paraphrases of a few of these  stories have appeared in sundry juvenile publications ;  and, in a very recent one, the rising generation was pre-  sented with " Babiole,\"^ " Princess Rosette,^^ " Princess  Printaniere^\" (called "Princess Maia"), " The Beneficent  Frog," and " The Good Little Mouse ;" but still abridged,  and adapted to the atmosphere of the nursery. I beg to  disclaim any intention of depreciating these latter pro-  ductions, which are avowedly addressed to the youngest  class of readers ; but the first was a literary fraud, which  cannot be too severely denounced, whether it be regarded  as an imposition on the public or an injustice to the  original author. And yet the writer of the Preface to the  fifth edition (<entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='writer;preface;edition' adjectives='' verbs='say;pretend'>London</entity>, 1766) says, " I shall not pretend</paragraph>

The  omissions consist of, first, the Novels with which the  second series of her Fairy Tales, entitled, " Les F^es  ^ la Mode," were interlarded, possessing little interest  in themselves, and unnecessary as vehicles for the  sprightly and ingenious stories they introduce; and,  secondly, of the two concluding tales, " Prince Mar-  cassin," and " <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='omission;series;fairy;tale;les;f;e;mode;interest;vehicle;story;tale;prince;cassin;merit;humour;alteiatioius;tl;^;ckkvx' adjectives='little;unnecessary;sprightly;ingenious;fancy;considerable' verbs='consist;entitle;be;interlard;possess;introduce;conclude;want;be;concern;^'>Le Dauphin</entity>," which, though not wanting  in merit, as far as fancy and humour are concerned,  could not, without considerable alteiatioii^ \\tl ^)ckKvx</paragraph>

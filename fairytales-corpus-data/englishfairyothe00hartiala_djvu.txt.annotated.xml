	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='73'>The following collection of English Folk Tales docs  not pretend to be more than a presentation, in a more  or less literary form, of a few of the traditional stories,  formerly no doubt rife in this country, but now fast  disappearing under the stress of modem life. The  reader will of course miss many of those with which  he has always been familiar  many for which the  term Fairy Tale has always seemed to him to have a  special connotation. One of the reasons for this is  that several of such tales are not of true native  growth, but were introduced from France by means  of the chap-book translations to which I shall have  occasion to refer presently. Another reason is to be  found in the complaint recently made by a distin-  guished writer that a good version of his old favourite,  Jack the Giant-Killer, was hard to procure. I have  indeed ventured to include a version of this particular  tale, though it can by no means be denied that time  and circumstances have dealt hardly with it, as with  many like it The story bears marks of the weathering</paragraph>

Nay, even many  of its outlines are broken and destroyed : it is but a  poor maimed thing, and, what is worse, it is by no  means solitary in its ruin.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>This blurring of detail and destruction of outline,  moreover, only repeats within the limits of the indi-  vidual story what has been going on with every class  of traditions. Whole stories have disappeared, and  are disappearing from day to day. In England and  in Scotland we have perhaps managed to keep speci-  mens of every kind of traditional narrative ; but from  Wales one entire class  and that one of the most  important  has vanished utterly. The different fates  of English and Welsh folk tales lead us so far beyond  commonplace generalities about the decay of tradition,  that I am tempted to spend a few words upon them.  In doing so it will be needful first of all to explain  that Tales or Traditional Narratives are capable of  being divided into at least five classes  namely,  Sagas, Nursery Tales, Drolls, Apologues, and Cumu-  lative Tales. Beast Tales may perhaps be added as  a sixth class ; but most of the examples can be  assigned places in one or other of the classes pre-  viously named. I will not trouble the reader with a  definition of all these classes : it is only necessary for  my purpose to explain the first two.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>A Saga is a traditional narrative which is believed  to be true, and which relates to some definite human  person who is held to have really lived, or to some  definite locality, or to the power and deeds of some  deity or other supernatural being or race of beings.  Frequently the human person, the definite locality,  and the supernatural beings are all brought together  into one Saga ; more usually two only of these  elements. But in any case it is essential that the  people by or among whom the story is told should  have faith in the veritable occurrence of the events  related. A Nursery Tale, or Mdrchen (to use the  simpler German name), on the other hand, is not  believed as an actual narrative of fact. Its hero is  quite unknown to history : its scene is not laid at any  special place or period. " Once up6n a time, in a  certain town or village," is a sufficient description of  place and period for the obscure son of a nameless  poor widow. Occasionally, it is true, names are fitted  to persons and localities. But they are selected at  random ; and we hear of Scotland, Norway, France,  or Spain, and their kings, not because it is intended  to make any assertion concerning those realms and  their monarchs to which our credence is asked, but  simply to assist the imagination in following the  flight of the tale. A Nursery Tale is, like a Saga, a  narrative which, for want of a better word, and as  opposed to Drolls, or comic tales, we must call</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>A considerable number of English and Welsh folk  tales have been collected and written down. But  whereas Nursery Tales, or Mdrchen, form a large  proportion of the stories found in other countries,  those recorded in England are very few, while it  is a remarkable fact that not a single mdrchen has  been discovered in Wales. By far the greatest  number of English and Welsh stories are Sagas.  The connection between Sagas and Nursery Tales is  very close, in spite of the substantial distinction laid  down above. Indeed, so nearly are they related that  the same story is frequently told in one place as a  Saga about a well-known man, or locality, and in  another as a Nursery Tale, without any greater claim  upon belief as an account of actual events than the  fable of the Fox and the Grapes. Many of the  mdrchen of foreign nations assume in this country  the form of sagas. What the exact relationship is  between these two classes of stories has not yet been  determined. Did all these traditional narratives exist  first as Sagas ? and did men in the process of time,  and in the course of their tribal wanderings, forget  the persons and the periods and the places to which  properly belonged the incidents they remembered,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>INTRODUCTION. xi</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>and continue to relate those incidents apart from  the names and other particulars ? Or were Nursery  Tales the first slow growths of human fancy ? and  after they had been floating about on the waves of  speech for awhile, did they one after another anchor  themselves at different spots and upon various human  and superhuman personalities, and thus obtain more  or less credit as facts ? Or again, are Sagas and  Mdrchen independent, but similar, growths, assuming  the one form in one set of circumstances, and the  other in a different set? The present state of our  knowledge does not admit of a definite answer to  these questions. Their solution, if it is ever to be  attained, must be wrought out in detail by tracing the  history of each story separately. But the determina-  tion of the relations of Saga and Mdrchen is not  necessary for the consideration of the present prob-  lem ; for in any case it is quite clear that both kinds  of tradition are of immemorial antiquity. Not only  do we find them both fully developed among distant  savages, such as the Hottentots and the American  Indians, whose grade of civilisation the Aryan races  had passed and left behind long ere the dawn of his-  tory, but the ancient Egyptians have bequeathed to  us stories of the same kind in manuscripts computed  by scholars to be at least five thousand years old.  And it is quite inconceivable that the Welsh alone of  all the earth were destitute of nursery tales. Moreover,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>the form and incidents of more than one of the  famous Mabinogion in the Red Book of Hergest are  such as to render it highly probable that they have  been evolved from miirchen. It is equally inconceiv-  able that the Anglo-Saxon race, which produced  Beowulf, the Robin Hood ballads, and Chevy Chase,  to say nothing of the masterpieces of imaginative litera-  ture whose authors we know, should have been poor  in those stories which earliest feed the fancy of the  child. Why then have these mdrchen disappeared ?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>We can only reply by conjecture. But it must be  observed, in the first place, that sagas, by their very  nature as pretending to record actual events, have a  greater chance of life than stories told only for  amusement, and that chiefly the amusement of  children. Grown-up men and women forget the  latter, or become ashamed of them, and try to believe  that they have forgotten them, while they still accept  and gravely repeat the former. These they tell to  travellers, who write them down for the information  of more advanced or more inquisitive peoples.  Credulous chroniclers weave them into their narra-  tives as authentic history. Preachers discourse on  them at large ; and moralists, or simply gossiping  writers of anecdotes, use them to illustrate some  laboured theme, or drag them in for their very  strangeness. In all these ways English and Welsh  sagas have become preserved in the amber of litera-</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>ture ; and poets, enraptured with their beauty, have  rendered many of them imperishable as the mind of  man. But to the nursery tale, as such, these avenues  of transmission are closed. The continuance of its  existence depends upon its popularity with successive  generations of mothers and children. If anything  occur to diminish or destroy its popularity, it fades  out of memory and is no more. True, its separate  incidents, or the more striking of them, may retain  an independent life by virtue of their hold on the  collective imagination of the race. They may be  taken up into sagas, or even into other mdrcheny or  transformed into drolls; but the tale of which they  originally were part vanishes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>Now, could we suppose that by some means a  whole cycle of nursery tales should lose its popularity  and thus be lost, we should have exactly the state of  things we actually find in Wales, and to a somewhat  less extent in England, and perhaps the Lowlands of  Scotland. Every other European country possesses  an ample store of these narratives ; but few have  been recorded in the Scottish Lowlands, fewer still in  England, and none at all in Wales. It may of course be  said that they have not been sought for. Because they  are mostly recounted for the enjoyment of children,  who, as they advance in years, outgrow the infantine  condition of thought which delights in them, they are  less easy of collection.

Although he may  find persons willing to communicate their traditional  lore, he will not easily make them understand that he  can attach any importance to nursery tales, and when  he succeeds in doing this his story-tellers will simply  suppose that he wants to hear them in order to turn  them into ridicule, and will consequently pretend not  to know any. It requires, therefore, much patience  to extract them, and frequently they are only  discovered by accident. Yet, when all this is taken  into account, if the Welsh have any mdrclten remain-  ing, it is at least odd that none of them have been  recorded. We are accordingly driven upon the  supposition that they are lost ; and in looking for a  cause we must not omit from our consideration tlie  partial loss of similar traditions among the English  and Scotch. If we can find a cause sufficiently strong  common to all three nations, and not operating, or  not operating with anything like the same power,  among the other European peoples, we shall prob-  ably be right in assigning that as the true cause.  This is an historical enquiry which cannot be more  than summarised here.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='104'>u"A reason which would occur to most readers is  the spread of education, Scotland, since the days of  John Knox, has been covered with a noble network  of schools, wherein Scottish boys at all events have got  the rudiments of literary learning. In England, not-  withstanding many valuable foundations, education,  even of an elementary kind, has been greatly restricted  until the last few years. Yet throughout the country  such knowledge as existed among the unlettered  classes has been effectual to the destruction of most  of the native mdrchen in a somewhat curious manner.  Perrault"s tales, which achieved in France a popularity  so sudden and complete at the end of the seventeenth  century, were translated into English, and speedily  appeared in the form of chap-books with gaudy  covers and coarse woodcuts. These were dissem-  inated far and wide ; and Cinderella, Bluebeard, and  the rest we know so well, like the young cuckoo in a  sparrow"s nest, seem to have ousted the proper brood.  But in Wales the difference of tongue would have  prevented the irruption of these foreign stories.  Schools were not absolutely non-existent, but they  were very few and poor ; and we cannot lay to their  charge the loss of nursery tales. It must be due,  therefore, to some other cause, much wider, much  more powerful. I find such a cause in the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cause;principality' adjectives='such;cal' verbs='find;have;prevail'>Evangeli</entity>-  cal Protestantism which has so largely prevailed,  not only in the Principality, but also in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='cause;principality' adjectives='such;cal' verbs='find;have;prevail'>Scotland</entity> and "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='107'>u"England. Sternly monotheistic, its heroes, and they  have been many, have never been exalted into demi-  gods, like the saints of the mediaeval Church. Severer  in its repression of much of the gaiety of life than  any other religion influential in Europe, it has  frowned upon all imagination except that of a strictly  theological cast ; and it has substituted for the idle  tales of tradition the more edifying and veracious  histories of Noah, Jacob, and Samson. This is a  process which has been going on in England and  Scotland since the Reformation. In the latter  kingdom it was perhaps weakened by the cessation  of active religious propagandism down to the early  years of the present century, owing to the almost  entire absence of Nonconformity. In England, where  Nonconformity has always existed, the process has  been continuously more or less active, and doubtless  under its influence the obliteration of mdrchen from  the popular memory had already begun before the  introduction of the translations from Perrault"s work.  Since the Act of Uniformity, Wales, too, has never  been without Nonconformists; but, especially in  North Wales, their numbers were insignificant until  the rise of Methodism under the preaching of Howel  Harries and his coadjutors. At that time a religious  revival similar to, but proportionately much greater  than, that which was taking place in England  shook the Principality from end to end. It had an "</paragraph>

It is no exaggeration to say  that the whole current of a nation"s thoughts was  changed. Sermons were substituted for football, and  religious meetings for drunken bouta Those who  could read read the Bible to their neighbours ;  spiritual concerns drew men together and formed the  staple subject of their talk. Nor was this a passing  phasa The clergy, a great number of whom, intruded  into their cures from England, were utterly ignorant  of the language, cared not for the salvation of souls.  Their duties were performed in the most perfunctory  manner ; and they gladly escaped from the pulpit to  *^"the alehouse, from sacred rite to rustic sport Harries,  Williams, and Rowlands, the fathers of the Welsh  Methodist revival, were men of another type. Sab-  bath-breaking, drunkenness, and swearing they could  not away with ; and dancing and the village games  seemed scarcely less evil to them, in the face of the  awful realities of life and death. They could not  afford to let their converts slip back into these  sinful practices ; and they accordingly formed them  everywhere into societies whose moral code, as well  as their orthodoxy, was of the narrowest and  most rigid description. Their teaching and example  quickened the faltering faith of kindred religious  bodies, and assured the overwhelming predominance "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>of Protestant Nonconformity. In England, Whit-  field, Wesley, and the other leaders of the evangelical  movement were actuated by the same lofty motives  and pursued the same policy, though with more  partial success. The general result was beyond  all question beneficial. Apart from the effect for  which these earnest men looked and prayed  namely,  the salvation of souls  civilisation made a great  stride. Open immorality was suppressed ; brutalising  sports, such as cock-fighting, and other sorts of  ruffianism, were discountenanced. Men began to  have ideals of which not physical, but moral and  spiritual, force was the distinctive mark.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>In such a movement it was inevitable that many  of the old popular traditions should be crushed.  The heart of the movement was the Bible ; and the  enthusiasm of the early Christians against classic  heathenism seemed to be revived and directed against  everything which did not savour of the Bible and  things divine. The ignoranct which had hitherto  enwrapped the peasantry began to be lifted ; but the  light that fell upon them was only that of theological  speculation and Scripture narrative. A careful quest  among the writings of the Fathers of Methodism   perhaps of other Dissenters  would probably reveal  condemnation repeatedly directed against lewd songs  and " old wives\" fables," The tendency at any rate  of their teaching is unmistakable. But we must not</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='117'>u"forget that they themselves were extremely cre-  dulous. John Wesley"s diary teems with ghost  stories, stories of miraculous interpositions of Pro-  vidence, and so forth, in all of which he placed the  most implicit faith. His fellow-workers, both in  England and Wales, were to the full as trustful.  Hence they would readily accept soma sorts of folk-  tales. Nay, the imagination would be quickened  in certain directions under the influence of powerful  religious emotion ; and sagas of corpse-candles and  of evil spirits, whether ghost or devil, would become  doubly dreadful. But stories untouched by the  prevailing impulse, or which afforded no arguments  in favour of a preacher"s doctrine, would naturally  recede from view and be lost ; while if any were  condemned as idle or sinful they would cease to be  repeated by those who attached any importance to  the condemnation. Now, nursery tales are treasured  chiefly by women, for to their lot it usually falls to  narrate them to their little charges. But women are  peculiarly susceptible to religious feelings; and if such  stories were obnoxious to those whom they were  accustomed to reverence as spiritual guides, there can  be little doubt what the result would be.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>they might be modified in course of time. Within  my own knowledge, however, and doubtless within  the recollection of many of my readers, in England  the narration of nursery tales to children has been  discouraged, and, in some cases, forbidden, for reasons  in no wise diflfering from those I have indicated.  This is a subject on which no statistics can be made  available ; but I suspect that these objections to  mdrchen have been very widespread. And they have  been unquestionably reinforced by the discoveries of  the past century in physical science and by the  popularisation of knowledge. For many years the  voice of well-meaning persons has been heard in the  land exhorting mothers to feed their babes on the  milk of science and the bread of fact, and not to fill  young minds with fairy tales which are not true and  can do no good to them. It is a matter of thankful-  ness that these tedious beings are no longer listened  to as they were a generation ago, and that they  scarcely penetrated into Wales or into the remote  country districts of England and Scotland. Children  there were always bred up on stories from the Bible  and sagas of elves and goblins, ghosts and corpse-  candles. Facts such as these (and they were all  looked upon as equally authentic) cultivated the  imagination, and thus preserved for us many precious  fragments of old-world thought.</paragraph>

A collection like the  present, though it aims to be representative, may  perhaps be found to contain a proportion of sagas  great even beyond the proportion of such tales actu-  ally extant For not only does its plan exclude the  familiar adaptations of nursery tales from Perrault  and other French collections, but sagas are in them-  selves of greater interest than any other class of  folktales except mdrchen, and are therefore more  frequently the subjects of literary reproduction.  Probably, however, none but scientific students will  be concerned with the disproportion here hinted at;  and, after all, it may be replied that this volume is  not intended  mainly, at all events  for them. It  is addressed rather to readers whose interest has yet  to be enlisted in the fairy tales of science  of that  science which is the Science of Fairy Tales. For such  readers a few of the traditions of their fatherland may  perhaps be found a not inappropriate introduction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>That which is chiefly interesting in all these stories  is the question of their real origin and meaning. There  are some readers who, though not scientific students,  cannot be satisfied without some sort of an explana-  tion, some " philosophy," as they are pleased to term  it, of the stories. To such I might recommend the  plan adopted by several of the philosophers of  antiquity, and weighted amongst moderns by the</paragraph>

It is also the plan of the monkish  compilers of the Gesta Romanorum, who fitted their  stories with long-winded "applications," as if they  were expositions of moral and theological truth,  veiled by parable. The advantage of this mode of  exposition is that you are not at all concerned with  what the people who first told the story meant, or  how they came to tell it All that need be done is  to consider how you can exhibit your own ingenuity  by reading into the tale any meaning  preferably  an ethical one  that may happen to suit your taste.  Those who have the privilege of listening to the  sermons of some theologians know the process.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>Theorists like Professor Max Miiller and his dis-  ciples cannot be put on even terms with clever people  of this kind, because they profess to tell just what the  others do not trouble about  namely, the origin and  true meaning of these tales. It does, however, seem  a pity they should hamper themselves by assuming  such a regard for facts. For in truth they have a  fine imagination, and it would be difficult to find  in recent English literature more picturesque, more  glowing passages than ajre to be met with in descrip-  tions of the sun-hero or the dawn-maiden and their  various adventures, as seen through the spectacles  of the Aryan philologists.</paragraph>

That is what  real students of folk-lore are doing. Discarding  ethical and literary prejudices, they strive first of all  to track custom, superstition, tale, or song back to its  earliest form and to discover its analogues wherever  they can find them. Next, they inquire what inter-  pretation, if any, do the people among whom the  custom, the superstition, the tale, or the song is rife  put on it ; what is their habit of thought, degree of  civilisation, previous history ; and what can we learn  by comparing the customs, superstitions, etc., of  nations in a similar condition. In these inquiries  special stress is laid on the principle that Tradition is  one and indivisible. Custom cannot be studied apart  from superstition, nor superstition from tale or song.  All are inseparably connected, for all go to form one  whole, which is the general body of culture possessed  by a nation, or, as it may happen, by a given class  within a nation. No doubt this is very laborious,  very dry perchance, when contrasted with the methods  expounded in The Wisdom, of tJie Ancients and The  Mythology of the Aryan Nations.

We are learning gradually  what kind of men our forefathers were, how they  really looked at the world, what was their social  and economic organisation, what were their religious  beliefs, and in what manner all these have been  gradually modified and developed, or else have  dwindled and decayed, down to the present  time. The fairy tales now presented to the reader  are survivals from a period when the supernatural  beings therein depicted, and the wonderful powers  wielded either by them or by mortals, were a vital  part of the belief, and exercised daily and hourly  influence on the sayings and doings, of everybody   even as similar creeds do on the barbarous tribes in  every quarter of the globe to-day. They were part  and parcel of a social and intellectual condition which  has passed, or is rapidly passing, away everywhere.  But behind this social and intellectual condition our  inquiries are leading us to the psychological problems  involved. Why did men believe in witchcraft and  totems, fairies and giants, gods and devils? Why  did they practise animal, and even human sacrifice,  the couvade, infant baptism, initiatory rites on attain-  ing manhood ? What is the meaning of their funeral  ceremonies? of their marriage laws? of the extra-  ordinary variety of regulations affecting social inter-  course?

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='157'>u"In the reign of King Arthur, there Uved in the county  of Cornwall, near the Land"s End of England, a  wealthy farmer who had one only son called Jack. He  was brisk and of a ready lively wit, so that whatever he  could not perform by force and strength he completed  by ingenious wit and policy. Never was any person heard  of that could worst him, and he very often even baffled the  learned by his sharp and ready invention. "</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='158'>u"In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge  and monstrous giant of eighteen feet in height, and about  three yards in compass, of a fierce and grim countenance,  the terror of all the neighbouring towns and villages.  He lived in a cave in the midst of the Mount, and  would not suffer any one else to live near him. His  food was other men"s cattle, which often became  his prey, for whensoever he wanted food he would wade "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='162'>over to the main-land, where he would furnish himself  with whatever came in his way. The good folk, at his  approach, forsook their habitations, while he seized on their  cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his  back at a time ; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would  tie them round his waist like a bunch of bandeleirs. This  course he had followed for many years, so that all <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;depredation' adjectives='many' verbs='have;follow;be;impoverish'>Cornwall</entity>  was impoverished by his depredations.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='163'>One day Jack, happening to be present at the town hall  when the magistrates were sitting in council about the  giant, asked what reward would be given to the person  who destroyed him. The giant\"s treasure, they said, was the  recompense. Quoth <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='quoth' adjectives='' verbs='let;undertake'>Jack</entity>, " Then let me undertake it"</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='164'>So he furnished himself with a horn, shovel, and  pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in the beginning  of a dark winter\"s evening, when he fell to work, and  before morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep, and  nearly as broad, covering it over with long sticks and straw.  Then strewing a little mould upon it, it appeared like plain  ground. This completed. Jack placed himself on the con-  trary side of the pit, fartherest from the giant\"s lodging, and,  just at the break of day, he put the horn to his mouth, and  blew, Tantivy, Tantivy. This unexpected noise aroused  the giant, who rushed from his cave, crying : " You incor-  rigible villain, are you come here to disturb my rest ? You  shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I will have, and this  it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you for break-  fast," which he had no sooner uttered, than tumbling into  the pit, he made the very foundations of the Mount to  shake. " Oh, giant," quoth Jack, " where are you now ?  Oh faith, you are gotten now into Lob\"s Pound, where I  will surely plague you for your threatening words : what do  you think now of broiling me for your breakfast? Will</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='168'>This done, Jack filled up the pit with earth, and went to  search the cave, which he found contained much treasure.  When the magistrates heard of this, they made a declaration  he should henceforth be termed <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='magistrate;declaration;giant-killer;sword;belt;word;letter;gold' adjectives='embroidered' verbs='hear;make;be;term;present;be;write'>Jack</entity> the Giant-Killer, and  presented him with a sword and an embroidered belt, on  which were written these words in letters of gold</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='170'>u"The news of Jack"s victory soon spread over all the West  of England, so that another giant, named Blunderbore,  hearing of it, vowed to be revenged on the little hero, if  ever it was his fortune to light on him. This giant was the  lord of an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lone-  some wood. Now Jack, about four months afterwards,  walking near this wood in his journey to Wales, being  weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain and fell fast  asleep. While he was enjoying his repose, the giant, coming  for water, there discovered him, and knew him to be the  far-famed Jack, by the lines written on the belt Without  ado, he took Jack on his shoulders and carried him towards  his enchanted castle. Now, as they passed through a thicket,  the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack, who was strangely  surprised to find himself in the clutches of the giant. His  terror was not yet begun, for on entering the castle, he saw  the ground strewed with human bones, the giant telling  him his own would ere long increase them. After this the  giant locked poor <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='chamber;living' adjectives='giant;poor;immense;giant' verbs='lock;leave;go;fetch'>Jack</entity> in an immense chamber, leaving  him there while he went to fetch another giant living in the "</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='177'>This dreadful noise had almost distracted Jack, who,  going to the window, beheld afar off the two giants coming  towards the castle. "Now," quoth Jack to himself, "my  death or my deliverance is at hand." Now, there were strong  cords in a corner of the room in which Jack was, and two  of these he took, and made a strong noose at the end ;  and while the giants were unlocking the iron gate of the  castle he threw the ropes over each of their heads. Then  drawing the other ends across a beam, and pulling with all  his might, he throttled them. Then, seeing they were black  in the face, and sliding down the rope, he came to their  heads, when they could not defend themselves, and drawing  his sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant\"s keys,  and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies tied by  the hair of their heads, almost starved to death. " Sweet  ladies," quoth Jack, ** I have destroyed this monster and his  brutish brother, and obtained your liberties." This said, he  presented them with the keys, and so proceeded on his  journey to Wales. Having but little money, Jack found it  well to make the best of his way by travelling as fast  as he could, but losing his road, he was benighted, and  could not get a place of entertainment until, coming into a  narrow valley, he found a large house, and by reason of his  present needs took courage to knock at the gate. But what  was his surprise when there came forth a monstrous giant</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='182'>"Sa/st thou so," quoth Jack; "that is like one of your  Welsh tricks, yet I hope to be cunning enough for you."  Then, getting out of bed, he laid a billet in the bed in his  stead, and hid himself in a corner of the room. At the  dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who  struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, think-  ing he had broken every bone in Jack\"s skin. The next  morning Jack, laughing in his sleeve, gave him hearty  thanks for his night\"s lodging. " How have you rested?"  quoth the giant ; " did you not feel anything in the night ? "  " No," quoth Jack, " nothing but a rat, which gave me two  or three slaps with her tail" With that, greatly wondering,  the giant led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl con-  taining four gallons of hasty pudding. Being loath to let  the giant think it too much for him, Jack put a large leather  bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could  convey the pudding into it without its being perceived.  Then, telling the giant he would show him a trick, taking a  knife. Jack ripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty  pudding. Whereupon, saying, "Odds splutters, hur can  do that trick hurself," the monster took the knife, and  ripping open his belly, fell down dead.</paragraph>

The king did his best  to persuade his son from it, but in vain; so at last  granted the request, and the prince set out with two horses,  one loaded with money, the other for himself to ride upon.  Now, after several days\" travel, he came to a market-town  in Wales, where he beheld a vast concourse of people  gathered together. The prince demanded the reason of it,  and was told that they had arrested a corpse for several  large sums of money which the deceased owed when he  died. The prince replied that it was a pity creditors should  be so cruel, and said, " Go bury the dead, and let his  creditors come to my lodging, and there their debts shall  be discharged." They accordingly came, but in such great  numbers that before night he had almost left himself  moneyless.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='186'>Now Jack the Giant-Killer, coming that way, was so  taken with the generosity of the prince, that he desired to  be his servant This being agreed upon, the next morning  they set forward on their journey together, when, as they  were riding out of the town, an old woman called after the  prince, saying, "He has owed me twopence these seven  years; pray pay me as well as the rest." Putting his  hand to his pocket, the prince gave the woman all he had  left, so that after their day\"s refreshment, which cost what  small spell Jack had by him, they were without a penny  between them. When the sun began to grow low, the  king\"s son said, "Jack, since we have no money, where  can we lodge this night?"

" " It is no matter for that," quoth Jack ;  "I myself will go before and prepare the way for you;  therefore tarry and wait till I return." Jack then rode  away full speed, and coming to the gate of the castle, he  knocked so loud that he made the neighbouring hills  resound. The giant roared out at this Uke thunder,  "Who\"s there?" He was answered, " None but your poor  Cousin JacL" Quoth he, "What news with my poor  Cousin Jack?" He replied, "Dear uncle, heavy news,  God wot !

" Why," quoth Jack, " I desire  nothing but the old coat and cap, together wiih the  old rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed\"s  head." Quoth the giant, "Thou shalt have them; and  pray keep them for my sake, for they are things of  excellent use. The coat will keep you invisible, the cap  will furnish you with knowledge, the sword cuts asunder  whatever you strike, and the shoes are of extraordinary  swiftness. These may be serviceable to you, therefore take  them with all my heart." Taking them. Jack thanked his  uncle, and then having overtaken his master, they quickly  arrived at the house of the lady the prince sought, who,  finding the prince to be a suitor, prepared a splendid  banquet for him. After the repast was concluded, she  wiped his mouth with a handkerchief, saying, " You must  show me that handkerchief to-morrow morning, or else you  will lose your head." With that she put it in her bosom.  The prince went to bed in great sorrow, but Jack\"s cap of  knowledge instructed him how it was to be obtained. In  the middle of the night she called upon her familiar spirit  to carry her to Lucifer. But Jack put on his coat of dark-  ness and his shoes of swiftness, and was there as soon as  her. When she entered the place of the evil one, she gave  the handkerchief to old Lucifer, who laid it upon a shelf,  whence Jack took it and brought it to his master, who  showed it to the lady the next day, and so saved his life.  On that day, she saluted the prince, telling him he must  show her the lips to-morrow morning that she kissed last  night, or lose his head. " Ah," he replied, " if you kiss none  but mine, I will." " That is neither here nor there," said  she ; " if you do not, death\"s your portion ! " At midnight  she went as before, and was angry with old Lucifer for  letting the handkerchief go.

At this  the courteous knight and his fair lady, after returning Jack  their hearty thanks, invited him home, there to refresh his  strength after the frightful encounter, and receive some  ample reward for his good services. But Jack vowed he  would not rest until he had found out the giant\"s den. The  knight, hearing this, was very sorrowful, and replied, " Noble  stranger, it is too much to run a second risk ; this monster  lived in a den under yonder mountain, with a brother more  fierce and fiery than himself. Therefore, if you should go  thither, and perish in the attempt, it would be a heart-  breaking to me and my lady.

Jack led him a long dance, in order that the gentlemen  and ladies might see; and at last, to end the matter, ran  lightly over the drawbridge, the giant, in full speed, pursu-  ing him with his club. Then, coming to the middle of the  bridge, the giant\"s great weight broke it down, and he  tumbled headlong into the water, where he rolled and  wallowed like a whale.

And  though many knights have tried to break the enchantment,  and work her deliverance, yet no one could accomplish it, on  account of two dreadful griffins which are placed at the castle  gate, and which destroy every one who comes near. But  you, my son, being furnished with an invisible coat, may  pass by them undiscovered, where on the gates of the castle  you will find engraven in large letters by what means the  enchantment may be broken." The old man having ended,  <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='man;hand;life;lady' adjectives='old' verbs='have;end;give;promise;venture;free'>Jack</entity> gave him his hand, and promised that in the morning  he would venture his life to free the lady.</paragraph>

When he had got beyond them, he found upon the gates  of the castle a golden trumpet hung by a silver chain,  under which these lines were engraved</paragraph>

Thus was the enchantment broken, and all the  lords and ladies who had so long been transformed into  birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes, and the  castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke.

He was witty, strong, and  valiant, by which means he subdued his enemies abroad,  and planted peace among his subjects at home. Neverthe-  less, in the midst of all his glory, his queen died, leaving  behind her an only daughter, about fifteen years of age.  This lady, from her courtly carriage, beauty, and affability,  was the wonder of all that knew her. But as covetousness  is the root of all evil, so it happened here. The king,  hearing of a lady who had likewise an only daughter,  for the sake of her riches, had a mind to marry her,  and though she was old, ugly, hook-nosed, and hump-  backed, yet all this could not deter him from doing  so. Her daughter was a yellow dowdy, full of envy and  ill-nature ; and, in short, was much of the same mould as her  mother. This signified nothing, for in a few weeks the king,  attended by the nobility and gentry, brought his deformed  bride to his palace, where the marriage rites were performed.  They had not been long in the court before they set the  king against his own beautiful daughter, which was done by  false reports and accusations.

The  reader will of course miss many of those with which  he has always been familiar  many for which the  term Fairy Tale has always seemed to him to have a  special connotation. One of the reasons for this is  that several of such tales are not of true native  growth, but were introduced from France by means  of the chap-book translations to which I shall have  occasion to refer presently. Another reason is to be  found in the complaint recently made by a distin-  guished writer that a good version of his old favourite,  Jack the Giant-Killer, was hard to procure. I have  indeed ventured to include a version of this particular  tale, though it can by no means be denied that time  and circumstances have dealt hardly with it, as with  many like it The story bears marks of the weathering</paragraph>

Nay, even many  of its outlines are broken and destroyed : it is but a  poor maimed thing, and, what is worse, it is by no  means solitary in its ruin.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='77'>This blurring of detail and destruction of outline,  moreover, only repeats within the limits of the indi-  vidual story what has been going on with every class  of traditions. Whole stories have disappeared, and  are disappearing from day to day. In England and  in Scotland we have perhaps managed to keep speci-  mens of every kind of traditional narrative ; but from  Wales one entire class  and that one of the most  important  has vanished utterly. The different fates  of English and Welsh folk tales lead us so far beyond  commonplace generalities about the decay of tradition,  that I am tempted to spend a few words upon them.  In doing so it will be needful first of all to explain  that Tales or Traditional Narratives are capable of  being divided into at least five classes  namely,  Sagas, Nursery Tales, Drolls, Apologues, and Cumu-  lative Tales. Beast Tales may perhaps be added as  a sixth class ; but most of the examples can be  assigned places in one or other of the classes pre-  viously named. I will not trouble the reader with a  definition of all these classes : it is only necessary for  my purpose to explain the first two.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='80'>A Saga is a traditional narrative which is believed  to be true, and which relates to some definite human  person who is held to have really lived, or to some  definite locality, or to the power and deeds of some  deity or other supernatural being or race of beings.  Frequently the human person, the definite locality,  and the supernatural beings are all brought together  into one Saga ; more usually two only of these  elements. But in any case it is essential that the  people by or among whom the story is told should  have faith in the veritable occurrence of the events  related. A Nursery Tale, or Mdrchen (to use the  simpler German name), on the other hand, is not  believed as an actual narrative of fact. Its hero is  quite unknown to history : its scene is not laid at any  special place or period. " Once up6n a time, in a  certain town or village," is a sufficient description of  place and period for the obscure son of a nameless  poor widow. Occasionally, it is true, names are fitted  to persons and localities. But they are selected at  random ; and we hear of Scotland, Norway, France,  or Spain, and their kings, not because it is intended  to make any assertion concerning those realms and  their monarchs to which our credence is asked, but  simply to assist the imagination in following the  flight of the tale. A Nursery Tale is, like a Saga, a  narrative which, for want of a better word, and as  opposed to Drolls, or comic tales, we must call</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='84'>A considerable number of English and Welsh folk  tales have been collected and written down. But  whereas Nursery Tales, or Mdrchen, form a large  proportion of the stories found in other countries,  those recorded in England are very few, while it  is a remarkable fact that not a single mdrchen has  been discovered in Wales. By far the greatest  number of English and Welsh stories are Sagas.  The connection between Sagas and Nursery Tales is  very close, in spite of the substantial distinction laid  down above. Indeed, so nearly are they related that  the same story is frequently told in one place as a  Saga about a well-known man, or locality, and in  another as a Nursery Tale, without any greater claim  upon belief as an account of actual events than the  fable of the Fox and the Grapes. Many of the  mdrchen of foreign nations assume in this country  the form of sagas. What the exact relationship is  between these two classes of stories has not yet been  determined. Did all these traditional narratives exist  first as Sagas ? and did men in the process of time,  and in the course of their tribal wanderings, forget  the persons and the periods and the places to which  properly belonged the incidents they remembered,</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='85'></paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='86'>INTRODUCTION. xi</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='87'>and continue to relate those incidents apart from  the names and other particulars ? Or were Nursery  Tales the first slow growths of human fancy ? and  after they had been floating about on the waves of  speech for awhile, did they one after another anchor  themselves at different spots and upon various human  and superhuman personalities, and thus obtain more  or less credit as facts ? Or again, are Sagas and  Mdrchen independent, but similar, growths, assuming  the one form in one set of circumstances, and the  other in a different set? The present state of our  knowledge does not admit of a definite answer to  these questions. Their solution, if it is ever to be  attained, must be wrought out in detail by tracing the  history of each story separately. But the determina-  tion of the relations of Saga and Mdrchen is not  necessary for the consideration of the present prob-  lem ; for in any case it is quite clear that both kinds  of tradition are of immemorial antiquity. Not only  do we find them both fully developed among distant  savages, such as the Hottentots and the American  Indians, whose grade of civilisation the Aryan races  had passed and left behind long ere the dawn of his-  tory, but the ancient Egyptians have bequeathed to  us stories of the same kind in manuscripts computed  by scholars to be at least five thousand years old.  And it is quite inconceivable that the Welsh alone of  all the earth were destitute of nursery tales. Moreover,</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='90'>the form and incidents of more than one of the  famous Mabinogion in the Red Book of Hergest are  such as to render it highly probable that they have  been evolved from miirchen. It is equally inconceiv-  able that the Anglo-Saxon race, which produced  Beowulf, the Robin Hood ballads, and Chevy Chase,  to say nothing of the masterpieces of imaginative litera-  ture whose authors we know, should have been poor  in those stories which earliest feed the fancy of the  child. Why then have these mdrchen disappeared ?</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='91'>We can only reply by conjecture. But it must be  observed, in the first place, that sagas, by their very  nature as pretending to record actual events, have a  greater chance of life than stories told only for  amusement, and that chiefly the amusement of  children. Grown-up men and women forget the  latter, or become ashamed of them, and try to believe  that they have forgotten them, while they still accept  and gravely repeat the former. These they tell to  travellers, who write them down for the information  of more advanced or more inquisitive peoples.  Credulous chroniclers weave them into their narra-  tives as authentic history. Preachers discourse on  them at large ; and moralists, or simply gossiping  writers of anecdotes, use them to illustrate some  laboured theme, or drag them in for their very  strangeness. In all these ways English and Welsh  sagas have become preserved in the amber of litera-</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='97'>ture ; and poets, enraptured with their beauty, have  rendered many of them imperishable as the mind of  man. But to the nursery tale, as such, these avenues  of transmission are closed. The continuance of its  existence depends upon its popularity with successive  generations of mothers and children. If anything  occur to diminish or destroy its popularity, it fades  out of memory and is no more. True, its separate  incidents, or the more striking of them, may retain  an independent life by virtue of their hold on the  collective imagination of the race. They may be  taken up into sagas, or even into other mdrcheny or  transformed into drolls; but the tale of which they  originally were part vanishes.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='98'>Now, could we suppose that by some means a  whole cycle of nursery tales should lose its popularity  and thus be lost, we should have exactly the state of  things we actually find in Wales, and to a somewhat  less extent in England, and perhaps the Lowlands of  Scotland. Every other European country possesses  an ample store of these narratives ; but few have  been recorded in the Scottish Lowlands, fewer still in  England, and none at all in Wales. It may of course be  said that they have not been sought for. Because they  are mostly recounted for the enjoyment of children,  who, as they advance in years, outgrow the infantine  condition of thought which delights in them, they are  less easy of collection.

Although he may  find persons willing to communicate their traditional  lore, he will not easily make them understand that he  can attach any importance to nursery tales, and when  he succeeds in doing this his story-tellers will simply  suppose that he wants to hear them in order to turn  them into ridicule, and will consequently pretend not  to know any. It requires, therefore, much patience  to extract them, and frequently they are only  discovered by accident. Yet, when all this is taken  into account, if the Welsh have any mdrclten remain-  ing, it is at least odd that none of them have been  recorded. We are accordingly driven upon the  supposition that they are lost ; and in looking for a  cause we must not omit from our consideration tlie  partial loss of similar traditions among the English  and Scotch. If we can find a cause sufficiently strong  common to all three nations, and not operating, or  not operating with anything like the same power,  among the other European peoples, we shall prob-  ably be right in assigning that as the true cause.  This is an historical enquiry which cannot be more  than summarised here.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='104'>A reason which would occur to most readers is  the spread of education, Scotland, since the days of  John Knox, has been covered with a noble network  of schools, wherein Scottish boys at all events have got  the rudiments of literary learning. In England, not-  withstanding many valuable foundations, education,  even of an elementary kind, has been greatly restricted  until the last few years. Yet throughout the country  such knowledge as existed among the unlettered  classes has been effectual to the destruction of most  of the native mdrchen in a somewhat curious manner.  Perrault"s tales, which achieved in France a popularity  so sudden and complete at the end of the seventeenth  century, were translated into English, and speedily  appeared in the form of chap-books with gaudy  covers and coarse woodcuts. These were dissem-  inated far and wide ; and Cinderella, Bluebeard, and  the rest we know so well, like the young cuckoo in a  sparrow"s nest, seem to have ousted the proper brood.  But in Wales the difference of tongue would have  prevented the irruption of these foreign stories.  Schools were not absolutely non-existent, but they  were very few and poor ; and we cannot lay to their  charge the loss of nursery tales. It must be due,  therefore, to some other cause, much wider, much  more powerful. I find such a cause in the <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='principality;cause' adjectives='such;cal' verbs='prevail;find;have' valence='5.53' arousal='4.17833333333' dominance='5.61833333333'>Evangeli</entity>-  cal Protestantism which has so largely prevailed,  not only in the Principality, but also in <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='principality;cause' adjectives='such;cal' verbs='prevail;find;have' valence='5.53' arousal='4.17833333333' dominance='5.61833333333'>Scotland</entity> and</paragraph>

Severer  in its repression of much of the gaiety of life than  any other religion influential in Europe, it has  frowned upon all imagination except that of a strictly  theological cast ; and it has substituted for the idle  tales of tradition the more edifying and veracious  histories of Noah, Jacob, and Samson. This is a  process which has been going on in England and  Scotland since the Reformation. In the latter  kingdom it was perhaps weakened by the cessation  of active religious propagandism down to the early  years of the present century, owing to the almost  entire absence of Nonconformity. In England, where  Nonconformity has always existed, the process has  been continuously more or less active, and doubtless  under its influence the obliteration of mdrchen from  the popular memory had already begun before the  introduction of the translations from Perrault"s work.  Since the Act of Uniformity, Wales, too, has never  been without Nonconformists; but, especially in  North Wales, their numbers were insignificant until  the rise of Methodism under the preaching of Howel  Harries and his coadjutors. At that time a religious  revival similar to, but proportionately much greater  than, that which was taking place in England  shook the Principality from end to end. It had an</paragraph>

It is no exaggeration to say  that the whole current of a nation"s thoughts was  changed. Sermons were substituted for football, and  religious meetings for drunken bouta Those who  could read read the Bible to their neighbours ;  spiritual concerns drew men together and formed the  staple subject of their talk. Nor was this a passing  phasa The clergy, a great number of whom, intruded  into their cures from England, were utterly ignorant  of the language, cared not for the salvation of souls.  Their duties were performed in the most perfunctory  manner ; and they gladly escaped from the pulpit to  *^"the alehouse, from sacred rite to rustic sport Harries,  Williams, and Rowlands, the fathers of the Welsh  Methodist revival, were men of another type. Sab-  bath-breaking, drunkenness, and swearing they could  not away with ; and dancing and the village games  seemed scarcely less evil to them, in the face of the  awful realities of life and death. They could not  afford to let their converts slip back into these  sinful practices ; and they accordingly formed them  everywhere into societies whose moral code, as well  as their orthodoxy, was of the narrowest and  most rigid description. Their teaching and example  quickened the faltering faith of kindred religious  bodies, and assured the overwhelming predominance</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='113'>of Protestant Nonconformity. In England, Whit-  field, Wesley, and the other leaders of the evangelical  movement were actuated by the same lofty motives  and pursued the same policy, though with more  partial success. The general result was beyond  all question beneficial. Apart from the effect for  which these earnest men looked and prayed  namely,  the salvation of souls  civilisation made a great  stride. Open immorality was suppressed ; brutalising  sports, such as cock-fighting, and other sorts of  ruffianism, were discountenanced. Men began to  have ideals of which not physical, but moral and  spiritual, force was the distinctive mark.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='114'>In such a movement it was inevitable that many  of the old popular traditions should be crushed.  The heart of the movement was the Bible ; and the  enthusiasm of the early Christians against classic  heathenism seemed to be revived and directed against  everything which did not savour of the Bible and  things divine. The ignoranct which had hitherto  enwrapped the peasantry began to be lifted ; but the  light that fell upon them was only that of theological  speculation and Scripture narrative. A careful quest  among the writings of the Fathers of Methodism   perhaps of other Dissenters  would probably reveal  condemnation repeatedly directed against lewd songs  and " old wives" fables," The tendency at any rate  of their teaching is unmistakable. But we must not</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='117'>forget that they themselves were extremely cre-  dulous. John Wesley"s diary teems with ghost  stories, stories of miraculous interpositions of Pro-  vidence, and so forth, in all of which he placed the  most implicit faith. His fellow-workers, both in  England and Wales, were to the full as trustful.  Hence they would readily accept soma sorts of folk-  tales. Nay, the imagination would be quickened  in certain directions under the influence of powerful  religious emotion ; and sagas of corpse-candles and  of evil spirits, whether ghost or devil, would become  doubly dreadful. But stories untouched by the  prevailing impulse, or which afforded no arguments  in favour of a preacher"s doctrine, would naturally  recede from view and be lost ; while if any were  condemned as idle or sinful they would cease to be  repeated by those who attached any importance to  the condemnation. Now, nursery tales are treasured  chiefly by women, for to their lot it usually falls to  narrate them to their little charges. But women are  peculiarly susceptible to religious feelings; and if such  stories were obnoxious to those whom they were  accustomed to reverence as spiritual guides, there can  be little doubt what the result would be.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='118'>The influence of such teaching would last as long  as the religious belief which called it forth retained  any hold upon the popular mind ; and its prohibitions  would be extended to every sort of fiction, though</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='121'>they might be modified in course of time. Within  my own knowledge, however, and doubtless within  the recollection of many of my readers, in England  the narration of nursery tales to children has been  discouraged, and, in some cases, forbidden, for reasons  in no wise diflfering from those I have indicated.  This is a subject on which no statistics can be made  available ; but I suspect that these objections to  mdrchen have been very widespread. And they have  been unquestionably reinforced by the discoveries of  the past century in physical science and by the  popularisation of knowledge. For many years the  voice of well-meaning persons has been heard in the  land exhorting mothers to feed their babes on the  milk of science and the bread of fact, and not to fill  young minds with fairy tales which are not true and  can do no good to them. It is a matter of thankful-  ness that these tedious beings are no longer listened  to as they were a generation ago, and that they  scarcely penetrated into Wales or into the remote  country districts of England and Scotland. Children  there were always bred up on stories from the Bible  and sagas of elves and goblins, ghosts and corpse-  candles. Facts such as these (and they were all  looked upon as equally authentic) cultivated the  imagination, and thus preserved for us many precious  fragments of old-world thought.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='122'>To the foregoing reasons must be attributed, I</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='125'>think, the large preponderance of sagas among the  folktales of this country. A collection like the  present, though it aims to be representative, may  perhaps be found to contain a proportion of sagas  great even beyond the proportion of such tales actu-  ally extant For not only does its plan exclude the  familiar adaptations of nursery tales from Perrault  and other French collections, but sagas are in them-  selves of greater interest than any other class of  folktales except mdrchen, and are therefore more  frequently the subjects of literary reproduction.  Probably, however, none but scientific students will  be concerned with the disproportion here hinted at;  and, after all, it may be replied that this volume is  not intended  mainly, at all events  for them. It  is addressed rather to readers whose interest has yet  to be enlisted in the fairy tales of science  of that  science which is the Science of Fairy Tales. For such  readers a few of the traditions of their fatherland may  perhaps be found a not inappropriate introduction.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='126'>That which is chiefly interesting in all these stories  is the question of their real origin and meaning. There  are some readers who, though not scientific students,  cannot be satisfied without some sort of an explana-  tion, some " philosophy," as they are pleased to term  it, of the stories. To such I might recommend the  plan adopted by several of the philosophers of  antiquity, and weighted amongst moderns by the</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='129'>authority of the great writer of The Instauration of  the Sciences. It is also the plan of the monkish  compilers of the Gesta Romanorum, who fitted their  stories with long-winded "applications," as if they  were expositions of moral and theological truth,  veiled by parable. The advantage of this mode of  exposition is that you are not at all concerned with  what the people who first told the story meant, or  how they came to tell it All that need be done is  to consider how you can exhibit your own ingenuity  by reading into the tale any meaning  preferably  an ethical one  that may happen to suit your taste.  Those who have the privilege of listening to the  sermons of some theologians know the process.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='130'>Theorists like Professor Max Miiller and his dis-  ciples cannot be put on even terms with clever people  of this kind, because they profess to tell just what the  others do not trouble about  namely, the origin and  true meaning of these tales. It does, however, seem  a pity they should hamper themselves by assuming  such a regard for facts. For in truth they have a  fine imagination, and it would be difficult to find  in recent English literature more picturesque, more  glowing passages than ajre to be met with in descrip-  tions of the sun-hero or the dawn-maiden and their  various adventures, as seen through the spectacles  of the Aryan philologists.</paragraph>

That is what  real students of folk-lore are doing. Discarding  ethical and literary prejudices, they strive first of all  to track custom, superstition, tale, or song back to its  earliest form and to discover its analogues wherever  they can find them. Next, they inquire what inter-  pretation, if any, do the people among whom the  custom, the superstition, the tale, or the song is rife  put on it ; what is their habit of thought, degree of  civilisation, previous history ; and what can we learn  by comparing the customs, superstitions, etc., of  nations in a similar condition. In these inquiries  special stress is laid on the principle that Tradition is  one and indivisible. Custom cannot be studied apart  from superstition, nor superstition from tale or song.  All are inseparably connected, for all go to form one  whole, which is the general body of culture possessed  by a nation, or, as it may happen, by a given class  within a nation. No doubt this is very laborious,  very dry perchance, when contrasted with the methods  expounded in The Wisdom, of tJie Ancients and The  Mythology of the Aryan Nations.

We are learning gradually  what kind of men our forefathers were, how they  really looked at the world, what was their social  and economic organisation, what were their religious  beliefs, and in what manner all these have been  gradually modified and developed, or else have  dwindled and decayed, down to the present  time. The fairy tales now presented to the reader  are survivals from a period when the supernatural  beings therein depicted, and the wonderful powers  wielded either by them or by mortals, were a vital  part of the belief, and exercised daily and hourly  influence on the sayings and doings, of everybody   even as similar creeds do on the barbarous tribes in  every quarter of the globe to-day. They were part  and parcel of a social and intellectual condition which  has passed, or is rapidly passing, away everywhere.  But behind this social and intellectual condition our  inquiries are leading us to the psychological problems  involved. Why did men believe in witchcraft and  totems, fairies and giants, gods and devils? Why  did they practise animal, and even human sacrifice,  the couvade, infant baptism, initiatory rites on attain-  ing manhood ? What is the meaning of their funeral  ceremonies? of their marriage laws? of the extra-  ordinary variety of regulations affecting social inter-  course? What mode of reasoning drew them to</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='141'>Here I can do no more than indicate in this feeble  and general way the vastness and fruitfulness of the  field laid open by the scientific method of investiga-  tion of the phenomena of Tradition. To attempt an  answer to these questions is not my present task. If  I have succeeded in awakening the reader"s interest  in the subject, the writings of the distinguished men  just referred to, and of other anthropologists, and the  works issued by the Folk-lore Society, will not fail to  reward him with that true pleasure which the really  earnest and scientific study of any subject always  gives.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='157'>In the reign of King Arthur, there Uved in the county  of Cornwall, near the Land"s End of England, a  wealthy farmer who had one only son called Jack. He  was brisk and of a ready lively wit, so that whatever he  could not perform by force and strength he completed  by ingenious wit and policy. Never was any person heard  of that could worst him, and he very often even baffled the  learned by his sharp and ready invention.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='158'>In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge  and monstrous giant of eighteen feet in height, and about  three yards in compass, of a fierce and grim countenance,  the terror of all the neighbouring towns and villages.  He lived in a cave in the midst of the Mount, and  would not suffer any one else to live near him.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='162'>over to the main-land, where he would furnish himself  with whatever came in his way. The good folk, at his  approach, forsook their habitations, while he seized on their  cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his  back at a time ; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would  tie them round his waist like a bunch of bandeleirs. This  course he had followed for many years, so that all <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='course;depredation' adjectives='many' verbs='follow;impoverish;have;be' valence='5.008' arousal='3.736' dominance='5.028'>Cornwall</entity>  was impoverished by his depredations.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='163'>One day Jack, happening to be present at the town hall  when the magistrates were sitting in council about the  giant, asked what reward would be given to the person  who destroyed him. The giant"s treasure, they said, was the  recompense.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='164'>So he furnished himself with a horn, shovel, and  pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in the beginning  of a dark winter"s evening, when he fell to work, and  before morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep, and  nearly as broad, covering it over with long sticks and straw.  Then strewing a little mould upon it, it appeared like plain  ground. This completed. Jack placed himself on the con-  trary side of the pit, fartherest from the giant"s lodging, and,  just at the break of day, he put the horn to his mouth, and  blew, Tantivy, Tantivy. This unexpected noise aroused  the giant, who rushed from his cave, crying : " You incor-  rigible villain, are you come here to disturb my rest ? You  shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I will have, and this  it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you for break-  fast," which he had no sooner uttered, than tumbling into  the pit, he made the very foundations of the Mount to  shake. " Oh, giant," quoth Jack, " where are you now ?  Oh faith, you are gotten now into Lob"s Pound, where I  will surely plague you for your threatening words : what do  you think now of broiling me for your breakfast? Will</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='2' num='170'>The news of Jack"s victory soon spread over all the West  of England, so that another giant, named Blunderbore,  hearing of it, vowed to be revenged on the little hero, if  ever it was his fortune to light on him. This giant was the  lord of an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lone-  some wood. Now Jack, about four months afterwards,  walking near this wood in his journey to Wales, being  weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain and fell fast  asleep. While he was enjoying his repose, the giant, coming  for water, there discovered him, and knew him to be the  far-famed Jack, by the lines written on the belt Without  ado, he took Jack on his shoulders and carried him towards  his enchanted castle. Now, as they passed through a thicket,  the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack, who was strangely  surprised to find himself in the clutches of the giant. His  terror was not yet begun, for on entering the castle, he saw  the ground strewed with human bones, the giant telling  him his own would ere long increase them.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='177'>This dreadful noise had almost distracted Jack, who,  going to the window, beheld afar off the two giants coming  towards the castle. "Now," quoth Jack to himself, "my  death or my deliverance is at hand." Now, there were strong  cords in a corner of the room in which Jack was, and two  of these he took, and made a strong noose at the end ;  and while the giants were unlocking the iron gate of the  castle he threw the ropes over each of their heads. Then  drawing the other ends across a beam, and pulling with all  his might, he throttled them. Then, seeing they were black  in the face, and sliding down the rope, he came to their  heads, when they could not defend themselves, and drawing  his sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant"s keys,  and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies tied by  the hair of their heads, almost starved to death. " Sweet  ladies," quoth Jack, ** I have destroyed this monster and his  brutish brother, and obtained your liberties." This said, he  presented them with the keys, and so proceeded on his  journey to Wales. Having but little money, Jack found it  well to make the best of his way by travelling as fast  as he could, but losing his road, he was benighted, and  could not get a place of entertainment until, coming into a  narrow valley, he found a large house, and by reason of his  present needs took courage to knock at the gate.

At the  dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who  struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, think-  ing he had broken every bone in Jack"s skin.

"  " No," quoth Jack, " nothing but a rat, which gave me two  or three slaps with her tail" With that, greatly wondering,  the giant led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl con-  taining four gallons of hasty pudding. Being loath to let  the giant think it too much for him, Jack put a large leather  bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could  convey the pudding into it without its being perceived.  Then, telling the giant he would show him a trick, taking a  knife. Jack ripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty  pudding. Whereupon, saying, "Odds splutters, hur can  do that trick hurself," the monster took the knife, and  ripping open his belly, fell down dead.</paragraph>

The king did his best  to persuade his son from it, but in vain; so at last  granted the request, and the prince set out with two horses,  one loaded with money, the other for himself to ride upon.  Now, after several days" travel, he came to a market-town  in Wales, where he beheld a vast concourse of people  gathered together. The prince demanded the reason of it,  and was told that they had arrested a corpse for several  large sums of money which the deceased owed when he  died. The prince replied that it was a pity creditors should  be so cruel, and said, " Go bury the dead, and let his  creditors come to my lodging, and there their debts shall  be discharged." They accordingly came, but in such great  numbers that before night he had almost left himself  moneyless.</paragraph>

Putting his  hand to his pocket, the prince gave the woman all he had  left, so that after their day"s refreshment, which cost what  small spell Jack had by him, they were without a penny  between them.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='240'>Long before Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,  there reigned in the eastern part of England a king who  kept his Court at Colchester. He was witty, strong, and  valiant, by which means he subdued his enemies abroad,  and planted peace among his subjects at home. Neverthe-  less, in the midst of all his glory, his queen died, leaving  behind her an only daughter, about fifteen years of age.  This lady, from her courtly carriage, beauty, and affability,  was the wonder of all that knew her. But as covetousness  is the root of all evil, so it happened here. The king,  hearing of a lady who had likewise an only daughter,  for the sake of her riches, had a mind to marry her,  and though she was old, ugly, hook-nosed, and hump-  backed, yet all this could not deter him from doing  so. Her daughter was a yellow dowdy, full of envy and  ill-nature ; and, in short, was much of the same mould as her  mother. This signified nothing, for in a few weeks the king,  attended by the nobility and gentry, brought his deformed  bride to his palace, where the marriage rites were performed.  They had not been long in the court before they set the  king against his own beautiful daughter, which was done by  false reports and accusations.

She went to the  queen, who gave her a canvas bag of brown bread  and hard cheese, with a bottle of beer; though this  was but a very pitiful dowry for a king"s daughter. She  took it, returned thanks, and proceeded on her journey,  passing through groves, woods, and valleys, till at  length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the mouth  of a cave, who said, " Good morrow, fair maiden, whither  away so fast ?

At last he saw the lights of a very large house in the  distance, towards which he turned his steps ; and when he  had reached it, he beheld within a large company of noble  ladies dancing. They were exceedingly beautiful, taller and  larger than women of the human race, and dressed in  gracefully-shaped linen garments. They circled round  with smooth and easy motion, singing a soft low song of  which the hunter could not understand the words. Among  them was one maiden who excelled all the others in beauty,  at the sight of whom our hero"s heart was inflamed with  love. Forgetting the fears of enchantment, which at the  first moment had seized him, he hurried round the house,  seeking an entrance, and having found it, he rushed in, and  snatched the maiden who was the object of his passion from  her place in the moving circle.

Oh, how madly jealous  Cherry became when she saw her master kiss this lovely  lady. However, the next day the master remained at  home to gather fruit. Cherry was to help him, and when,  as usual, he looked to kiss her, she slapped his face, and  told him to kiss the Small People, like himself, with whom  he played under the water. So he found out that Cherry  had used the ointment. With much sorrow, he told her she  must go home, that he would have no spy on his actions,  and that Aunt Prudence must come back. Long before  day, Cherry was called by her master. He gave her lots of  clothes and other things ; took her bundle in one hand, and  a lantern in the other, and bade her follow him. They  went on for miles on miles, all the time going up-hill,  through lanes, and narrow passages. When they came at  last on level ground, it was near daybreak. He kissed  Cherry, told her she was punished for her idle curiosity;  but that he would, if she behaved well, come sometimes on  the Lady Downs to see her. Saying this, he disappeared.  The sun rose, and there was Cherry seated on a granite  stone, without a soul within miles of her  a desolate moor  having taken the place of a smiling garden.

The sandy waste around the church is called the Towen ;  and this place was long the scene of the midnight gambols  of the Small People. In the adjoining village  or, as it  is called in Cornwall, the "church-town"  lived an old  woman who had been, according to her own statement, a  frequent witness to the use made by the fairies of the  Towen. Her husband, also, had seen some extraordinary  scenes on the same spot. From her  to me, oft-repeated  description  I get the following tale:  It was the fishing  season; and Richard had been to St. Ives for some fish.  He was returning, laden with pilchards, on a beautiful  moonlight night; and as he ascended the hill from St  Ives he thought he heard the bell of Lelant church tolling.  Upon a nearer approach he saw lights in the church ; and  most distinctly did the bell toll  not with its usual clear  sound, but dull and heavy as if it had been mufiled, scarcely  awakening any echo. Richard walked towards the church,  and cautiously, but not without fear, approaching one of  the windows, looked in. At first he could not perceive any  one within, nor discover whence the light came by which  everything was so distinctly illuminated. At length he saw,  moving along the centre aisle, a funeral procession. The</paragraph>

It was, Richard said, "as if it were a dead  seraph,"  so very lovely did it appear to him. The body  was covered with white flowers, and its hair, like gold  threads, was tangled amongst the blossoms. The body  was placed within the altar j and then a large party  of men, with picks and spades, began to dig a little hole  close by the sacramental table. Their task being  completed, others, with great care, removed the body  and placed it in the hole. The entire company crowded ^  around, eager to catch a parting glimpse of that beauti-  ful corpse ere yet it was placed in the earth.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='937'>Two serving damsels of this place declared, as an excuse,  perhaps, for spending more money than they ought upon  finery, that the pixies were very kind to them, and would  often drop silver for their pleasure into a bucket of fair  water, which they placed for the accommodation of those  little beings in the chimney corner every night before they  went to bed. Once, however, it was forgotten, and the  pixies, finding themselves disappointed by an empty bucket,  whisked upstairs to the maids" bedroom, popped through  the keyhole, and began in a very audible tone to exclaim  against the laziness and neglect of the damsels. One of  them who lay awake and heard all this, jogged her fellow-  servant, and proposed getting up immediately to repair the  fault of omission; but the lazy girl, who liked not being  disturbed out of a comfortable nap, pettishly declared "that,  for her part, she would not stir out of bed to please all the  pixies in Devonshire."

So, tempering mercy with  justice, the pixies were kind enough to let her oflF with a  lame leg, which was so to continue only for seven years,  and was alone to be cured by a certain herb, growing on  Dartmoor, whose long and learned and very difficult name  the elfin judge pronounced in a high and audible voice.

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='952'>Near a pixy field in this neighbourhood there h"ved on a  time an old woman who possessed a cottage and a very  pretty garden, wherein she cultivated a most beautiful bed  of tulips. The pixies, it is traditionally averred, so delighted  in this spot, that they would carry their elfin babies thither,  and sing them to rest. Often at the dead hour of the night  a sweet lullaby was heard, and strains of the most melodious  music would float in the air, that seemed to owe their origin  to no other musicians than the beautiful tulips themselves ;  and whilst these delicate flowers waved their heads to the  evening breeze, it sometimes seemed as if they were  marking time to their own singing. As soon as the elfin  babies were lulled asleep by such melodies, the pixies  would return to the neighbouring field, and there com-  mence dancing, making those rings on the green which  showed, even to mortal eyes, what sort of gambols had  occupied them during the night season.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='953'>At the first dawn of light the watchful pixies once more  sought the tulips, and though still invisible could be heard  kissing and caressing their babies.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='958'>At length, however, she died; and the heir who suc-  ceeded her destroyed the enchanted flowers, and converted  the spot into a parsley bed, a circumstance which so  disappointed and offended the pixies that they caused it to  wither away; and indeed for many years nothing would  grow in the beds of the whole garden.

Seeing a door open in the side of the barrow, he went  up to it, and looked in ; and there he beheld a large and  luminous house, full of people, women as well as men,  who were reclining as at a solemn banquet. One of the  attendants, seeing him standing at the door, offered him  a cup. He took it, but would not drink; and, pouring  out the contents, kept the vessel.

One winter"s evening the child refused to go to bed with his  mother, as he wished to sit up for a while longer, " for,"  said he, " I am not sleepy." The mother, finding remon-  strance in vain, at last told him that if he sat up by himself  the fairies would most certainly come and take him away.

As soon as the Druids  left them, the fairies, who never failed to take possession of  their deserted shrines, seemed to have had an especial care  over these stones, and any one who ventures to meddle  with them is sure to meet with some very great misfortune.  The- old people of the village, however, who generally know  most about these matters, say the stones were once a king  and his knights, who were going to make war on the king  of England ; and they assert that, according to old  prophecies, had they ever reached Long Compton, the  king of England must inevitably have been dethroned, and  this king would have reigned in his place, but when they  came to the village of Rollright they were suddenly turned  into stones in the place where they now stand. Be this as  it may, there was once a farmer in the village who wanted a  large stone to put in a particular position in an outhouse he  was building in his farmyard, and he thought that one of  the old knights would be just the thing for him. In spite  of all the warnings of his neighbours he determined to  have the stone he wanted, and he put four horses to his  best waggon and proceeded up the hill. With much labour</paragraph>

The judge was about  to sum up the case and refer the question to the jury,  when the defendant in the case, coming into court,  proclaimed aloud that he had yet another witness to  produce. There was a strange silence in the judgment-  hall. It was felt that something chilling to the soul was  amongst them, and there was a simultaneous throb of  terror as <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='throb;terror;something;witness-box;soul' adjectives='simultaneous' verbs='feel;be;lead;chill' valence='5.55909090909' arousal='4.22636363636' dominance='5.19545454545'>Tregeagle</entity> was led into the witness-box.</paragraph>

The spell  therefore put upon Tregeagle was, that as long as he was  employed on some endless assigned task, there should be  hope of salvation, and that he should be secure from the  assaults of the devil as long as he laboured steadily.

Before the day of meeting, the canny earth-tiller procures a  number of iron bars, which he strews among the grass to be  mown by his opponent; and when the trial commences,  the unsuspecting goblin finds his progress retarded by his  scythe continually coming into contact with these obstacles,  which he takes to be some hard species of dock. " Mortal  hard docks these!" said he; ""Nation hard docks!" His  blunted blade soon brings him to a standstill; and as, in  such cases, it is not allowable for one to sharpen without</paragraph>

Yet the* saint,  knowing human nature, determined on associating with it  some object of a miraculous character, which should draw  people from all parts of the world to Ludgvan. The saint  prayed over the dry earth, which was beneath him, as he  knelt on the church stile. His prayer was for water, and  presently a most beautiful crystal stream welled up from  below. The holy man prayed on, and then, to try the  virtues of the water, he washed his eyes. They were  rendered at once more powerful, so penetrating, indeed,  as to enable him to see microscopic objects. The saint  prayed again, and then he drank of the water. He  discovered that his powers of utterance were greatly im-  proved, his tongue formed words with scarcely any effort of  his will. The saint now prayed that all children baptised  in the waters of this well might be protected against the  hangman and his hempen cord ; and an angel from heaven  came down into the water, and promised the saint that his  prayers should be granted. Not long after this, a good  farmer and his wife brought their babe to the saint, that it  might derive all the blessings belonging to this holy well.

He signed the  sign of the cross over the child, and when he sprinkled  water on the face of the infant its face glowed with a divine  intelligence. The priest then proceeded with the prayer ;  but, to the astonishment of all, whenever he used the name  of Jesus, the child, who had received the miraculous power  of speech from the water, pronounced distinctly the name  of the devil, much to the consternation of all present. The  saint knew that an evil spirit had taken possession of the  child, and he endeavoured to cast him out ; but the devil  proved stronger than the saint for some time. St. Ludgvan  was not to be beaten ; he knew that the spirit was a restless  soul, which had been exorcised from Treassow, and he  exerted all his energies in prayer. At length the spirit  became obedient, and left the child. He was now com-  manded by the saint to take his flight to the Red Sea. He  rose before the terrified spectators into a gigantic size, he  then spat into the well ; he laid hold of the pinnacles of the  tower, and shook the church until they thought it would  fall. The saint was alone unmoved. He prayed on, until,  like a flash of lightning, the demon vanished, shaking down  a pinnacle in his flight. The demon, by spitting in the  water, destroyed the spells of the water upon the eyes ^ and  the tongue too; but it fortunately retains its virtue of prevent-  ing any child baptised in it from being hanged with a cord of  hemp.

A few weeks after  his decease his wife married again. This circumstance  excited some attention in the neighbourhood. It was  remembered that the woman had lived on very bad terms  with her late husband, that she had on many occasions  exhibited strong symptoms of possessing a very vindictive  temper, and that during the farmer"s lifetime she had openly  manifested rather more than a Platonic preference for  the man whom she subsequently married. Suspicion was  generally excited ; people began to doubt whether the first  husband had died fairly. At length the proper order was  applied for, and his body was disinterred. On examination,  enough arsenic to have poisoned three men was found In the  stomach. The wife was accused of murdering her husband,  was tried, convicted on the clearest evidence, and hanged.  Very shortly after she had suffered capital punishment  horrible stories of a ghost were widely circulated. Certain  people declared that they had seen a ghastly resemblance of  the murderess, robed in her winding-sheet, with the black  mark of the rope round her swollen neck, standing on  stormy nights upon her husband"s grave, and digging there  with a spade, in hideous imitation of the actions of the men  who had disinterred the corpse for medical examination.  This was fearful enough ; nobody dared go near the place  after nightfall.

After much trouble, the important document  was discovered  not where it was first looked after, but in a  neighbouring parish. A mistake had been made about the  woman"s birthplace; she had not been baptised in St.  Ludgvan church, and had therefore not been protected by  the marvellous virtue of the local water. Unutterable was  the joy and triumph of this discovery. The wonderful  character of the parish well was wonderfully vindicated;  its celebrity immediately spread wider than ever. The  peasantry of the neighbouring districts began to send for  the renowned water before christenings ; and many of them  actually continue, to this day, to bring it corked up in  bottles to their churches, and to beg particularly that it may  be used whenever they present their children to be baptised.</paragraph>

Then it  would become so heavy she would have to lay her burden  down, on which the straw would become "quick," rise  upright, and shuffle away before her, till at last it vanished  from her sight with a laugh and shout.

Fearful indeed would be the strife between the man and the  demons ; and it sometimes happened that the spirits were  too powerful for the enchanter. He was, however, con-  stantly and carefully watched by his wife; and whenever  the strife became too serious, her harp was heard making  the softest, the sweetest music. At this the spirits fled;  and they were heard passing through the air towards the  Land"s End, moaning like the soughing of a departing  storm. The lights would then be extinguished in the  enchanter"s tower, and all would be peace. The servants  would return to their apartments with a feeling of perfect  confidence. They feared their master, but their mistress  inspired them with love. Lady Pengerswick was never seen  beyond the grounds surrounding the castle. She sat all day  in lonely state and pride in her tower, the lattice-window of  her apartment being high on the seaward side. Her voice,  accompanying the music of her harp, was rarely heard, but  when she warbled the soft love strains of her Eastern land.  Often at early dawn the very fishes of the neighbouring bay  would raise their heads above the surface of the waters,  enchanted by the music and the voice ; and it is said that  the mermaids from the Lizard, and many of the strange  spirits of the waters, would come near to Pengerswick cove,  drawn by the same influence. On moonlight nights the air  has often seemed to be full of sound, and yet the lady"s voice  was seldom louder than that of a warbling bird.

It is said that she  betook herself to Kynance Cove, and that there she raised  the devil by her incantations, and that she pledged her soul  to him in return for the aid he promised. The enchanter"s  famous mare was to be seduced to drink from a tub of  poisoned water placed by the roadside, the effect of which  was to render him in the highest degree restive, and cause  him to fling his rider.

The devil felt certain of securing the soul of the Witch of  Fraddam, but he was less certain of securing that of the  enchanter.

The tub  flew before the blow ; it rushed against the crock, which it  overturned, and striking against the legs of the old Witch  of Fraddam, she fell along with the tub, which assumed  the shape of a coffin. Her terror was extreme: she who  thought to have unhorsed the conjurer, found herself in a  carriage for which she did not bargain.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1362'>An old witch, in days of yore, lived in this neighbourhood j  and whenever she wanted money she would assume the  shape of a hare, and would send out her grandson to tell a  certain huntsman who lived hard by that he had seen a  hare sitting at such a particular spot, for which he always  received the reward of sixpence. After this deception had  many times been practised, the dogs turned out, the hare  pursued, often seen but never caught, a sportsman of the  party began to suspect, in the language of the tradition,  " that the devil was in the dance," and there would be no  end to it. The matter was discussed, a justice consulted,  and a clergyman to boot ; and it was thought that, however  clever the devil might be, law and church combined would  be more than a match for him. It was therefore agreed  that, as the boy was singularly regular in the hour at which  he came to announce the sight of the hare, all should be in  readiness for a start the instant such information was given :  and a neighbour of the witch, nothing friendly to her,  promised to let the parties know directly the old woman  and her grandson left the cottage and went off together ;  the one to be hunted, and the other to set on the hunt.

The huntsman and all the squires with their train lent a  hand to break open the door, yet could not do it till the  parson and the justice came up ; but as law and church  were certainly designed to break through iniquity, even so  did they now succeed in bursting the magic bonds that  opposed them. Upstairs they all went. There they found  the old hag bleeding, and covered with wounds, and still  out of breath. She denied she was a hare, and railed at the  whole party.

Thus the old woman escaped a worse fate for the time  present; but on being afterwards put on her trial for  bewitching a young woman and making her spit pins, the  tale just told was given as evidence against her, before a  particularly learned judge, and a remarkably sagacious jury,  and the old woman finished her days, like a martyr, at the  stake.</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1424'>Henry Burgwash, who became Bishop of Lincoln on  the 28th of May 1320, is chiefly memorable on account  of a curious ghost story recorded of him in connection with  the manor of Fingest, in Bucks. Until the year 1845,  Buckinghamshire was in the diocese of Lincoln, and  formerly the bishops of that see possessed considerable  estates and two places of residence in the county. They  had the palace of Wooburn, near Marlow, and a manorial  residence at Fingest, a small secluded village near Wycomb.  Their manor-house of Fingest, the ruins of which still  exist, stood near the church, and was but a plain mansion,  of no great size or pretensions. And why those princely  prelates, who possessed three or four baronial palaces, and  scores of manor-houses superior to this, chose so often to  reside here, is unknown. Perhaps it was on account of  its sheltered situation, or from its suitableness for meditation,  or because the surrounding country was thickly wooded  and well stocked with deer; for in the "merrie days of  Old England," bishops thought no harm in heading a  hunting party. Be this as it may, certain it is that many  of the early prelates of <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='prelate;palace' adjectives='early;certain;many' verbs='be' valence='6.024' arousal='3.544' dominance='5.824'>Lincoln</entity>, although their palace of</paragraph>

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1428'>Wooburn was near at hand, often preferred to reside at  their humble manor-house of Fingest. One of these was  Henry Burgwash, who has left reminiscences of his residence  here more amusing to posterity than creditable to himself.  ** He was," says Fuller, " neither good for church nor state,  sovereign nor subjects ; but was covetous, ambitious, rebel-  lious, injurious. Yet he was twice lord treasurer, once  chancellor, and once sent ambassador to Bavaria. He died  A.D. 1340. Such as wish to be merry," continues Fuller,  "may read the pleasant story of his apparition being  condemned after death to be viridis viridarius  a green  forester." In his Church History, Fuller gives this pleasant  story : " This Burgwash was he who, by mere might, against  all right and reason, took in the common land of many  poor people (without making the least reparation), there-  with to complete his park at Tinghurst (Fingest). These  wronged persons, though seeing their own bread, beef, and  mutton turned into the bishop"s venison, durst not contest  with him who was Chancellor of England, though he had  neither law nor equity in his proceeding." He persisted  in this cruel act of injustice even to the day of his death ;  but having brought on himself the hatred and maledictions  of the poor, he could not rest quietly in his grave ; for his  spirit was doomed to wander about that land which he had,  while living, so unjustly appropriated to himself. It so  happened, however, as we are gravely informed by his  biographer, that on a certain night he appeared to one of  his former familiar friends, apparelled like a forester, all  in green, with a bow and quiver, and a bugle-horn  hanging by his side. To this gentleman he made known  his miserable case. He said, that on account of the  injuries he had done the poor while living, he was now  compelled to be the park-keeper of that place which he</paragraph>

He therefore entreated his  friend to repair to the canons of Lincoln, and in his name  to request them to have the bishop"s park reduced to its  former extent, and to restore to the poor the land which  he had taken from them. His friend duly carried his  message to the canons, who, with equal readiness, complied  with their dead bishop"s ghostly request, and deputed one  of their prebendaries, William Bacheler, to see the restor-  ation properly effected. The bishop"s park was reduced,  and the common restored to its former dimensions; and  the ghostly park-keeper was no more seen.</paragraph>

He was  accustomed to perform the duty every Sunday, and was  conveyed to the church in his chariot through one of those  narrow, shady lanes for which that country was then so  justly famed. He died, and his remains were consigned to  the vault in the church of the above-mentioned benefice,  with much pomp and ceremony, and followed by a long  procession of friends, tenants, and the surrounding neigh-  bourhood. But his spirit was not supposed to rest in  peace. Villagers returning from their labours had been  terrified by the sound of carriage-wheels in the shady lane ;  and one had even seen the chariot itself drawn by headless  horses. The rumour spread, till it was confidently asserted  in the cider shops that "twelve parsons" had been con-  vened to lay the spirit in the Red Sea. Still, the lane was  believed to be haunted; and on investigating the reason  why the spell had not taken effect, it was conjectured that,  as one of the twelve parsons had been the intimate friend  of the deceased  as he knawed the trick  he would com-  municate it to him, and so render it abortive.

The family who resided there well knew the hovu: of the  night in which the ghosts made their appearance, and  always took care to go to bed before they came. But it  happened on a time that a child was very ill, and asked its  mother for water. She went to the pitcher to get some,  when the child refused any but such as might be got  directly from the pump. The mother became quite dis-  tressed, unwilling to displease the child, yet afraid to go down  to the pump, as it was about the hour in which the ghost  walked. She considered upon it a little while, and at last  said : " In the name of God I will go down." She did so.  Passing over the stairs she perceived a shadow, and then  she heard footsteps ; and when she came to the pump she  felt a hand on her shoulder. She turned and perceived  a tall man. Summoning a good resolution, however, she  said : " In the name of God, why troublest thou me ?

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1488'>Tradition accounts for the alleged hiding of the gold in  the following way :  One of the castellans in the middle  ages, named Bryan de Blenkinsopp, familiarly Bryan  Blenship, was as avaricious as he was bold, daring, and  lawless. He was once heard to say, when taunted with  being a fusty old bachelor, that he would never marry until  he met with a lady possessed of a chest of gold heavier  than ten of his strongest men could carry into his castle ;  and fate, it seems, had ordained that he would keep his  word. For, going to the wars abroad, whether to the Holy  Land to fight against the Saracens, or to Hungary to oppose  the Turks, we cannot tell, and staying away several years,  he met with a lady in some far country, who came up to  his expectations, courted her, married her, and brought her  home, together with a chest of gold which it took twelve  strong men to lift. Bryan Blenship was now the richest  man in the North of England ; but it soon transpired that  his riches had not brought him happiness, but the reverse.  He and his lady quarrelled continually  a fact which could  not long be concealed ; and one day when the unhappy  couple had had a more serious difference than usual, <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='formality;wife;reproach;couple;s;threat;reply;difference;lady;fact' adjectives='unhappy;utter;serious;rid;more;bitter;usual' verbs='be;get;conceal;indicate;hear;have;seem;mean;quarrel' valence='5.1534375' arousal='4.02625' dominance='5.385'>Six Bryan</entity> was heard to utter threats, in reply to his wife"s bitter  reproaches, which seemed to indicate that he meant to get  rid of her as soon as he could without any more formality</paragraph>

There is reason for believing that Ezekiel was the  legal adviser of this unfortunate Rosewarne, and that he  was not over-honest in his transactions with his client  However this may be, Ezekiel Grosse had scarcely made  Rosewarne his dwelling-place before he was alarmed by  noises, at first of an unearthly character, and subsequently,  one very dark night, by the appearance of the ghost himself  in the form of a worn and aged man. The first appearance  was in the park, but he subsequently repeated his visits in  the house, but always after dark. Ezekiel Grosse was not a  man to be terrified at trifles, and for some time he paid but  slight attention to his nocturnal visitor. Howbeit the  repetition of visits, and certain mysterious indications on  the part of the spectre, became annoying to Ezekiel. One  night, when seated in his office examining some deeds, and  being rather irritable, having lost an important suit, his  visitor approached him, making some strange indications  which the lawyer could not understand. <entity type='PERSON' common-nouns='god;name' adjectives='wantest' verbs='exclaim' valence='5.76' arousal='4.3' dominance='5.07'>Ezekiel</entity> suddenly  exclaimed, " In the name of God, what wantest thou ?

Presently she  struck violently upon a sunken rock, and her masts went by  the board, the waves sweeping over her, and clearing her  decks. Many perished at once, and, as each successive  wave urged her onward, others of the hardy and daring  seamen were swept into the angry sea.</paragraph>

They are  supposed to exist in one form or another in almost every  county, and few kinds of superstition have more strongly  influenced the credulous mind. To have the " black dog  on the back " has become a general phrase, though perhaps  few who use it have an idea of its origin.

It bears different names, but is always  alike supposed to be an evil spirit, haunting places where  evil deeds have been done, or where some calamity may be  expected. In the Isle of Man it is called the Mauthe Doog^  and, according to tradition, was accustomed to haunt Peel  Castle, where it was seen in every room, but especially in  the guard-chamber. Here, as soon as candles were lighted,  it used to go and lie down before the fire, in presence of  the soldiers, who became so accustomed to its appearance,  that they lost much of the awe which they first felt at its  presence. But knowing its malicious character, they never  ventured to molest it, till one of them, in a drunken fit,  swore that " he would try whether it were dog or devil ! "  He made his trial, and was instantly sobered, but rendered  speechless. He lived only three days afterwards, and then  " died in agonies more than is common in a natural death."

So he turned aside,  and passed through a gate at the end of the field. Night  after night he found the same dog in the gap, and turned  aside in the same manner. One night, having fallen in  with a companion, he returned homeward with him across  his neighbour"s field, being determined, if he found the dog  in the gap, to make an attack upon him, and drive him  away. On reaching the gap there stood the dog looking  even fiercer and bigger than ever. But the milkman, wish-  ing to appear valiant before his companion, put down his  milk-pails, which were suspended from a yoke across his  shoulders, and attempting to speak very bravely, thoug"a  trembling all over, he exclaimed : " Now, you black fiend,  I"ll try what ye"re made of!

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1597'>In the adjoining county of Hertford the same supersti-  tion prevails, and the black dog apparition is still a dreaded  bogie. Within the parish of Tring, but about three miles  from the town, a poor old woman was, in 1751, drowned  for suspected witchcraft. A chimney-sweep, who was the  principal perpetrator of this atrocious deed, was hanged  and gibbeted near the place where the murder was effected.  While the gibbet stood, and long after it had disappeared,  the spot was haunted by a black dog. The writer was told  by the village schoolmaster, who had been "* abroad," that  he himself had seen this diabolical dog. " 1 was returning  home," said he, " late at night in a gig with the person who  was driving. When we came near the spot where a portion  of the gibbet had lately stood, we saw on the bank of the  roadside, along which a ditch or narrow brook runs, a  flame of fire as large as a man"s hat. " What"s that ? " I  exclaimed. " Hush ! " said my companion, all in a  tremble \ and, suddenly pulling in his horse, made a dead  stop. I then saw an immense black dog lying on the road  just in front of our horse, which also appeared trembling  with fright. The dog was the strangest looking creature I  ever beheld. He was as big as a Newfoundland, but very  gaunt, shaggy, with long ears and tail, eyes like balls of fire,  and large, long teeth, for he opened his mouth and seemed  to grin at us. He looked more like a fiend than a dog, and  I trembled as much as my companion. In a few minutes  the dog disappeared, seeming to vanish like a shadow, or to  sink into the earth, and we drove on over the spot where he  had lain."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1602'>In some districts in the county of Lancaster, this spectre-  dog bears the names of "Trash" and "Skriker." Its  general appearance is the same as in other parts, but its  habits, and the object of its visits, seem somewhat different.  It does not haunt particular spots, but appears to certain  persons to warn them of the speedy death of some relation  or intimate friend. Occasionally, however, it gives its  warning, not by its appearance, but only by uttering a  peculiar screech, from whence it is called, in the local  dialect, Skriker. Its name, Trash, is applied to it because  the noise made by its feet is supposed to resemble that of  a person walking with heavy shoes along a miry, sloppy  road. If followed, it retreats, but always with its eyes front-  ing the pursuer, and either sinks into the earth with a  frightful shriek, or, if the pursuer averts his eyes from it for  a moment, it disappears he knows not how.

Many years ago, when the then master of the house, as his  custom was after the daily toils were over, used to settle  himself on one of these snug seats in the chimney corner, a  large black dog as regularly took possession of the opposite  one. This dog in all essentials resembled the spectre-dog  already described. For many nights, weeks, and months  this mysterious visitor, sitting vis-a-vis to the farmer, cast  a gloom over his evening enjoyment. At length, as he  received no harm from his companion, and became  accustomed to his appearance, he began to look on him as  one of the family circle. His neighbours, however, often  advised him to drive away the fiend-like intruder ; but the  farmer, not relishing a contest with him, jestingly replied :  " Why should I ?

The dog fled into an attic at the top of  the house, and just as the farmer entered the same room, he  saw it spring from the floor, and disappear through the  ceiling.

So late as the year 1856, a respectable  intelligent woman told the writer that she herself had seen  the dog-ghost. " As I was returning to Lyme," said she,  "one night with my husband down Dog Lane, as we  reached about the middle of it, I saw an animal about the  size of a dog meeting us. " What"s that ? " I said to my  husband. " AVhat ? " said he, " I see nothing." I was so  frightened 1 could say no more then, for the animal was  within two or three yards of us, and had become as large as  a young calf, but had the appearance of a black shaggy dog  with fiery eyes, just hke the description I had heard of the  "black dog." He passed close by me, and made the air  cold and dank as he passed along. Though I was  afraid to speak, I could not help turning round to  look after him, and I saw him growing bigger and  bigger as he went along, till he was as high as the trees  by the roadside, and then seeming to swell into a large  cloud, he vanished in the air. As soon as I could speak, I  asked my husband to look at his watch, and it was then five  minutes past twelve. My husband said he saw nothing but  a vapour or fog coming up from the sea."

But she had many bad  qualities. Amongst others, she was unnaturally cruel to  her only daughter, and had a sad knack of getting rid of  her husbands, having been married no less than four times.  At last she died herself, and, for her misdemeanours while  living, her spirit was transformed into a hound, and com-  pelled to run every night, between midnight and cock-  crowing, from the gateway of Fitz-ford, her former residence,  to Oakhampton Park, and bring back to the place from  whence she started a single blade of grass in her mouth;  and this penance she is doomed to continue till every blade  of grass is removed from the park, which she will not be  able to effect till the end of the world.

" I will,"  replied the weaver, " as soon as I have worked out my  quill" (the quill is the shuttle full of wool). "Nay," said  the vicar, "thou hast been long enough at thy work; come  down at once." So when the spirit came down the vicar  took a handful of earth from the churchyard and threw it in  its face. And in a moment it became a black hound.  " Follow me," said the vicar, and it followed him to the  gate of the wood. And when they came there, " it seemed  as if all the trees "vn. the wood were coming together, so  great was the wind.*" Then the vicar took a nutshell with  a hole in it, and led the hound to the pool below the water-  fall. "Take this shell," said he, "and when thou shalt  have dipped out the pool with it, thou mayest rest  not  before ! " And at midday and at midnight the hound may  still be seen at its work.^ It is difficult to understand why  the industrious weaver was consigned to such a hopeless  doom.

He was three or  four miles distant from his home ; and, much terrified, he  hurried onward as fast as the treacherous nature of the soil  and uncertainty of the path would allow ; but the melan-  choly yelping of the hounds and the fiendish shout of the  hunter came nearer and nearer. After a long run they  appeared so close upon him that he could not help turning  round to look at them. He was horror-struck, for he could  distinctly see the hunter and his dogs. The huntsman was  terrible to behold. He was black, had large fiery eyes,  horns, a tail, and carried in his clawy-hand a long hunting-  pole. The dogs, a numerous pack, blackened the ground  as far as it could be seen, each snorting fire and yelping in  the most frightful tone. What was the poor rustic to do ?  No cottage was near, no rock, no tree to shelter him   nothing remained but to abandon himself to the fury of  these hell-hounds. Suddenly a happy thought flashed into  his mind. He had been told that no evil spirit can resist  the power of prayer. He fell on his knees, and at the first  holy words he uttered the hounds stood still, but yelped  more dismally than ever ; and the huntsman shouted, *" Bo  Shrove !

The king, incensed at their proceedings, sent from his  court soon after some of his servants, to inquire of them the  reason of their incivility and ill-treatment, that he might  punish them by way of fine, or some other way he might  judge most proper.

	<paragraph num_entities='1' num='1673'>There once came to England a famous foreign professor,  and before he came he gave notice that he would examine  the students of all the colleges in England. After a time  he had visited all but Cambridge, and he was on his road  thither to examine publicly the whole university. Great  was the bustle in Cambridge to prepare for the reception of  the professor, and great also were the fears of the students,  who dreaded the time when they must prove their acquire-  ments before one so famous for his learning. As the period  of his arrival approached their fears increased, and at last  they determined to try some expedient which might avert  the impending trial, and for this purpose several of the  students were disguised in the habits of common labourers,  and distributed in groups of two or three at convenient  distances from each other along <entity type='LOCATION' common-nouns='arrival;distance;group;habit;professor;period;trial;labourer;purpose;student;fear' adjectives='last;convenient;other;common;expedient;several;impending' verbs='try;avert;be;distribute;increase;disguise;expect;determine;approach' valence='5.39285714286' arousal='4.09214285714' dominance='5.44964285714'>the road</entity> by which the  professor was expected.</paragraph>

The professor was still</paragraph>

So all the rest of the way he was musing  on the mode of examination he should adopt, and just as  he reached the outskirts of the town, he came to the deter-  mination that he would examine them by signs. As soon,  therefore, as he had alighted from his carriage, he lost no  time in making known this novel method of examina-  tion.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1679'>Now the students had never calculated on such a result  as this from their stratagem, and they were, as might well  be expected, sadly disappointed. There was one student in  particular who had been studying very hard, and who was  expected by everybody to gain the prize at the examination,  and, as the idlest student in the university had the same  chance of guessing the signs of the professor as himself, he  was in very low spirits about it. When the day of examina-  tion arrived, instead of attending it, he was walking sadly  and mournfully by the banks of the river, near the mill, and  it happened that the miller, who was a merry fellow, and  used to talk with this student as he passed the mill in his  walks, saw him, and asked him what was the matter with  him. Then the student told him all about it, and how the  great professor was going to examine by signs, and how he  was afraid that he should not get through the examination.  " Oh ! if that"s all," said the miller, " don"t be low about  the matter. Did you never hear that a clown may some-  times teach a scholar wisdom ? Only let me put on your  clothes, with your cap and gown, and I"ll go to the examina-  tion instead of you ; and if I succeed you shall have the  credit of it, and if I fail I will tell them who I am."

	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1683'>Well, just as the miller entered the lecture-room, the  professor had tried all the other students, and nobody  could guess the meaning of his signs or answer his ques-  tions. So the miller stood up, and the professor, putting  his hand in his coat pocket, drew out an apple, and held it  up towards him. The miller likewise put his hand in his  pocket and drew out a crust of bread, which he in like  manner held out towards the professor. Then the professor  put the apple in his pocket and pointed at the miller with  one finger : the miller in return pointed at him with two :  the professor pointed with three ; and the miller held out  his clenched fist. "Right!" said the professor; and he  adjudged the prize to the miller.</paragraph>
	<paragraph num_entities='0' num='1684'>The miller made all haste to communicate these good  tidings to his friend the student, who was waiting at the  mill; and the student, having resumed his own clothes,  hastened back to hear the prize given out to him.

" Ah ! " said the miller, " I"ll tell  you how it was. When I went in the professor looked  mighty fierce, and he put his hand in his pocket, and  fumbled about for some time, and at last he pulled out  an apple, and he held it out as though he would throw  it at me. Then I put my hand in my pocket, and could  find nothing but an old crust of bread, and so I held it  out in the same way, meaning that if he threw the apple  at me I would throw the crust at him. Then he looked  still more fiercely, and held out his one finger, as much  as to say he would poke my one eye out, and I held two  fingers, meaning that if he poked out my one eye I would  poke out his two, and then he held out three of his fingers,  as though he would scratch my face, and I clenched my  fist and shook it at him, meaning that if he did I would  knock him down. And then he said I deserved the  prize."</paragraph>
